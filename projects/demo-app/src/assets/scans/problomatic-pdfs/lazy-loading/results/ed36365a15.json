We used it as an example to argue that its inherently embedded spatial metaphor could compensate for the physical disconnectedness, and allow interaction on many different levels. Our paper proposes an interactive archiving and networking location where discourse is not only stored but categorised, analysed, retrieved and used to start new topics, or can be used to improve new debates. The focus is on the social values of PAP network and its empowering nature. The design and the structure is not simply a system for online socialisation rather it is a result of thoroughly studying available networks and their principles. It is a result of deep analysis of reality behind this community. We finally propose a set of principles that can secure a real innovative and creative knowledge exchange. \n\n\n\nseries\nASCAAD\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2008/01/21 21:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\necaade2007_086\n\n\n\nid\necaade2007_086\n\n\n\nauthors\nOxman, Neri\n\n\n\nyear\n2007\n\n\n\ntitle\nFAB Finding\n\n\n\nsource\nPredicting the Future [25th eCAADe Conference Proceedings / ISBN 978-0-9541183-6-5] Frankfurt am Main (Germany) 26-29 September 2007, pp. 785-792\n\n\n\ndoi\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.52842/conf.ecaade.2007.785\n\n\n\n\nsummary\nThe distinction between material behavior (mechanics) and material response (electronics) in the framework of responsive building skins has promoted unique design protocols for integrating sensor technologies into material components.

Beyond the realm of geometry, the concept of performance which may inform such manifestations also carries important potential for design generation. This work explores the relation between geometry and performance from a computational-geometry perspective. It does so by revisiting certain analytical tools offered in most of today's 3-D modelers which support the evaluation of any generated surface geometry specifically curvature and draft angle analysis. It is demonstrated that these tools can be reconstructed with added functionality assigning 3-D geometrical features informed by structural and environmental performance respectively. In the examples illustrated surface thickness (as a function of structural performance) is assigned to curvature values, and transparency (as a function of light performance) is assigned to light analysis values. In a broader scope this work promotes a methodology of performance-informed form generation by means of computational geometry. Vector and tensor math was exploited to reconstruct existing analytical tools adapted to function as design generators.\n\n\n\nseries\njournal\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2008/02/25 19:30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\nacadia07_182\n\n\n\nid\nacadia07_182\n\n\n\nauthors\nOxman, Neri\n\n\n\nyear\n2007\n\n\n\ntitle\nRapid Craft: Material Experiments towards an Integrated Sensing Skin System\n\n\n\nsource\nExpanding Bodies: Art  Cities Environment [Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture / ISBN 978-0-9780978-6-8] Halifax (Nova Scotia) 1-7 October 2007, 182-191\n\n\n\ndoi\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.52842/conf.acadia.2007.182\n\n\n\n\nsummary\nThe distinction between matter (mechanics) and information (electronics) in the context of responsive building skins has promoted unique design protocols for integrating sensor technologies into material components.

Pressure sensors added to these receivers allow real-time measurements of ocean depth, temperature and salinity, all of which provide significant information about climate change and the likelihood of natural disasters such as tsunamis.

Renovation or restoration projects of historic buildings can be more demanding, challenging and complex than traditional renovation of for instance within housing. Objective of this research has been to transfer ICT (information and communication technology) and BIM research findings to historic design practice and true renovation project environments. The concept of building information modelling BIM is a proposed integrative framework for all design and construction project information in digital form. BIM can currently be seen to be in a phase of pragmatic pilot projects in several countries. Nevertheless, BIM has not been tested that much in renovation projects yet, although the importance of renovation and restoration is remarkable within the total volume of western construction sectors. One essential conclusion of this study is, that renovation design work should be started earlier in model-based design projects than in traditional renovation projects. More resources have also to be assigned to earlier design phases, if BIM is intended to be used extensively throughout the project. Another finding is the new concept of an inventory model, which is proposed to be the container for all building inventory, survey and measurement data.

There has been a change from the classical method of architectural composition, in which rather than linking diverse shapes together in a static layout, dynamic actions inspired by the landscape are linked instead.\n\n\n\nkeywords\nLandscape; design process; composition; morphology; topology\n\n\n\nseries\nSIGRADI\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2016/03/10 08:57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\nacadia07_074\n\n\n\nid\nacadia07_074\n\n\n\nauthors\nPeters, Brady \n\n\n\nyear\n2007\n\n\n\ntitle\nThe Smithsonian Courtyard Enclosure: A Case-Study of Digital Design Processes\n\n\n\nsource\nExpanding Bodies: Art  Cities Environment [Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture / ISBN 978-0-9780978-6-8] Halifax (Nova Scotia) 1-7 October 2007, 74-83\n\n\n\ndoi\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.52842/conf.acadia.2007.074\n\n\n\n\nsummary\nThis paper outlines the processes involved in the design of the Smithsonian Institutions Patent Office Buildings new courtyard enclosure. In 2004, Foster + Partners won an invited international competition to design the new courtyard enclosure in Washington, D.C. Early in the project, the Specialist Modelling Group (SMG), an internal research and design consultancy, was brought in to advise the project team on computer modelling techniques, develop new digital design tools, and help solve the complex geometric issues involved. Throughout the project, computer programming was used as one of the primary tools to explore design options. The design constraints were encoded within a system of associated geometries. This set-out geometry performed as a mechanism to control the parameters of a generative script. The design evolution involved the use of many different media and techniques and there was an intense dialog between a large team and many consultants. The computer script was a synthesis of the design ideas and was constantly modified and adapted during the design process. The close collaboration between architects, consultants, and fabricators was of key importance to the success of the project. This project, now named The Robert and Arlene Kogod Courtyard, will complete in late 2007. \n\n\n\nseries\nACADIA\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2022/06/07 06:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\ncf2007_197\n\n\n\nid\ncf2007_197\n\n\n\nauthors\nPickersgill, Sean\n\n\n\nyear\n2007\n\n\n\ntitle\nUnreal Studio: Game Engine Software in the Architectural Design Studio\n\n\n\nsource\nComputer Aided Architectural Design Futures / 978-1-4020-6527-9 2007 [Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Computer Aided Architectural Design Futures / 978-1-4020-6527-9] Sydney (Australia) 1113 July 2007, pp. 197-210\n\n\n\nsummary\nThis paper investigates the relationships between conventional modes of architectural design, those represented through and mediated by Cartesian schema, and the radical organization of spatial experience available through the use of NURBS modelling. This is examined particularly through a study of how game engine software and the appropriate editors are able to accommodate the properties of both. Within this software the first-person view attempts to provide a normalised experience of the VR environment (usually a game), yet there is significant scope for experiencing radically other spatial and topological presences. Whilst considerable work has been done in the use of participatory digital spaces, there is the opportunity for examining the manner in which a highly stylised medium such as Unreal Tournament can productively assist the architectural design process.\n\n\n\nseries\nCAAD Futures\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2007/07/06 10:47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\ncaadria2007_519\n\n\n\nid\ncaadria2007_519\n\n\n\nauthors\nPorter, David; Raid Hanna\n\n\n\nyear\n2007\n\n\n\ntitle\nAn Empirical Investigation into the Influence of Media Types on Design Cognition and Methodologies\n\n\n\nsource\nCAADRIA 2007 [Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Computer Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia] Nanjing (China) 19-21 April 2007\n\n\n\ndoi\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.52842/conf.caadria.2007.x.x4b\n\n\n\n\nsummary\nThis paper reports on the findings of an empirical investigation into the impact of different media on design methodology. The statistical sample included 49 fourth year architecture students, divided into three groups: the drawing group, the physical model group and the computer group. They were given a problem of designing a façade in an urban context in Glasgow over a two week period. The design process of each group was monitored over that period through observations, recordings and attitude measurement via a questionnaire survey. The results were analysed using the Statistical Programme for Social Sciences (SPSS). The dendrograms from cluster analysis revealed that there were well established perceptual dimensions, or clusters, for the façades design variables within the three groups because of using different media. The impact of media on design creativity, both as a process and a product, was investigated. All three media types yielded a positive correlation between media made design decisions more creative and media made design scheme more creative- with a correlation coefficient of 0.708 which was significant at the 0.01 level, p&lt;0.05.\n\n\n\nseries\nCAADRIA\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2022/06/07 05:50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\necaade2007_146\n\n\n\nid\necaade2007_146\n\n\n\nauthors\nPost, Jelle; Koutamanis, Alexander\n\n\n\nyear\n2007\n\n\n\ntitle\nLinking Measurement, Simulation and Prediction\n\n\n\nsource\nPredicting the Future [25th eCAADe Conference Proceedings / ISBN 978-0-9541183-6-5] Frankfurt am Main (Germany) 26-29 September 2007, pp. 515-522\n\n\n\ndoi\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.52842/conf.ecaade.2007.515\n\n\n\n\nsummary\nIn the last decade Computational Building Performance Simulation (CBPS) has acquired the reputation of a solid analytical method. However, this reputation relies mostly on the admittedly advanced and robust theoretical and algorithmic basis of performance simulation techniques. On the practical side, building simulation has yet to live up to expectation. The main reason is that simulation use is not as widespread as it should. Applications are mostly academic, mainly validation studies. This has led us to the assumption that the applicability and usability of performance simulations require additional components that link them more closely to design processes and facilitate their integration in everyday design activities. In this paper we present the results of research into a working method for location-specific daylight simulation. Our method is based on the satisfication of a number of requirements common to many types of CBPS: validated simulation algorithms, flexible, fast calibration by means of real-world measurement, multiyear, location-specific environmental data, and support of both measured and mathematical environmental data models.\n\n\n\nkeywords\nSimulation, daylight,

We used it as an example to argue that its inherently embedded spatial metaphor could compensate for the physical disconnectedness, and allow interaction on many different levels. Our paper proposes an interactive archiving and networking location where discourse is not only stored but categorised, analysed, retrieved and used to start new topics, or can be used to improve new debates. The focus is on the social values of PAP network and its empowering nature.

Beyond the realm of geometry, the concept of performance which may inform such manifestations also carries important potential for design generation. This work explores the relation between geometry and performance from a computational-geometry perspective. It does so by revisiting certain analytical tools offered in most of today's 3-D modelers which support the evaluation of any generated surface geometry specifically curvature and draft angle analysis. It is demonstrated that these tools can be reconstructed with added functionality assigning 3-D geometrical features informed by structural and environmental performance respectively. In the examples illustrated surface thickness (as a function of structural performance) is assigned to curvature values, and transparency (as a function of light performance) is assigned to light analysis values. In a broader scope this work promotes a methodology of performance-informed form generation by means of computational geometry.

Renovation or restoration projects of historic buildings can be more demanding, challenging and complex than traditional renovation of for instance within housing. Objective of this research has been to transfer ICT (information and communication technology) and BIM research findings to historic design practice and true renovation project environments. The concept of building information modelling BIM is a proposed integrative framework for all design and construction project information in digital form. BIM can currently be seen to be in a phase of pragmatic pilot projects in several countries. Nevertheless, BIM has not been tested that much in renovation projects yet, although the importance of renovation and restoration is remarkable within the total volume of western construction sectors. One essential conclusion of this study is, that renovation design work should be started earlier in model-based design projects than in traditional renovation projects. More resources have also to be assigned to earlier design phases, if BIM is intended to be used extensively throughout the project. Another finding is the new concept of an inventory model, which is proposed to be the container for all building inventory, survey and measurement data. Even more so, when significant historic, hence more demanding building renovation is concerned, because there are more needs for various kinds of surveys, accurate data gathering and analyzing queries concerning the project.</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">keywords</th>\n<td>BIM, building information modelling, design process, design methods, reconstruction, renovation</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\"><a href=\"https://cumincad.scix.net/cgi-bin/works/BrowseTree?field=series&amp;order=AZ\" target=\"_blank\">series</a></th>\n<td>eCAADe</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">email</th>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">last changed</th>\n<td>2022/06/07 06:00</td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n<hr>\n<input name=\"idsigradi2007_af32\" type=\"CHECKBOX\">\n<table class=\"DATATABLE\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">_id</th>\n<td>sigradi2007_af32</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">id</th>\n<td>sigradi2007_af32</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">authors</th>\n<td>Períes, Lucas</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">year</th>\n<td>2007</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">title</th>\n<td>Morphology and Topology, the new digital media-based composition methods [Morfología y topología, nuevos procesos compositivos con medios digitales]</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">source</th>\n<td>SIGraDi 2007 - [Proceedings of the 11th Iberoamerican Congress of Digital Graphics] México D.F. - México 23-25 October 2007, pp. 112-116</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">summary</th>\n<td>This paper develops the topic of morphological generation of artificial landscapes using digital media.

Early in the project, the Specialist Modelling Group (SMG), an internal research and design consultancy, was brought in to advise the project team on computer modelling techniques, develop new digital design tools, and help solve the complex geometric issues involved. Throughout the project, computer programming was used as one of the primary tools to explore design options. The design constraints were encoded within a system of associated geometries. This set-out geometry performed as a mechanism to control the parameters of a generative script. The design evolution involved the use of many different media and techniques and there was an intense dialog between a large team and many consultants. The computer script was a synthesis of the design ideas and was constantly modified and adapted during the design process. The close collaboration between architects, consultants, and fabricators was of key importance to the success of the project.

The design process of each group was monitored over that period through observations, recordings and attitude measurement via a questionnaire survey. The results were analysed using the Statistical Programme for Social Sciences (SPSS). The dendrograms from cluster analysis revealed that there were well established perceptual dimensions, or clusters, for the façades design variables within the three groups because of using different media. The impact of media on design creativity, both as a process and a product, was investigated.

However, this reputation relies mostly on the admittedly advanced and robust theoretical and algorithmic basis of performance simulation techniques. On the practical side, building simulation has yet to live up to expectation. The main reason is that simulation use is not as widespread as it should. Applications are mostly academic, mainly validation studies. This has led us to the assumption that the applicability and usability of performance simulations require additional components that link them more closely to design processes and facilitate their integration in everyday design activities. In this paper we present the results of research into a working method for location-specific daylight simulation. Our method is based on the satisfication of a number of requirements common to many types of CBPS: validated simulation algorithms, flexible, fast calibration by means of real-world measurement, multiyear, location-specific environmental data, and support of both measured and mathematical environmental data models.</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th
