Cor-\n\nrespondingly, most additive and subtractive digital\n\nfabrication technologies assume the use of materials\n\ncharacterized by consistently uniform properties\n\nacross their volume or surface area (Zhang, Xu et al.\n\n2002). Inspired by formation processes in the bio-\n\nlogical world, where properly variation corresponds\n\nwith environmental stimuli, this research promotes\n\nthe integration of the finite-element method in a ge-\n\nnerative design context, supporting the controlled\n\nvariation of micro-structural material properties as\n\npart of form-generation and digital fabrication\n\nprocesses. Material variations are computed as func-\n\ntions of structural and environmental performance\n\ncriteria through the development of a material-based\n\nobject-oriented finite-element software environment\n\nable to compute and assign graded physical proper-\n\nties as continuous property gradients of a functional\n\ncomponent.\n\n\n1.1 Background\n\nThe basic iterative algorithm for finite element op-\n\ntimization is based on reducing material concentra-\n\ntion where it is not required for purposes of structur-\n\nal or mechanical performance, as defined by a given\n\nobjective function (Zienkiewicz and Morice 1971;\n\nJohnson 1987; Hughes and Hughes 2000;\n\nZienkiewicz and Taylor 2000; Zienkiewicz, Taylor\n\net al. 2005). A simulated solid block of any given\n\nmaterial will undergo formation changes during op-\n\ntimization resulting in structural efficiency across\n\nvarious product-, or building scale (Figure 1). In this\n\niterative process, stress distribution is iteratively cal-\n\nculated and elements with minimum stress values\n\nare removed. Such routine is implemented to cater\n\nfor a specific objective function (i.e. structural opti-\n\nmization) while assuming a relatively homogeneous\n\nmaterial distribution (Zienkiewicz and Morice 1971;\n\nZienkiewicz and Taylor 2000; Zienkiewicz, Taylor\n\net al. 2005). The optimization algorithm may be\n\ncombined with generative routines such as Genetic\n\nAlgorithms (GA) to assist with fitness evaluation by\n\nimplementing binary functions (“retain, or remove,\n\nmaterial”) at the scale of the element (Zwieniecki,\n\nBoyce et al. 2004).\n\nSimplified, the general iterative algorithm for fi-\n\nnite element structural optimization operates as fol-\n\nlows: (1) Begin with a solid block of material and\n\nspecified load conditions; (2) Run finite element\n\nanalysis to calculate stress distribution; (3) Check\n\nfor any elements at less than maximum allowable\n\nstress; (4) If such do not exist, then terminate, oth-\n\nerwise; (5) Remove some of the lowest-stressed\n\nelements; (6) Go to 2.\n\nFinite Element Synthesis\n\nNeri Oxman\nMediated Matter Group, MIT Media Lab\n\n\nABSTRACT\nFinite element applications have customarily been used as a means for the analysis of constant-property pro-\n\ntotypes prior to their physical fabrication. To a lesser extent they have been made instrumental for purposes of\n\ndesign generation and fabrication of variable material-property prototypes. The work explores the potential of\n\napplying finite element methods in the early stages of the design process and suggests a Finite Element Syn-\n\nthesis (FES) approach to the design of physical prototypes fabricated with variable material properties. The\n\napproach seeks to unify between analysis protocols and computational routines for design generation. With\n\nthe aim of achieving micro structural material property variation across the surface area and volume of a fa-\n\nbricated component, the FES software environment is implemented in a design exploration for building skins\n\nmodeled after various natural tissues that demonstrate the variation of physical properties as a function of\n\ntheir performance criteria. Two classes of explorations are suggested. The paper introduces the FES design\n\napproach, illustrates its virtual methodological set up, and demonstrates the approach through design explora-\n\ntions recently exhibited at the Museum of Science (Boston) and the Museum of Modern Art (NY). Future\n\nwork into material-based analytic routines for variable-property fabrication is suggested and its implications\n\non the various fields of design are reviewed.\n\n\nThe effect, basically, is to remove redundant ma-\n\nterial until the minimum amount necessary to per-\n\nform the structural task is left - at which point, all\n\nremaining material should be fully stressed; the al-\n\ngorithm then terminates. Such typical algorithm as-\n\nsumes materials of homogeneous properties (Figure\n\n2). The only possible element conditions, then, are\n\n\"full” of material or “empty”.\n\n\nFigure 1. Examples of various possible implementations of\n\nFEM in product, and building scale. Analysis protocols are tra-\n\nditionally devoid of generative-design and fabrication capabili-\n\nties.\n\n\nFigure 2. The Mercedes-Benz Bionic Car Project.

The fabricated material is characterized by homogen-\n\nous properties. Source: http://www.carbodydesign.com\n\n\nHowever, the designer may decide to vary the\n\nmaterial properties of a functional element (e.g. va-\n\nriable-density metal foam), such that it can conti-\n\nnuously vary from 0 (empty, no material) to 1 (full\n\nof the strongest available material), thus generating\n\ncontrolled heterogeneous material organizations\n\nboth in the virtual and physical domains. Such de-\n\nsign possibilities are at present considerably limited\n\n(Oxman 2010).\n\n1.2 Problem Definition\n\nApplications of the finite element method (FEM) are\n\ncustomarily used for the analysis of prototypes prior\n\nto their physical fabrication. The finite element me-\n\nthod is a numerical technique for analyzing a com-\n\nputer model of a given homogeneous material that is\n\nstressed or analyzed for specific results (Norrie and\n\nDe Vries 1973; Szabo and Babuška 1991; Moaveni\n\n1999; Zienkiewicz, Taylor et al. 2005; Moaveni\n\n2007). To a lesser extent has this method been made\n\ninstrumental for purposes of design generation or fa-\n\nbrication, particularly when the design involves he-\n\nterogeneous material properties (Oxman 2011). Cen-\n\ntral to this condition is the partitioning between\n\ndesign analysis, generation and fabrication, limiting\n\nthe possibility of fast iterations between virtual finite\n\nelement environments to digital fabrication plat-\n\nforms.\n\nTraditional design processes are instead stream-\n\nlined, and generally devoid of platforms supporting\n\nproperty-variation based analysis and fabrication\n\n(Oxman 2007; Oxman 2009).\n\n2 AIMS & OBJECTIVES\n\n2.1 Aims: FEM to FAB\n\nThis research explores the potential of [1] applying\nthe finite element method in the very early stages of\ndesign generation and fabrication and, [2] incorpo-\nrating heterogeneous material properties into FEM\nand FAB environments. Coupled with generative\nprotocols, this work suggests a hybrid, synthesis-\nanalysis approach to rapid fabrication platforms of\nheterogeneous material properties. The approach\nseeks to unify between analysis protocols and com-\nputational routines for rapid-fabrication, specifically\nadditive fabrication platforms.\n\n2.2 Objective [1]: Generative Synthesis\n\nThe objective is to apply the logic and computation\nof finite element approaches to the problem of de-\nsign generation by considering the synthesis of form\nas composed of finite-element units, each analyzed\naccording to spatial and material constraints.\n\n2.3 Objective [2]: Variable-Property Finite\nElement Fabrication\n\nImplementing the ability to synthesize and control\nmaterial distribution as part of digital form-\ngeneration; this research investigates design forms\nthat become possible when we can continuously\nvary material properties. This becomes particularly\nsignificant in considering not only structural optimi-\n\nhttp://www.carbodydesign.com/\n\n\nzation, but also insulating properties, transparency,\nand other architecturally relevant properties of mate-\nrials, which can be optimized against multiple per-\nformance criteria (Oxman 2010).\n\nWe propose a general approach to the problem of\ncomputational form-generation of shapes with conti-\nnuously varied material properties satisfying pre-\nscribed material conditions on a finite collection of\nmaterial features and global constraints.\n\n3 METHODOLOGY\n\n3.1 Distribution and Property-driven Finite\nElement Synthesis\n\nThe challenge of inverting an analytical routine to a\nsynthetic one requires the redefinition of the analyti-\ncal unit and mesh components as synthetic cellular\nentities which can be further connected, combined,\n“grown” or generated to form a surface, or a volume\nunit.\n\nWe propose two cases for finite element synthesis\nwithin a fabrication context: [1] Distribution-driven\nFinite Element Synthesis: this case corresponds with\nobjective 1, resulting in the coupling of generative\ndesign routines and FEA using additive fabrication\ntechnologies. Finite elements are spatially distri-\nbuted corresponding with external constraints. [2]\nProperty-driven Finite Element Synthesis. This case\ncorresponds with objective 2, implementing the first\nobjective within a variable-property material con-\ntext, using additive fabrication technologies. The\ntwo cases are conceptualized in Figure 3 below.\n\n\nFigure 3. Left: distribution-driven finite element synthesis;\n\nRight: Material-property driven finite element synthesis.\n\n3.2 Object-oriented Finite Element Analysis\n\nWe implement and further develop the Object\nOriented Finite Element Analysis (OOF) environ-\nment as the basis for these experiments. OOF was\ndeveloped by Prof. Craig Carter at MIT‟s Depart-\nment of Material Science and Engineering in colla-\nboration with the National Institute of Standards and\n\nTechnology (NIST), for analyzing the effects of mi-\ncrostructure on material properties (Cannillo and\nCarter 2000; Langer, Fuller Jr et al. 2001). It serves\nto predict material behavior under a range of objec-\ntive functions defined by the user. For any given 2-D\nimage of material specimens, one can analyze its\nphysical behavior based on a hypothetical assign-\nment of physical properties to geometrical attributes\n(Carter, Langer et al. 1998; Carter 2010).\n\nThe computation is performed using an image-\nbased finite element application. Physical properties\nare imposed onto the image after which a computa-\ntional mesh is created which includes the image-\nproperty information.  The computation produces\nvarious data sets including stress and strain data,\nheat flow, stored energy, and deformation due to ap-\nplied loads and temperature differences. The results\nare spatially analyzed and converted to a constructi-\nble data structure using Mathematica (Cannillo and\nCarter 2000; Langer, Fuller Jr et al. 2001).\n\nThe following research utilizes OOF‟s ability to\nintegrate a finite element approach with material in-\nputs. Further development of the software to imple-\nment 3D data for fabrication was carried out as\ndemonstrated in the design explorations (Figure 4).\n\n\nFigure 4. Methodological set-up implementing OOF in 3-D\n\nmodeling, analysis and fabrication context.\n\n\nThe input files include micrographs and simula-\ntions using all available micro-structural data with\nno mean-field approximations. Constitutive relations\ntranslating stresses into strains using Young‟s mod-\nulus are defined by the user. OOF converts an im-\nage, or a micrograph, of a heterogeneous, multi-\ncomponent material into a finite element mesh with\nconstitutive properties specified by the user.\n\n\n3.3 Variable-Density Fabrication\n\nWith the aim of achieving micro-, and macro-\n\nstructural material property variation across the sur-\n\nface and volume of a fabricated component, the\n\nsoftware environment is implemented in a design\n\nexploration for building skins modeled after various\n\nnatural tissues that demonstrate the variation of\n\nphysical properties as a function of their desired per-\n\nformance criteria. Two classes of explorations are\n\npresented that demonstrate distribution-driven and\n\nproperty-driven finite element synthesis and fabrica-\n\ntion.\n\n4 DESIGN EXPERIEMNTS\n\n4.1 Distribution-driven Finite Element Synthesis &\nFabrication\n\nImagine the case in which the size of a mesh-free\n\nparticle, applied for the purpose of form-generation\n\ninformed by light performance, precisely matches\n\nthe size of an imaginable powder molecule, or –\n\nmore realistically speaking – a material aggregate\n\nproviding for the substance of the 3D printing\n\nprocess. Such is the design motivation behind Ray-\n\ncounting – the form of which is mediated by envi-\n\nronmental and structural constraints.\n\nThe element unit can be thought of as an inter-\n\nmediary representation linking the digital form to its\n\nphysical manifestation, particularly when rapid fa-\n\nbrication processes are considered. In this respect,\n\nthe “element” provides for a lower limit material de-\n\nfinition establishing the degree of granularity re-\n\nquired to manifest the 3-D details of the design.\n\nFrom here, it is relatively easy to imagine the impli-\n\ncations of using „finite-synthesis elements‟ as the\n\nunits used for calibrating voxels and 3-D printing\n\npowder. The designer is generating 3-D form using\n\nthe precise units applied to describe its physical ma-\n\nnifestation.\n\nRaycounting is a prototype for a product skin de-\n\nsigned as a variable-translucency surface. The doub-\n\nly-curved 3D model is generated by integrating a 3D\n\ngenerative modeling environment (Rhinoceros 4)\n\nwith a finite-element application to determine sur-\n\nface thickness and material distribution as a function\n\nof a desired array of light effects.\n\n\nFigure 5.

Raycounting, Museum of Modern Art, 2008. 3-D\n\nprinted prototype demonstrating variable surface thickness in-\n\nformed by the Finite Element environment.\n\n4.2 Property-driven Finite Element Analysis &\nFabrication\n\nMesh discretization processes allow the designer to\n\nsubdivide a continuous mathematical domain into a\n\nset of discrete sub-domains referred to as elements\n\nand represented as singular geometrical entities. Lat-\n\ntices and triangulations are common rationalization\n\ndiscretization techniques, where quadrant and trian-\n\n\ngulated elements may respectively wrap the surface\n\narea or volume of the object. Such structural meshes\n\nare often implemented by engineers in order to si-\n\nmulate structural loads, analyze their distribution\n\nand predict any potential displacements that may\n\narise.\n\nFatemaps is a prototype demonstrating the inte-\n\ngration of variable-property material data with mod-\n\neling and fabrication routines. This process allows\n\nthe designer to import any physical tissue data sam-\n\npled from the physical world, and embed its proper-\n\nties as part of a 3-D modeling and fabrication envi-\n\nronment. The study explores natural tissues\n\nreconstruction by calibrating the size, shape and\n\nproximity of each element comprising the tissue to\n\nthe size and shape of the material unit from which\n\nthe form is to be fabricated (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7.

De-\n\ntailed view of 3-D printed tissue.\n\n5 CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nFinite element analysis methods and their practical\napplications are primarily applied to evaluate a giv-\nen design relative to some objective function. Cur-\nrently advanced applications exist that support the\nintegration of form-generation and evaluation from a\nstructural perspective. Such are, for instance, tools\ndeveloped for automobile shape optimization rou-\ntines based on the types of loads considered, their\nmagnitudes and directions. However, despite their\ngenerative advantage, such tools have yet to incor-\nporate variable-material data as part of the form-\ngeneration and fabrication processes.\n\nThe Finite Synthesis Method (FSM) was devel-\noped as a theoretical approach and methodology\nsupporting the integration of modeling and analysis\nroutines in the process of digital fabrication. It af-\nfords the designer the ability to consider analysis\ntools in their generative capacities while correspond-\ning to variable-property material data. In order to\nfurther implement this approach within a design en-\nvironment, the concept of finite element synthesis\nhas been introduced, whereby each element as de-\nfined by the FE application may contain, in addition\nto its structural data, information regarding other\nperformance criteria that are of interest to the de-\nsigner. In this regard, each material element is re-\ngarded as a tensor element defined by indices nego-\ntiating various objective functions. This method\nsupports the distribution of properties across the en-\ntire surface area of the design object relative to the\nvarious architectural and engineering performance\ncriteria addressed.\n\nBeyond the notion of performance-driven inter-\n\npretations based on computational geometry me-\n\nthods, this work has also engaged with the notion of\n\ncomputational analysis as a source for strategizing\n\nmaterial distribution. Rather than breaking down the\n\ndesign into a series of componentized elements aim-\n\ning at straightforward and simplified assemblies, the\n\nexperiments undertaken in this research demonstrate\n\nan alternative approach favoring material distribu-\n\ntion over design strategies of composition and as-\n\nsembly.\n\n6 FUTURE WORK\n\nThe Finite Element Synthesis approach assumes and\nfacilitates the distribution of multiple material prop-\nerties as a function of site-specific constraints of var-\nious types. In other words, for each material ele-\nment, the size and shape of which is defined within\nthe FE software, there exists an array of related\nproperties specifically defined for that element. Fu-\nture work will focus on inventing new fabrication\nplatforms able to support variable material-property\n\n\nfabrication in the scale of the finite element applica-\ntion. In this case, each „element may be computed as\na physical entity both virtually and physically.\n\nCurrently there exist no fabrication technologies\nthat allow for the production of objects with gradual-\nly varying structural properties at the scale of prod-\nuct design and architectural construction. While this\nwork has demonstrated that such platforms are bene-\nficial given the potential advantages in terms materi-\nal and mechanical efficiencies, there are many tech-\nnical challenges yet to overcome. It is clear\nhowever, that an integrated approach to form-\ngeneration where fabrication processes play an ac-\ntive role in the form-generation and analysis process,\npromotes more efficient products and building parts\nto be fabricated allowing the designer to include\nevaluative functions early in the design process.\n\n7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe author wishes to thank Professor Craig Carter,\nfrom the Department of Material Science and Engi-\nneering at MIT for his collaboration in the design\nprojects, his insightful comments, and for providing\nthe initial methodological set up for this work\nthrough the OOF software, which has been made\navailable online.
