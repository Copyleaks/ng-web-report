After an introduction we review the many dynamical models proposed over the years for elucidating quantum measurements. The approaches range from standard quantum theory,\nrelying for instance on quantum statistical mechanics or on decoherence, to quantum-classical methods, to consistent histories and to modifications of the theory. Next, a flexible and rather realistic quantum model is introduced,\ndescribing the measurement of the z-component of a spin through interaction with a magnetic memory simulated by\na Curie–Weiss magnet, including N \u001d 1 spins weakly coupled to a phonon bath. Initially prepared in a metastable\nparamagnetic state, it may transit to its up or down ferromagnetic state, triggered by its coupling with the tested spin,\nso that its magnetization acts as a pointer. A detailed solution of the dynamical equations is worked out, exhibiting\nseveral time scales. Conditions on the parameters of the model are found, which ensure that the process satisfies all\nthe features of ideal measurements. Various imperfections of the measurement are discussed, as well as attempts of\nincompatible measurements. The first steps consist in the solution of the Hamiltonian dynamics for the spin-apparatus\ndensity matrix D̂(t). Its off-diagonal blocks in a basis selected by the spin-pointer coupling, rapidly decay owing to\nthe many degrees of freedom of the pointer. Recurrences are ruled out either by some randomness of that coupling, or\nby the interaction with the bath. On a longer time scale, the trend towards equilibrium of the magnet produces a final\nstate D̂(tf ) that involves correlations between the system and the indications of the pointer, thus ensuring registration.\nAlthough D̂(tf ) has the form expected for ideal measurements, it only describes a large set of runs. Individual runs\nare approached by analyzing the final states associated with all possible subensembles of runs, within a specified version of the statistical interpretation. There the difficulty lies in a quantum ambiguity: There exist many incompatible\ndecompositions of the density matrix D̂(tf ) into a sum of sub-matrices, so that one cannot infer from its sole determination the states that would describe small subsets of runs. This difficulty is overcome by dynamics due to suitable\ninteractions within the apparatus, which produce a special combination of relaxation and decoherence associated with\nthe broken invariance of the pointer. Any subset of runs thus reaches over a brief delay a stable state which satisfies\nthe same hierarchic property as in classical probability theory; the reduction of the state for each individual run follows. Standard quantum statistical mechanics alone appears sufficient to explain the occurrence of a unique answer\nin each run and the emergence of classicality in a measurement process. Finally, pedagogical exercises are proposed\nand lessons for future works on models are suggested, while the statistical interpretation is promoted for teaching.\nKeywords: quantum measurement

General features of quantum measurements\nFor this thing is too heavy for thee,\nthou art not able to perform it thyself alone\nExodus 18.18\nIn spite of a century of progress and success, quantum mechanics still gives rise to passionate discussions about\nits interpretation. Understanding quantum measurements is an important issue in this respect, since measurements are\na privileged means to grasp the microscopic physical quantities. Two major steps in this direction were already taken\nin the early days. In 1926, Born gave the expression of the probabilities2 of the various possible outcomes of an ideal\nquantum measurement [1], thereby providing a probabilistic foundation for the wave mechanics. In 1927 Heisenberg\nconceived the first models of quantum measurements [2, 3] that were five years later extended and formalized by\nvon Neumann [4]. The problem was thus formulated as a mathematical contradiction: the Schrödinger equation and\nthe projection postulate of von Neumann are incompatible. Since then, many theorists have worked out models of\nquantum measurements, with the aim of understanding not merely the dynamics of such processes, but in particular\nsolving the so-called measurement problem. This problem is raised by a conceptual contrast between quantum theory,\nwhich is irreducibly probabilistic, and our macroscopic experience, in which an individual process results in a well\ndefined outcome. If a measurement is treated as a quantum physical process, in which the tested system interacts with\nan apparatus, the superposition principle seems to preclude the occurrence of a unique outcome, whereas each single\nrun of a quantum measurement should yield a unique result. The challenge has remained to fully explain how this\nproperty emerges, ideally without introducing new ingredients, that is, from the mere laws of quantum mechanics\nalone. Many authors have tackled this deep problem of measurements with the help of models so as to get insight\non the interpretation of quantum mechanics. For historical overviews of the respective steps in the development of\nthe theory and its interpretation, see the books by Jammer [5, 6] and by Mehra and Rechenberg [7]. The tasks we\n2 Born wrote: “Will man dieses Resultat korpuskular umdeuten, so ist nur eine Interpretation möglich: Φ\nn,m (α, β, γ) bestimmt die\nWahrscheinlichkeit1 ) dafür, daß das aus der z-Richtung kommende Elektron in die durch α, β, γ bestimmte Richtung [· · ·] geworfen wird”, with\nthe footnote: “1 ) Anmerkung bei der Korrektur: Genauere Überlegung zeigt, daß die Wahrscheinlichkeit dem Quadrat der Größe Φnm proportional\nist”. In translation from Wheeler and Zurek [8]: “Only one interpretation is possible: Φn,m gives the probability1 ) for the electron . . . ”, and the\nfootnote: “ 1 ) Addition in proof: More careful consideration shows that the probability is proportional to the square of the quantity Φn,m .”\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n7\n\nundertake in this paper are first to review these works, then to solve in full detail a specific family of dynamical models\nand to finally draw conclusions from their solutions.\n1.1. Measurements and interpretation of quantum mechanics\nQuis custodiet ipsos custodes? 3\nFew textbooks of quantum mechanics dwell upon questions of interpretation or upon quantum measurements, in\nspite of their importance in the comprehension of the theory. Generations of students have therefore stumbled over\nthe problem of measurement, before leaving it aside when they pursued research work. Most physicists have never\nreturned to it, considering that it is not worth spending time on a problem which “probably cannot be solved” and\nwhich has in practice little implication on physical predictions. Such a fatalistic attitude has emerged after the efforts of\nthe brightest physicists, including Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, von Neumann and Wigner, failed to lead to a universally\naccepted solution or even viewpoint; see for reviews [4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. However, the measurement problem\nhas never been forgotten, owing to its intimate connection with the foundations of quantum mechanics, which it may\nhelp to formulate more sharply, and owing to its philosophical implications.\nIn this review we shall focus on the simplest measurements, ideal projective measurements [4], and shall consider\nnon-idealities and unsuccessful processes only occasionally and in section 8. While standard courses deal mainly with\nthis type of measurement, it is interesting to mention that the first experiment based on a nearly ideal measurement\nwas carried out only recently [15]. An optical analog of a von Neumann measurement has been proposed too [16].\nExperimentalists meet the theoretical discussions about quantum measurements with a feeling of speaking different languages. While theorists ponder about the initial pure state of the apparatus, the collapse of its wave packet\nand the question “when and in which basis does this collapse occur” and “how does this collapse agree with the\nSchrödinger equation”, experimentalists deal with different issues, such as choosing an appropriate apparatus for the\ndesired experiment or stabilizing it before the measurement starts. If an experimentalist were asked to describe one\ncubic nanometer of his apparatus in theoretical terms, he would surely start with a quantum mechanical approach.\nBut this raises the question whether it is possible to describe the whole apparatus, and also its dynamics, i. e., the\ndynamics and outcome of the measurement, by quantum mechanics itself. It is this question that we shall answer\npositively in the present work, thus closing the gap between what experimentalists intuitively feel and the formulation\nof the theory of ideal quantum measurements. To do so, we shall consider models that encompass the points relevant\nto experimentalists.\nAs said above, for theorists there has remained another unsolved paradox, even deeper than previous ones, the\nso-called quantum measurement problem: How can quantum mechanics, with its superposition principle, be compatible with the fact that each individual run of a quantum measurement yields a well-defined outcome? This uniqueness\nis at variance with the description of the measurement process by means of a pure state, the evolution of which is\ngoverned by the Schrödinger equation. Many workers believe that the quantum measurement problem cannot be answered within quantum mechanics. Some of them then hope that a hypothetical “sub-quantum theory”, more basic\nthan standard quantum mechanics, might predict what happens in individual systems [17, 18, 19, 20]. Our purpose\nis, however, to prove that the probabilistic framework of quantum mechanics is sufficient, in spite of conceptual difficulties, to explain that the outcome of a single measurement is unique although unpredictable within this probabilistic\nframework (section 11). We thus wish to show that quantum theory not only predicts the probabilities for the various possible outcomes of a set of measurements – as a minimalist attitude would state – but also accounts for the\nuniqueness of the result of each run.\nA measurement is the only means through which information may be gained about a physical system S [4, 8, 9, 10,\n11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22]. Both in classical and in quantum physics, it is a dynamical process which couples this system\nS to another system, the apparatus A. Some correlations are thereby generated between the initial (and possibly final)\nstate of S and the final state of A. Observation of A, in particular the value indicated by its pointer, then allows us to\ngain by inference some quantitative information about S. A measurement thus involves, in one way or another, the\nobservers4 . It also has statistical features, through unavoidable uncertainties and, more deeply, through the irreducibly\nprobabilistic nature of our description of quantum systems.\n3 Who will watch the watchers themselves?\n4 We shall make the case that observation itself does not influence the outcome of the quantum measurement\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n8\n\nThroughout decades many thoughts were therefore devoted to quantum measurements in relation to the interpretation of quantum theory. Both Einstein [23] and de Broglie [24] spent much time on such questions after their first\ndiscovery; the issue of quantum measurements was formulated by Heisenberg [2, 3] and put in a mathematically precise form by von Neumann [4]; the foundations of quantum mechanics were reconsidered in this light by people like\nBohm [18, 19] or Everett [25, 26] in the fifties; hidden variables were discussed by Bell in the sixties [27]; the use of a\nstatistical interpretation to analyze quantum measurements was then advocated by Park [28], Blokhintsev [10, 11] and\nBallentine [9] (subtleties of the statistical interpretation are underlined by Home and Whitaker [29]); the most relevant\npapers were collected by Wheeler and Zurek in 1983 [8]. Earlier reviews on this problem were given by London and\nBauer [30] and Wigner [13]. We can presently witness a renewed interest for measurement theory; among many recent\ncontributions we may mention the book of de Muynck [31] and the review articles by Schlosshauer [32] and Zurek\n[33]. Extensive references are given in the pedagogical article [34] and book [35] by Laloë which review paradoxes\nand interpretations of quantum mechanics. Indeed, these questions have escaped the realm of speculation owing to\nprogresses in experimental physics which allow to tackle the foundations of quantum mechanics from different angles. Not only Bell’s inequalities [27, 34, 36] but also the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) logical paradox [37]\nhave been tested experimentally [38]. Moreover, rather than considering cases where quantum interference terms (the\ninfamous “Schrödinger cat problem” [8, 13, 39]) vanish owing to decoherence processes [40], experimentalists have\nbecome able to control these very interferences [41], which are essential to describe the physics of quantum superpositions of macroscopic states and to explore the new possibilities offered by quantum information [22, 42]. Examples\ninclude left and right going currents in superconducting circuits [15, 43, 44, 45], macroscopic atomic ensembles [41]\nand entangled mechanical oscillators [46].\n1.1.1. Classical versus quantum measurements: von Neumann-Wigner theory\nWhen the cat and the mouse agree,\nthe grocer is ruined\nIranian proverb\nThe difficulties arise from two major differences between quantum and classical measurements, stressed in most\ntextbooks [4, 3, 47, 48].\n(i) In classical physics it was legitimate to imagine that quantities such as the position and the momentum of a\nstructureless particle like an electron might in principle be measured with increasingly large precision; this allowed\nus to regard both of them as well-defined physical quantities. (We return in section 10 to the meaning of physical\nquantities and of states within the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics.) This is no longer true in quantum mechanics, where we cannot forget about the random nature of physical quantities. Statistical fluctuations are\nunavoidable, as exemplified by Heisenberg’s inequality [2, 3]: we cannot even think of values that would be taken\nsimultaneously by non-commuting quantities whether or not we measure them. In general both the theory and the\nmeasurements provide us only with probabilities.\nConsider a measurement of an observable ŝ of the system S of interest5 , having eigenvectors |si i and eigenvalues si .\nIt is an experiment in which S interacts with an apparatus A that has the following property [4, 13, 30, 47]. A physical\nquantity Â pertaining to the apparatus A may take at the end of the process one value among a set Ai which are in\none-to-one correspondence with si . If initially S lies in the state |si i, the final value Ai will be produced with certainty,\nand a repeated experiment will always yield the observed result Ai , informing us that S was in |si i However, within\nthis scope, S should generally lie initially in a state represented by a wave function which is a linear combination,\nX\nψi |si i ,\n(1.1)\n|ψi =\ni\n\nof the eigenvectors |si i. Born’s rule then states that the probability of observing in a given experiment the result\nAi equals |ψi |2 [1]. A prerequisite to the explanation of this rule is the solution of the measurement problem, as it\nimplicitly involves the uniqueness of the outcome of the apparatus in each single experiment. An axiomatic derivation\nof Born’s rule is given in [50]; see [32, 33] for a modern perspective on the rule. Quantum mechanics does not allow\n5 The eigenvalues of ŝ are assumed here to be non-degenerate. The general case will be considered in § 1.2.3\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n9\n\nus to predict which will be the outcome Ai of an individual measurement, but provides us with the full statistics of\nrepeated measurements of ŝ performed on elements of an ensemble described by the state |ψi. The frequency of\noccurrence of each Ai in repeated experiments informs us about the moduli |ψi |2 , but not about the phases of these\ncoefficients. In contrast to a classical state, a quantum state |ψi, even pure, always refers to an ensemble, and cannot be\ndetermined by means of a unique measurement performed on a single system [49]. It cannot even be fully determined\nby repeated measurements of the single observable ŝ, since only the values of the amplitudes |ψi | can thus be estimated.\n(ii) A second qualitative difference between classical and quantum physics lies in the perturbation of the system S\nbrought in by a measurement. Classically one may imagine that this perturbation could be made weaker and weaker,\nso that S is practically left in its initial state while A registers one of its properties. However, a quantum measurement\nis carried on with an apparatus A much larger than the tested object S; an extreme example is provided by the huge\ndetectors used in particle physics. Such a process may go so far as to destroy S, as for a photon detected in a\nphotomultiplier. It is natural to wonder whether the perturbation of S has a lower bound. Much work has therefore\nbeen devoted to the ideal measurements, those which preserve at least the statistics of the observable ŝ in the final\nstate of S, also referred to as non-demolition experiments or as measurements of the first kind [31]. Such ideal\nmeasurements are often described by assuming that the apparatus A starts in a pure state6 . Then by writing that, if S\nlies initially in the state |si i and A in the state |0i, the measurement leaves S unchanged: the compound system S + A\nevolves from |si i |0i to |si i |Ai i, where |Ai i is an eigenvector of Â associated with Ai . If however, as was first discussed\nby von Neumann, the initial state of S has the general form (1.1), S + A may reach any possible final state |si i |Ai i\ndepending on the result Ai observed. In this occurrence the system S is left in |si i and A in |Ai i, and according to\nBorn’s rule, this occurs with the probability |ψi |2 . As explained in § 1.1.2, for this it is necessary (but not sufficient) to\nrequire that the final density operator describing S + A for the whole set of runs of the measurement has the diagonal\nform6\nX\n(1.2)\n|si i |Ai i |ψi |2 hAi | hsi | ,\ni\n\nrather than the full form (1.3) below. Thus, not only is the state of the apparatus modified in a way controlled by the object, as it should in any classical or quantal measurement that provides us with information on S, but the marginal state\nP\nof the quantum system is also necessarily modified (it becomes i |si i |ψi |2 hsi |), even by such an ideal measurement\n(except in the trivial case where (1.1) contains a single term, as it happens when one repeats the measurement).\n1.1.2. Truncation versus reduction\nAshes to ashes,\ndust to dust\nGenesis 3:19\nThe rules of quantum measurements that we have recalled display a well known contradiction between the principles of quantum mechanics. On the one hand, if the measurement process leads the initial pure state |si i|0i into\n|si i|Ai i, the linearity of the wave functions of the compound system S + A and the unitarity of the evolution of the\nwave functions of S + A governed by the Schrödinger equation imply that the final density operator of S + A issued\nfrom (1.1) should be6\nX\n(1.3)\n|si i |Ai i ψi ψ∗j hA j |hs j |.\nij\n\nOn the other hand, according to Born’s rule [1] and von Neumann’s analysis [4], each run of an ideal measurement\nshould lead from the initial pure state |ψi |0i to one or another of the pure states |si i |Ai i with the probability |ψi |2 ; the\nfinal density operator accounting for a large statistical ensemble E of runs should be the mixture (1.2) rather than the\nsuperposition (1.3). In the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation, two separate postulates of evolution are introduced,\none for the hamiltonian motion governed by the Schrödinger equation, the other for measurements which lead the\n6 Here we follow a current line of thinking in the literature called von Neumann-Wigner theory of ideal measurements. In subsection 1.2 we\nargue that it is not realistic to assume that A may start in a pure state and end up in a pure state\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n10\n\nsystem from |ψi to one or the other of the states |si i, depending on the value Ai observed. This lack of consistency is\nunsatisfactory and other explanations have been searched for (§ 1.3.1 and section 2).\nIt should be noted that the loss of the off-diagonal elements takes place in a well-defined basis, the one in which\nboth the tested observable ŝ of S and the pointer variable Â of A are diagonal (such a basis always exists since the\njoint Hilbert space of S + A is the tensor product of the spaces of S and A). In usual decoherence processes, it is\nthe interaction between the system and some external bath which selects the basis in which off-diagonal elements are\ntruncated [32, 33]. We have therefore to elucidate this preferred basis paradox, and to explain why the truncation\nwhich replaces (1.3) by (1.2) occurs in the specific basis selected by the measuring apparatus.\nThe occurrence in (1.3) of the off-diagonal i , j terms is by itself an essential feature of an interaction process\nbetween two systems in quantum mechanics. There exist numerous experiments in which a pair of systems is left\nafter interaction in a state of the form (1.3), not only at the microscopic scale, but even for macroscopic objects,\ninvolving for instance quantum superpositions of superconducting currents. Such experiments allow us to observe\npurely quantum coherences represented by off-diagonal terms i , j.\nHowever, such off-diagonal “Schrödinger cat” terms, which contradict both Born’s rule [1] and von Neumann’s\nreduction [4], must disappear at the end of a measurement process. Their absence is usually termed as the “reduction”\nor the “collapse” of the wave packet, or of the state. Unfortunately, depending on the authors, these words may have\ndifferent meanings; we need to define precisely our vocabulary. Consider first a large set E of runs of a measurement\nperformed on identical systems S initially prepared in the state |ψi, and interacting with A initially in the state |0i.\nThe density operator of S + A should evolve from |ψi|0ih0|hψ| to (1.2). We will term as “truncation” the elimination\nduring the process of the off-diagonal blocks i , j of the density operator describing the joint system S + A for the\nwhole set E of runs. If instead of the full set E we focus on a single run, the process should end up in one among\nthe states |si i |Ai i. We will designate as “reduction” the transformation of the initial state of S + A into such a final\n“reduced state”, for a single run of the measurement.\nOne of the paradoxes of the measurement theory lies in the existence of several possible final states issued from\nthe same initial state. Reduction thus seems to imply a bifurcation in the dynamics, whereas the Schrödinger equation\nentails a one-to-one correspondence between the initial and final states of the isolated system S + A.\nWe stress that both above definitions refer to S + A. Some authors apply the words reduction or collapse to the sole\ntested system S. To avoid confusion, we will call “weak reduction” the transformation of the initial state |ψihψ| of S into\nP\nthe pure state |ψi ihψi | for a single run, and “weak truncation” its transformation into the mixed state i |ψi i |ψi |2 hψi |\nfor a large ensemble E of runs. In fact, the latter marginal density operator of S can be obtained by tracing out A,\nnot only from the joint truncated state (1.2) of S+A, but also merely from the non-truncated state (1.3), so that the\nquestion seems to have been eluded. However, such a viewpoint, in which the apparatus is disregarded, cannot provide\nan answer to the measurement problem. The very aim of a measurement is to create correlations between S and A\nand to read the indications of A so as to derive indirectly information about S; but the elimination of the apparatus\nsuppresses both the correlations between S and A and the information gained by reading A.\nPhysically, a set of repeated experiments involving interaction of S and A can be regarded as a measurement only\nif we observe on A in each run some well defined result Ai , with probability |ψi |2 . For an ideal measurement we\nshould be able to predict that S is then left in the corresponding state |si i. Explaining these features requires that\nthe considered dynamical model produces in each run one of the reduced states |si i |Ai i. The quantum measurement\nproblem thus amounts to the proof, not only of truncation, but also of reduction. This will be achieved in section 11 for\na model of quantum statistical mechanics. As stressed by Bohr and Wigner, the reduction, interpreted as expressing\nthe “uniqueness of physical reality”, is at variance with the superposition principle which produces the final state\n(1.3). The challenge is to solve this contradiction, answering Wigner’s wish: “The simplest way that one may try to\nreduce the two kinds of changes of the state vector to a single kind is to describe the whole process of measurement\nas an event in time, governed by the quantum mechanical equations of motion”. Our purpose is to show that this is\nfeasible, contrary to Wigner’s own negative conclusion [13].\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n11\n\n1.1.3. Registration and selection of outcomes\nNon-discrimination is a cross-cutting principle\nUnited Nations human rights, 1996\nWhen after a run of an ideal measurement, S is left in |si i, a second measurement performed on the same system\nleaves this state unchanged and yields the same indication Ai of the pointer. Reduction, even weak, thus implies\nrepeatability. Conversely, repeatability implies weak truncation, that is, the loss in the marginal density of S of the\nelements i , j during the first one of the successive measurement processes [52].\nApart from having been truncated, the final density operator (1.2) of S + A for the whole set E of runs displays an\nessential feature, the complete correlation between the indication Ai of the pointer and the state |si i of S. We will term\nas “registration” the establishment of these correlations. If they are produced, we can ascertain that, if the pointer\ntakes a well defined value Ai in some run, its observation will imply that ŝ takes with certainty the corresponding\neigenvalue si at the end of this run. Sorting the runs according to the outcome Ai allows us to split the ensemble E into\nsubensemble Ei , each one labelled by i and described by the state |si i|Ai i6 . Selection of the subensemble Ei by filtering\nthe values Ai therefore allows us to set S into this subensemble Ei described by the density operator |si i|Ai i∠Ai |hsi |. It\nis then possible to sort the runs according to the indication Ai of the pointer. Selecting thus the sub ensemble Ei by\nfiltering Ai allows us to set S into the given state |si i with a view to future experiments on S. An ideal measurement\nfollowed by filtering can therefore be used as a preparation of the state of S [53]. We will make the argument more\nprecise in § 10.2.2 and § 11.3.3.\nNote that some authors call “measurement” a single run of the experiment, or a repeated experiment in which the\noccurrence of some given eigenvalue of ŝ is detected, and in which only the corresponding events are selected for the\noutcoming system S. Here we use the term “measurement” to designate a repeated experiment performed on a large\nensemble of identically prepared systems which informs us about all possible values si of the observable ŝ of S, and\nthe term “ideal measurement” if the process perturbs S as little as allowed by quantum mechanics, in the sense that\nit does not affect the statistics of the observables that commute with ŝ. We do not regard the sorting as part of the\nmeasurement, but as a subsequent operation, and prefer to reserve the word “preparation through measurement” to\nsuch processes including a selection.\n1.2. The need for quantum statistical mechanics\nOm een paardendief te vangen heb je een paardendief nodig7\nUn coupable en cache un autre8\nDutch and French proverbs\nWe wish for consistency to use quantum mechanics for treating the dynamics of the interaction process between\nthe apparatus and the tested system. However, the apparatus must be a macroscopic object in order to allow the\noutcome to be read off from the final position of its pointer. The natural framework to reconcile these requirements is\nnon-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics, and not quantum mechanics of pure states as presented above. It will\nappear that not only the registration process can be addressed in this way, but also the truncation and the reduction.\n1.2.1. Irreversibility of measurement processes\nThe first time ever I saw your face\nI thought the sun rose in your eyes\nWritten by Ewan MacColl, sung by Roberta Flack\nAmong the features that we wish to explain, the truncation compels us to describe states by means of density\noperators. The sole use of pure states (quantum states describable by a wave function or a ket), is prohibited by\nthe form of (1.2), which is in general a statistical mixture. Even if we start from a pure state |ψi |0i, we must end\nup with the truncated mixed state (1.2) through an irreversible process. This irreversibility is also exhibited by the\nfact the same final state (1.2) is reached if one starts from different initial states of the form (1.1) deduced from one\n7 To catch a horse thief, you need a horse thief\n8 One culprit hides another\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n12\n\nanother through changes of the phases of the coefficients ψi . Such a feature is associated with the disappearance of\nthe specifically quantum correlations between S and A described by the off-diagonal terms of (1.3).\nActually, there is a second cause of irreversibility in any effective measurement process. The apparatus A should\nregister the result Ai in a robust and permanent way, so that it can be read off by any observer. Such a registration,\nwhich is often overlooked in the literature on measurements, is needed for practical reasons especially since we\nwish to explore microscopic objects. Moreover, its very existence allows us to disregard the observers in quantum\nmeasurements. Once the measurement has been registered, the result becomes objective and can be read off at any time\nby any observer. It can also be processed automatically, without being read off. Registration requires an amplification\nwithin the apparatus of a signal produced by interaction with the microscopic system S. For instance, in a bubble\nchamber, the apparatus in its initial state involves a liquid, overheated in a metastable phase. In spite of the weakness\nof the interaction between the particle to be detected and this liquid, amplification and registration of its track can\nbe achieved owing to local transition towards the stable gaseous phase. This stage of the measurement process thus\nrequires an irreversible phenomenon. It is governed by the kinetics of bubble formation under the influence of the\nparticle and implies a dumping of free energy. Similar remarks hold for photographic plates, photomultipliers and\nother types of detectors.\nSince the amplification and the registration of the measurement results require the apparatus A to be a large object\nso as to behave irreversibly, we must use quantum statistical mechanics to describe A. In particular, the above assumption that A lay initially in a pure state |0i was unrealistic – nevertheless this assumption is frequent in theoretical\nworks on measurements, see e.g. [25, 32, 33]. Indeed, preparing an object in a pure state requires controlling a\ncomplete set of commuting observables, performing their measurement and selecting the outcome (§ 1.1.3). While\nsuch operations are feasible for a few variables, they cannot be carried out for a macroscopic apparatus nor even for\na mesoscopic apparatus involving, say, 1000 particles. What the experimentalist does in a quantum measurement is\nquite the opposite [10, 11, 3, 31]: rather than purifying the initial state of A, he lets it stabilize macroscopically by\ncontrolling a few collective parameters such as the temperature of the apparatus. The adequate theoretical representation of the initial state of A, which is a mixed state, is therefore a density operator denoted as R̂(0). Using pure\nstates in thought experiments or models would require averaging so as to reproduce the actual situation (§ 10.2.3 and\n§ 12.1.4). Moreover the initial state of A should be metastable, which requires a sudden change of, e.g., temperature.\nLikewise the final possible stable marginal states of A are not pure. As we know from quantum statistical physics,\neach of them, characterized by the value of the pointer variable Ai that will be observed, should again be described\nby means of a density operator R̂i , and not by means of pure states |Ai i as in (1.3). Indeed, the number of state\nvectors associated with a sharp value of the macroscopic pointer variable Ai is huge for any actual measurement: As\nalways for large systems, we must allow for small fluctuations, negligible in relative value, around the mean value\nAi = trA ÂR̂i . The fact that the possible final states R̂i are exclusive is expressed by trA R̂i R̂ j ' 0 for j , i, which\nimplies\nR̂i R̂ j → 0\n\nfor N → ∞ when i , j.\n\n(1.4)\n\nIn words, these macroscopic pointer states are practically orthogonal.\n1.2.2. The paradox of irreversibility\nLa vida es sueño9\nCalderón de la Barca\nIf we disregard the system S, the irreversible process leading A from the initial state R̂ (0) to one among the final\nstates R̂i is reminiscent of relaxation processes in statistical physics, and the measurement problem raises the same\ntype of puzzle as the paradox of irreversibility. In all problems of statistical mechanics, the evolution is governed at\nthe microscopic level by equations that are invariant under time-reversal: Hamilton or Liouville equations in classical\nphysics, Schrödinger, or Liouville–von Neumann equations in quantum physics. Such equations are reversible and\nconserve the von Neumann entropy, which measures our missing information. Nevertheless we observe at our scale\nan irreversibility, measured by an increase of macroscopic entropy. The explanation of this paradox, see, e.g., [54,\n9 Life is a dream\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n13\n\n55, 56, 57, 58, 59], relies on the large number of microscopic degrees of freedom of thermodynamic systems, on\nstatistical considerations and on plausible assumptions about the dynamics and about the initial state of the system.\nLet us illustrate these ideas by recalling the historic example of a classical gas, for which the elucidation of the\nparadox was initiated by Boltzmann [54, 55, 56]. The microscopic state of a set of N structureless particles enclosed\nin a vessel is represented at each time by a point ξ(t) in the 6N-dimensional phase space, the trajectory of which is\ngenerated by Hamilton’s equations, the energy E being conserved. We have to understand why, starting at the time\nt = 0 from a more or less arbitrary initial state with energy E, we always observe that the gas reaches at the final time\ntf a state which macroscopically has the equilibrium properties associated with N and E, to wit, homogeneity and\nMaxwellian distribution of momenta – whereas a converse transformation is never seen in spite of the reversibility\nof the dynamics. As we are not interested in a single individual process but in generic features, we can resort to\nstatistical considerations. We therefore consider an initial macroscopic state Sinit characterized by given values of the\n(non uniform) densities of particles, of energy, and of momentum in ordinary space. Microscopically, Sinit can be\nrealized by any point ξinit lying in some volume Ωinit of phase space. On the other hand, consider the volume ΩE in\nphase space characterized by the total energy E. A crucial fact is that the immense majority of points ξ with energy\nE have macroscopically the equilibrium properties (homogeneity and Maxwellian distribution): the volume Ωeq of\nphase space associated with equilibrium occupies nearly the whole volume Ωeq /ΩE ' 1. Moreover, the volume ΩE\nis enormously larger than Ωinit . We understand these properties by noting that the phase space volumes characterized\nby some macroscopic property are proportional to the exponential of the thermodynamic entropy. In particular, the\nratio Ωeq /Ωinit is the exponential of the increase of entropy from Sinit to Seq , which is large as N. We note then that\nHamiltonian dynamics implies Liouville’s theorem. The bunch of trajectories issued from the points ξ(0) in Ωinit\ntherefore reach at the time tf a final volume Ωf = Ωinit that occupies only a tiny part of ΩE , but which otherwise is\nexpected to have nothing special owing to the complexity of the dynamics of collisions. Thus most end points ξ(tf )\nof these trajectories are expected to be typical points of ΩE , that is, to lie in the equilibrium region Ωeq . Conversely,\nstarting from an arbitrary point of ΩE or of Ωeq , the probability of reaching a point that differs macroscopically\nfrom equilibrium is extremely small, since such points occupy a negligible volume in phase space compared to the\nequilibrium points. The inconceivably large value of Poincaré’s recurrence time is also related to this geometry of\nphase space associated with the macroscopic size of the system.\nThe above argument has been made rigorous [54, 55, 56] by merging the dynamics and the statistics, that is,\nby studying the evolution of the density in phase space, the probability distribution which encompasses the bunch of\ntrajectories evoked above. Indeed, it is easier to control theoretically the Liouville equation than to study the individual\nHamiltonian trajectories and their statistics for random initial conditions. The initial state of the gas is now described\nby a non-equilibrium density in the 6N-dimensional phase space. Our full information about this initial state, or the\nfull order contained in it, is conserved by the microscopic evolution owing to the Liouville theorem. However, the\nsuccessive collisions produce correlations between larger and larger numbers of particles. Thus, while after some\ntime the gas reaches at the macroscopic scale the features of thermodynamic equilibrium, the initial order gets hidden\ninto microscopic variables, namely many-particle correlations, that are inaccessible. Because the number of degrees of\nfreedom is large – and it is actually gigantic for any macroscopic object – this order cannot be retrieved (except in some\nexceptional controlled dynamical phenomena such as spin echoes [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65]). In any real situation, it is\ntherefore impossible to recover, for instance, a non-uniform density from the very complicated correlations created\nduring the relaxation process. For all practical purposes, we can safely keep track, even theoretically, only of the\ncorrelations between a number of particles small compared to the total number of particles of the system: the exact\nfinal density in phase space cannot then be distinguished from a thermodynamic equilibrium distribution. It is this\ndropping of information about undetectable and ineffective degrees of freedom, impossible to describe even with the\nlargest computers, which raises the macroscopic entropy [54, 55, 56, 57, 58]. Such approximations can be justified\nmathematically through limiting processes where N → ∞.\nAltogether, irreversibility can be derived rigorously for the Boltzmann gas under assumptions of smoothness and\napproximate factorization of the single particle density. The change of scale modifies qualitatively the properties of\nthe dynamics, for all accessible times and for all accessible physical variables. The emergence of an irreversible\nrelaxation from the reversible microscopic dynamics is a statistical phenomenon which becomes nearly deterministic\nowing to the large number of particles. We shall encounter similar features in quantum measurement processes.\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n14\n\n1.2.3. Quantum measurements in the language of statistical physics\nNow the whole earth was of one language and of one speech10\nGenesis 11:1\nThe theoretical description of a measurement process should be inspired by the above ideas. Actually, a measurement process looks like a relaxation process, but with several complications. On the one hand, the final stable state of\nA is not unique, and the dynamical process can have several possible outcomes for A. In photodetection (the eye, a\nphotomultiplier), one just detects whether an avalanche has or not been created by the arrival of a photon. In a magnetic dot, one detects the direction of the magnetization. The apparatus is therefore comparable to a material which,\nin statistical physics, has a broken invariance and can relax towards one equilibrium phase or another, starting from\na single metastable phase. On the other hand, the evolution of A towards one among the final states R̂i characterized\nby the variable Ai should be triggered by interaction with S, in a way depending on the initial microscopic state of S\nand, for an ideal measurement, the final microscopic state of S should be correlated to the outcome Ai . Thus, contrary\nto theories of standard relaxation processes in statistical physics, the theory of a measurement process will require a\nsimultaneous control of microscopic and macroscopic variables. In the coupled evolution of A and S which involves\ntruncation and registration, coarse graining will be adequate for A, becoming exact in the limit of a large A, but not\nfor S. Moreover the final state of S + A keeps memory of the initial state of S, at least partly. The very essence of a\nmeasurement lies in this feature, whereas memory effects are rarely considered in standard relaxation processes.\nDenoting by r̂ (0) and R̂(0) the density operators of the system S and the apparatus A, respectively, before the\nmeasurement, the initial state of S + A is characterized in the language of quantum statistical mechanics by the density\noperator\nD̂ (0) = r̂ (0) ⊗ R̂ (0) .\n(1.5)\nIn the Schrödinger picture, where the wave functions evolve according to the Schrödinger equation while observables\nare time-independent, the density operator D̂(t) = exp(−iĤt/~)D̂(0) exp(iĤt/~) of the compound system S + A\nevolves according to the Liouville-von Neumann equation of motion\ndD̂\n= [Ĥ, D̂] ≡ Ĥ D̂ − D̂Ĥ,\n(1.6)\ndt\nwhere Ĥ is the Hamiltonian of S + A including the interaction between S and A. By solving (1.6) with the initial\ncondition (1.5), we find the expectation value hÂ(t)i of any observable Â of S + A at the time t as tr[D̂(t)Â] (see\nsubsection 10.1 and Appendix G).\nWe first wish to show that, for an ideal measurement, the final density operator of S + A which represents the\noutcome af a large set E of runs at the time tf has the form\nX\u0010\nX\n\u0011\nD̂ (tf ) =\nΠ̂i r̂ (0) Π̂i ⊗ R̂i =\npi r̂i ⊗ R̂i ,\n(1.7)\ni~\n\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere Π̂i denotes the projection operator (satisfying Π̂i Π̂ j = δi j Π̂i ) on the eigenspace si of ŝ in the Hilbert space of S,\nP\nP\nwith ŝ = i si Π̂i and i Π̂i = Î. (If the eigenvalue si is non-degenerate, Π̂i is simply equal to |si ihsi |.) We have denoted\nby\nr̂i =\n\n1\nΠ̂i r̂(0)Π̂i\npi\n\n(1.8)\n\n10 Metaphorically, the discovery of quantum theory and the lack of agreement about its interpretation may be phrased in Genesis 11 [66]:\n1. Now the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. 2. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plane\nin the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. 3. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had\nbrick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. 4. And they said, Go to, let us build a city, and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven; and let\nus make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. 5. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which\nthe children of men builded. 6. And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now\nnothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. 7. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may\nnot understand one another’s speech. 8. So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the\ncity. 9. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord\nscatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n15\n\nthe corresponding normalized projected state (which reduces to |si ihsi | if si is non-degenerate), and by\npi ≡ trS r̂(0)Π̂i\n\n(1.9)\n\nthe normalizing factor (which reduces to rii (0) if si is non-degenerate). The expression (1.7) generalizes (1.2) to\narbitrary density operators; we will use the same vocabulary as in § 1.1.2 to designate its various features. This\ngeneralization was first conceived by Lüders [67]. The lack in (1.7) of off-diagonal blocks i , j in a basis where ŝ\nis diagonal expresses truncation. The correlations between the states r̂i for S and the states R̂i for A, displayed in its\ndiagonal blocks, express registration; they are encoded in hΠ̂i (Â − Ai )2 i = 0 for each i, a consequence of (1.7), which\nmeans that in an ideal measurement ŝ takes the value si when Â takes the value Ai .\nWe further wish to show that reduction takes place, i.e., that the pointer takes for each run a well-defined value\nAi and that the set E of runs can unambiguously be split into subsets Ei including a proportion pi of runs, in such a\nway that for each subset Ei , characterized by the outcome Ai , the final state of S + A is D̂i = r̂i ⊗ R̂i . This property\nobviously requires that (1.7) is satisfied, since by putting back together the subensembles Ei we recover for E the\nP\nstate i pi D̂i of S + A. Nevertheless, due to a quantum queerness (§ 10.2.3), we cannot conversely infer from the\nlatter state the existence of physical subensembles Ei described by the reduced states D̂i . In fact, the very selection\nof some specific outcome labelled by the index i requires the reading of the indication Ai of the pointer (§ 1.1.3), but\nit is not granted from (1.7) that each run provides such a well-defined indication. This problem will be exemplified\nby the Curie–Weiss model and solved in section 11. We will rely on a property of arbitrary subsets of runs of the\nmeasurement, their hierarchic structure. Namely, any subset must be described at the final time by a density operator\nP\nof the form i qi D̂i with arbitrary weights qi . This property, which is implied by reduction, cannot be deduced from\nthe sole knowledge of the density operator (1.7) that describes the final state of S + A for the full set E of runs.\nTracing out the apparatus from (1.7) provides the marginal state for the tested system S after measurement, which\nis represented for the whole set of runs by the density operator\nr̂ (tf ) ≡ trA D̂(tf ) =\n\nX\n\npi r̂i =\n\ni\n\nX\ni\n\nΠ̂i r̂(0)Π̂i =\n\nX\n\npi |si ihsi | =\n\nX\n\nrii (0)|si ihsi |.\n\n(1.10)\n\ni\n\ni\n\nThe last two expressions in (1.10) hold when the eigenvalues si of ŝ are non-degenerate. Symmetrically, the final\nmarginal state of the apparatus\nX\npi R̂i\n(1.11)\nR̂ (tf ) = trS D̂(tf ) =\ni\n\nis consistent with the occurrence with a probability pi of its indication Ai . The expression (1.10) is the result of weak\ntruncation, while the selection of the runs characterized by the outcome Ai produces for S the weak reduction into the\nstate r̂i . The latter process constitutes a preparation of S. As already noted in § 1.1.2, the fact that simply tracing out\nA may lead to a (weakly) truncated or a reduced state for S solves in no way the physics of the measurement process,\na well known weakness of some models [10, 11, 31, 68, 69].\n1.2.4. Entropy changes in a measurement\nDiscussions about entropy have produced quite some heat\nAnonymous\nWhen von Neumann set up in 1932 the formalism of quantum statistical mechanics [4], he introduced density\noperators D̂ as quantum analogues of probability distributions, and he associated with any of them a number, its\nentropy S [D̂] = −tr D̂ ln D̂. In case D̂ describes a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, S [D̂] is identified with\nthe entropy of thermodynamics11 . Inspired by these ideas, Shannon founded in 1948 the theory of communication,\n11 With this definition, S is dimensionless. In thermodynamic units, S is obtained by multiplying its present expression by Boltzmann’s constant\n\n1.38 · 10−23 JK−1 . Likewise, if we wish to express Shannon’s entropy in bits, its expression should be divided by ln 2\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n16\n\nwhich relies on a quantitative estimate of the amount of information carried by a message [70]. Among the various\npossible messages that are expected to be emitted, each one i has some probability pi to occur; by receiving the specific\nP\nmessage i we gain an amount − ln pi of information. Shannon’s entropy S [p] = − i pi ln pi characterizes the average\namount of information which is missing when the message has not yet been acknowledged. Returning to quantum\nmechanics, a new interpretation of von Neumann’s entropy is thus obtained [71, 72, 73]. When a system (or rather\na statistical ensemble of systems prepared under similar conditions, in which the considered system is embedded) is\ndescribed by some density operator D̂, the associated von Neumann entropy can be regarded as an extension of the\nShannon entropy: it characterizes a lack of information due to the probabilistic description of the system. It has thus a\npartly subjective nature, since it measures our uncertainty. One can also identify it with disorder [58, 72, 73, 74, 75].\nAs measurement processes are means for gathering information, quantitative estimates of the amounts of information\ninvolved are provided by the changes of the von Neumann entropies of the systems S, A and S + A. We gather below\nthe various results found in the literature and their interpretation.\nThe equation of motion of S + A is deterministic and reversible, and some manipulations justified by the large\nsize of A are necessary, as in any relaxation problem, to understand how the state of S + A may end as (1.7). Strictly\nspeaking, the Liouville-von Neumann evolution (1.6) conserves the von Neumann entropy −tr D̂ ln D̂ associated with\nthe whole set of degrees of freedom of S + A; in principle no information is lost. However, in statistical physics,\nirreversibility means that information (identified with order) is transferred towards inaccessible degrees of freedom,\nin the form of many-particle correlations, without possibility of return in a reasonable delay. A measure of this loss\nof information is provided by the “relevant entropy” [58, 72, 73, 74, 75], which is the von Neumann entropy of the\nstate that results from the elimination of the information about such inaccessible correlations. Here the truncated state\nD̂(tf ) should have the latter status: As regards all accessible degrees of freedom, D̂(tf ) should be equivalent to the state\nissued from D̂(0) through the equation of motion (1.6), but we got rid in D̂(tf ) of the irrelevant correlations involving\na very large number of elements of the macroscopic apparatus A; such correlations are irremediably lost.\nWe can therefore measure the irreversibility of the measurement process leading from D̂(0) to D̂(tf ) by the following entropy balance. The von Neumann entropy of the initial state (1.5) is split into contributions from S and A,\nrespectively, as\nh\ni\nh\ni\nS D̂ (0) = −tr D̂ (0) ln D̂ (0) = S S [r̂ (0)] + S A R̂ (0) ,\n(1.12)\nwhereas that of the final state (1.7) is\nX\nh i\nh\ni\nS D̂ (tf ) = S S [r̂ (tf )] +\npi S A R̂i ,\n\n(1.13)\n\ni\n\nwhere r̂ (tf ) is the marginal state (1.10) of S at the final time12 . This equality entails separate contributions from S and\nA. The increase of entropy from (1.12) to (1.13) clearly arises from the two above-mentioned reasons, truncation and\nregistration. On the one hand, when the density operator r̂ (0) involves off-diagonal blocks Π̂i r̂ (0) Π̂ j (i , j), their\ntruncation raises the entropy. On the other hand, a robust registration requires that the possible final states R̂i of A are\nmore stable than the initial state R̂ (0), so that their entropy is larger. The latter effect dominates because the apparatus\nis large, typically S A will be macroscopic and S S microscopic.\nWe can see that the state D̂(tf ) expected to be reached at the end of the process is the one which maximizes von\nNeumann’s entropy under the constraints imposed by the conservation laws (§ 10.2.2). The conserved quantities are\nthe energy hĤi (where Ĥ = ĤS + ĤA − ŝ Â includes the coupling of the tested quantity ŝ with the pointer observable Â)\nand the expectation values of all the observables Ôk of S that commute with ŝ (we assume not only [ĤS , ŝ] = 0 but also\nP\n[ĤS , Ôk ] = 0, see [13, 76]. This maximization of entropy yields a density matrix proportional to exp(−βĤ − k λk Ôk ),\nwhich has the form of a sum of diagonal blocks i, each of which factorizes as pi r̂i ⊗ R̂i . The first factor pi r̂i associated\nwith S, obtained by adjusting the Lagrangian multipliers λk , is identified with (1.8), due to the conservation of the\ndiagonal blocks of the marginal density matrix of S. The second factor R̂i associated with A is then proportional to\n12 The latter expression is found by using the orthogonality R̂ R̂ = 0 for i , j, so that −D̂(t ) ln D̂(t ) is equal to the sum of its separate blocks,\ni j\nf\nf\n\nP\n\nln pi − ln r̂i − ln R̂i ), and hence the entropy of D̂(tf ) is a sum of contributions arising from each i. The trace over A of the first two\ni pi r̂i ⊗ R̂i (−P\nterms leads to i pi r̂i (− ln pi − ln r̂i ), the trace over S of which may be identified with the entropy S S [r̂(tf )] of (1.10); the trace of the last term leads\nto the last sum in (1.13)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n17\n\nexp[−β(ĤA − si Â)], a density operator which for a macroscopic apparatus A describes one of its equilibrium states\ncharacterized by the value Ai of the pointer. Thus, the study of the evolution of S + A for a large statistical ensemble of\nruns (sections 4 to 7 for the Curie–Weiss model) should amount to justify dynamically the maximum entropy criterion\nof equilibrium statistical mechanics. A further dynamical study is, however, required in quantum mechanics to justify\nthe assignment of one among the terms r̂i ⊗ R̂i of (1.7) to the outcome of an individual run (section 11 for the Curie–\nWeiss model).\nAn apparatus is a device which allows us to gain some information on the state of S by reading the outcomes Ai .\nThe price we have to pay for being thus able to determine the probabilities (1.9) is a complete loss of information\nabout the off-diagonal elements Π̂i r̂ (0) Π̂ j (i , j) of the initial state of S13 , and a rise in the thermodynamic entropy\nof the apparatus. More generally, in other types of quantum measurements, some information about a system may be\ngained only at the expense of erasing other information about this system [77] (see subsection 2.5).\nThe quantitative estimation of the gains and losses of information in the measurement process is provided by an\nentropic analysis, reviewed in [22, 72, 78]. Applications of entropy for quantifying the uncertainties in quantum\nmeasurements are also discussed in [79]. We recall here the properties of the entropy of the marginal state of S and\ntheir interpretation in terms of information. We have just noted that S S [r̂ (tf )] − S S [r̂ (0)], which is non-negative,\nmeasures the increase of entropy of S due to weak truncation. This means that, in case we know r̂(0), the interaction\nwith A (without reading the pointer) lets us loose the amount of information S S [r̂ (tf )]−S S [r̂ (0)] about all observables\nthat do not commute with ŝ [72, 78]. In fact, this loss is the largest possible among the set of states that preserve\nthe whole information about the observables commuting with ŝ. Any state of S that provides, for all observables\ncommuting with ŝ, the same expectation values as r̂(tf ) is less disordered than r̂(tf ), and has an entropy lower than\nS S [r̂(tf )]. In other words, among all the processes that leave the statistics of the observables commuting with ŝ\nunchanged, the ideal measurement of ŝ is the one which destroys the largest amount of information (about the other\nobservables of S).\nReading the pointer value Ai , which occurs with probability pi , allows us to ascertain (for the considered ideal\nmeasurement) that S is in the state r̂i after the measurement. By acknowledging the outcomes of a large sequence\nof runs of the measurement, we gain therefore on average some amount of information given on the one hand by the\nP\nShannon entropy − i pi ln pi , and equal on the other hand to the difference between the entropies of the final state\nand of its separate components,\nS S [r̂(tf )] −\n\nX\n\npi S S [r̂i ] = −\n\nX\n\ni\n\npi ln pi ≥ 0.\n\n(1.14)\n\ni\n\nThe equality expresses additivity of information, or of uncertainty, at the end of the process, when we have not yet read\nthe outcomes Ai : Our uncertainty S S [r̂(tf )], when we know directly that r̂(tf ), the density operator of the final state,\nencompasses all possible marginal final states r̂i , each with its probability pi , is given by the left-hand side of (1.14).\nIt is the same as if we proceed in two steps. As we have not yet read Ai , we have a total uncertainty S S [r̂(tf )] because\nP\nwe miss the corresponding amount of Shannon information − i pi ln pi about the outcomes; and we miss also, with\nthe probability pi for each possible occurrence of Ai , some information on S equal to S S [r̂i ], the entropy of the state\nr̂i . As it stands, the equality (1.14) also expresses the equivalence between negentropy and information [74, 80, 81]:\nsorting the ensemble of systems S according to the outcome i lowers the entropy by a quantity equal on average to\nthe left-hand side of (1.14), while reading the indication Ai of the pointer provides, in Shannon’s sense, an additional\namount of information − ln pi , on average equal to the right-hand side.\nTwo inequalities are satisfied in the whole process, including the sorting of results:\n−\n\nX\ni\n\npi ln pi ≥ S S [r̂(0)] −\n\nX\n\npi S S [r̂i ] ≥ 0.\n\n(1.15)\n\ni\n\nThe first inequality expresses that the additivity of the information gained on the final state r̂(tf ) of S by acknowledging\nthe probabilities pi , as expressed by (1.14), is spoiled in quantum mechanics when one considers the whole process,\n13 In the language of section 1.1: Loss of information about the phases of the ψ\ni\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n18\n\ndue to the quantum perturbation of the initial state of S which eliminates its off diagonal sectors. The second inequality,\nderived in [82], expresses that measurements yield a positive balance of information about S in spite of the losses\nresulting from the perturbation of S. Indeed, this inequality means that, on average over many runs of the measurement\nprocess, and after sorting of the outcomes, the entropy of S has decreased, i. e., more information on S is available at\nthe time tf than at the initial time. The equality holds only if all possible final states r̂i of S have the same entropy.\nNote finally that, if we wish to perform repeated quantum measurements in a closed cycle, we must reset the\napparatus in its original metastable state. As for a thermal machine, this requires lowering the entropy and costs some\nsupply of energy.\n1.3. Towards a solution of the measurement problem?\n. 14\n\nRussian proverb\nThe quantum measurement problem arises from the acknowledgement that individual measurements provide welldefined outcomes. Standard quantum mechanics yields only probabilistic results and thus seems unable to explain such\na behavior. We have advocated above the use of quantum statistical physics, which seems even less adapted to draw\nconclusions about individual systems. Most of the present work will be devoted to show how a statistical approach\nmay nevertheless solve the measurement problem as will be discussed in section 11. We begin with a brief survey of\nthe more current approaches.\n1.3.1. Various approaches\nНам нужен плюрализм, тут двух мений\nбыть не может.\n\n15\n\nMikhail Gorbachev\nIn the early days of quantum mechanics, the apparatus was supposed to behave classically, escaping the realm\nof quantum theory [83, 84, 85]. A similar idea survives in theoretical or experimental works exploring the possible\nexistence of a border between small or large, or between simple and complex objects, which would separate the\ndomains of validity of quantum and classical physics (Heisenberg’s cut [3]).\nAnother current viewpoint has attributed the reduction16 in a measurement to the “act of observing the result”.\nAgain, the observer himself, who is exterior to the system, is not described in the framework of quantum mechanics. In\nRovelli’s relational interpretation [86] a quantum mechanical description of some object is regarded as a codification of\nits properties which is “observer-dependent”, that is, relative to a particular apparatus. Then, while a first “observer” A\nwho gathers information about S regards reduction as real, a second observer testing S + A can consider that reduction\nhas not taken place. In the many-worlds interpretation, reduction is even denied, and regarded as a delusion due to the\nlimitations of the human mind [25, 26]. From another angle, people who wish to apply quantum theory to the whole\nuniverse, even have a non-trivial task in defining what is observation. A more rational attitude is taken within the\nconsistent histories approach, in which one is careful with defining when and where the events happen, but in which\none holds that the measurements simply reveal the pre-existing values of events (this approach is discussed below in\nsection 2.9). For interpretations of quantum mechanics, see Bohm’s textbook [87] and for interpretations based on\nentanglement and information, see Peres [22] and Jaeger [88].\nThe reduction may be regarded as a bifurcation in the evolution of the considered system, which may end up\nin different possible states |si i although it has been prepared in the single initial state |ψi. In the de Broglie–Bohm\ninterpretation involving both waves and classical-like trajectories, the wave function |ψ(t)i appears both as arising\nfrom the density of trajectories and as guiding their dynamics. The randomness of quantum mechanics then arises\nmerely from a randomness in the initial points of the set of trajectories. During a measurement process, the single\n14 Visiting is good, but home is better\n15 We need pluralism, there cannot be two opinions on that\n16 In order to distinguish two concepts often used in the literature, we use the word “reduction” as meaning the transformation of the initial state\nof S + A into the final reduced state associated with one or another single run of the measurement, as specified in § 1.1.2, although the same word\nis often used in the literature to designate what we call “truncation” (decay of off-diagonal elements of the density matrix)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n19\n\ninitial bundle of trajectories, associated with |ψi, is split into separate bundles, each of which is associated with a wave\nfunction |si i. While this interpretation accounts for the bifurcation and for the uniqueness of the outcome of each run\nof a measurement process, it is not widely accepted [18, 19, 24, 35, 89].\nA more recent line of thought, going “beyond the quantum” [20] relies on modification of the Schrödinger\nmechanics by additional non-linear and stochastic terms; see Refs. [17, 90, 91] for review. Such generalizations are\nbased in the belief, emphasized in the standard Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, that the Schrödinger\nequation is unable to describe the joint evolution of a system S and an apparatus A, so that a special separate postulate\nis needed to account for the rules of quantum measurements, in particular reduction. Indeed, a hamiltonian evolution\nseems to preclude the emergence of a single result in each single realization of a measurement [4, 13, 30].\nWe will focus below on the most conservative approach where S + A is treated as an isolated quantum object\ngoverned by a Hamiltonian, and yet where reduction can be understood. The measurement is not considered on formal\nand general grounds as in many conceptual works aimed mainly at the interpretation of quantum mechanics, but it\nis fully analyzed as a dynamical process. Unfortunately the theory of specific experimental measurement processes\nbased on hamiltonian dynamics is made difficult by the complexity of a real measuring apparatus. One can gain full\ninsight only by solving models that mimic actual measurements. The formal issue is first to show how S + A, which\nstarts from the state (1.5) and evolves along (1.6), may reach a final state of the truncated and correlated form (1.7),\nthen to explain how dynamics may provide for each run of the experiment one among the reduced states D̂i .\nThe realization of such a program should meet the major challenge raised long ago by Bell [92]: “So long as\nthe wave packet reduction is an essential component, and so long as we do not know exactly when and how it takes\nover from the Schrödinger equation, we do not have an exact and unambiguous formulation of our most fundamental\nphysical theory”. Indeed, a full understanding of quantum mechanics requires knowledge of the time scales involved\nin measurements.\nKnowing how the truncation, then the reduction proceed in time, how long they take, is a prerequisite for clearing\nup the meaning of this phenomenon. On the other hand, the registration is part of the measurement; it is important\nto exhibit the time scale on which it takes place, to determine whether it interferes with the reduction or not, and to\nknow when and how the correlations between S and A are established. These are the tasks we undertake in the body\nof this work on a specific but flexible model. We resume in sections 9 and 11 how the solution of this model answers\nsuch questions.\n1.3.2. Glossary: Definition of the basic terms used throughout\nEvery word has three definitions\nand three interpretations\nCosta Rican proverb\nAuthors do not always assign the same meaning to some current words. In order to avoid misunderstandings, we\ngather here the definitions that we are using throughout.\n• Observable: an operator that represents a physical quantity of a system (§ 10.1.1).\n• Statistical ensemble: a real or virtual set of systems prepared under identical conditions (§ 10.1.3).\n• Subsensemble: part of an ensemble, itself regarded as a statistical ensemble.\n• Quantum state: a mathematical object from which all the probabilistic properties of a statistical ensemble –\nor subensemble – of systems can be obtained. (Strictly speaking, the state of an individual system refers to\na thought ensemble in which it is embedded, since this state has a probabilistic nature.) States are generally\nrepresented by a density operator (or, in a given basis, a density matrix) which encompasses the expectation\nvalues of all the observables. Pure states are characterized by an absence of statistical fluctuations for some\ncomplete set of commuting observables (§ 10.1.4).\n• Measurement: a dynamical process which involves an apparatus A coupled to a tested system S and which\nprovides information about one observable ŝ of S. The time-dependent state of the compound system S + A\ndescribes a statistical ensemble of runs, not individual runs. With this definition, the reading of the outcomes\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n20\n\nand the selection of the results are not encompassed in the “measurement”, nor in the “truncation” and the\n“registration”.\n• Individual run of a measurement: a single interaction process between tested system and apparatus (prepared\nin a metastable state), followed by the reading of the outcome.\n• Ideal measurement: a measurement which does not perturb the observables of S that commute with ŝ.\n• Pointer; pointer variable: a part of the apparatus which undergoes a change that can be read off or registered.\nIn general the pointer should be macroscopic and the pointer variable should be collective.\n• Truncation; disappearance of Schrödinger cat states: the disappearance, at the end of the measurement process,\nof the off-diagonal blocks of the density matrix of S + A describing the whole set of runs, in a basis where ŝ is\ndiagonal17,18 (sections 5 and 6).\n• Dephasing: the decay of a sum of many oscillatory terms with different frequencies, arising from their mutual\nprogressive interference in absence of a relevant coupling to an environment19 .\n• Decoherence: in general, a decay of the off-diagonal blocks of a density matrix under the effect of a random\nenvironment, such as a thermal bath.\n• Registration: the creation during a measurement of correlations between S and the macroscopic pointer of A.\nInformation is thus transferred to the apparatus, but becomes available only if uniqueness of the indication of\nthe pointer is ensured for individual runs (section 7).\n• Reduction: for an individual run of the measurement, assignment of a state to S+A at the end of the process17,18 .\nReduction is the objectification step, which reveals properties of a tested individual object. It requires truncation,\nregistration, uniqueness of the indication of the pointer and selection of this outcome (§§ 11.3.1 and 11.3.2).\n• Selection: the sorting of the runs of an ideal measurement according to the indication of the pointer. The original\nensemble that underwent the process is thus split into subensembles characterized by a well-defined value of ŝ.\nMeasurement followed by selection may constitute a preparation (§ 10.2.2 and § 11.3.2).\n• Hierarchic structure of subensembles: a property required to solve the quantum measurement problem. Namely,\nthe final state associated with any subset of runs of the measurement should have the same form as for the whole\nset but with different weights (§ 11.2.1).\n• Subensemble relaxation: a dynamical process within the apparatus which leads the state of S + A to equilibrium,\nfor an arbitrary subensemble of runs (§§ 11.2.4 and 11.2.5).\n1.3.3. Outline\nDoorknob: Read the directions and directly\nyou will be directed in the right direction\n“Alice in Wonderland”, Walt Disney film\nWe review in section 2 the works that tackled the program sketched above, and discuss to which extent they\nsatisfy the various features that we stressed in the introduction. For instance, do they explain reduction by relying\non a full dynamical solution of the Liouville–von Neumann equation for the considered model, or do they only\ninvoke environment-induced decoherence? Do they solve the preferred basis paradox? Do they account for a robust\nregistration? Do they produce the time scales involved in the process?\n17 We will refrain from using popular terms such as “collapse of the wave function” or “reduction of the wave packet”\n18 We use the terms “weak truncation” and “weak reduction” for the same operations as truncation and reduction, but performed on the marginal\ndensity matrix of the tested system S, and not on the density matrix of the compound system S+A\n19 An example is the relaxation due to an inhomogeneous magnetic field in NMR\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n21\n\nIn section 3 we present the Curie–Weiss model, which encompasses many properties of the previous models and\non which we will focus afterwards. It is sufficiently simple to be completely solvable, sufficiently elaborate to account\nfor all characteristics of ideal quantum measurements, and sufficiently realistic to resemble actual experiments: The\napparatus simulates a magnetic dot, a standard registering device.\nThe detailed solution of the equations of motion that describe a large set E of runs for this model is worked out\nin sections 4 to 7, some calculations being given in appendices. After analyzing the equations of motion of S + A\n(section 4), we exhibit several time scales. The truncation rapidly takes place (section 5). It is then made irremediable\nowing to two alternative mechanisms (section 6). Amplification and registration require much longer delays since\nthey involve a macroscopic change of the apparatus and energy exchange with the bath (section 7).\nSolving several variants of the Curie–Weiss model allows us to explore various dynamical processes which can be\ninterpreted either as imperfect measurements or as failures (section 8). In particular, we study what happens when the\npointer has few degrees of freedom or when one tries to simultaneously measure non-commuting observables. The\ncalculations are less simple than for the original model, but are included in the text for completeness.\nThe results of sections 4 to 8 are resumed and analyzed in section 9, which also presents some simplified derivations suited for tutorial purposes. However, truncation and registration, explained in sections 5 to 7 for the Curie–\nWeiss model, are only prerequisites for elucidating the quantum measurement problem, which itself is needed to\nexplain reduction.\nBefore we tackle this remaining task, we need to make more precise the conceptual framework on which we rely,\nsince reduction is tightly related with the interpretation of quantum mechanics. The statistical interpretation (also\ncalled ensemble interpretation), in a form presented in section 10, appears as the most natural and consistent one in\nthis respect.\nWe are then in position to work out the occurrence of reduction within the framework of the statistical interpretation by analyzing arbitrary subsets of runs. This is achieved in section 11 for a modified Curie–Weiss model, in which\nvery weak but still sufficiently elaborate interactions within the apparatus are implemented. The uniqueness of the\nresult of a single measurement, as well as the occurrence of classical probabilities, are thus seen to emerge only from\nthe dynamics of the measurement process.\nLessons for future work are drawn in section 12, and some open problems are suggested in section 13.\nThe reader interested only in the results may skip the technical sections 4 to 8, and focus upon the first pages of\nsection 9, which can be regarded as a self-contained reading guide for them, and upon section 11. The conceptual\noutcomes are gathered in sections 10 and 12.\n2. The approach based on models\nPoint n’est besoin d’espérer pour entreprendre,\nni de réussir pour persévérer20\nCharles le Téméraire and William of Orange\nWe have briefly surveyed in § 1.3.1 many theoretical ideas intended to elucidate the problem of quantum measurements. In § 12.4.2 and § 12.4.3 we mention a few other ideas about this problem. However, we feel that it is\nmore appropriate to think along the lines of an experimentalist who performs measurements in his laboratory. For this\nreason, it is instructive to formulate and solve models within this scope. We review in this section various models in\nwhich S + A is treated as a compound system which evolves during the measurement process according to the standard rules of quantum mechanics. The existing models are roughly divided into related classes. Several models serve\nto elucidate open problems. Besides specific models, we shall discuss several more general approaches to quantum\nmeasurements (e.g., the decoherence and consistent histories approaches).\n\n20 It is not necessary to hope for undertaking, neither to succeed for persevering\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n22\n\n2.1. Heisenberg–von Neumann setup\nQuod licet Iovi, non licet bovi 21\nRoman proverb\nA general set-up of quantum measurement was proposed and analysed by Heisenberg [2, 3]. His ideas were\nformalized by von Neumann who proposed the very first mathematically rigorous model of quantum measurement\n[4]. An early review on this subject is by London and Bauer [30], in the sixties it was carefully reviewed by Wigner\n[13]; see [93] for a modern review.\nVon Neumann formulated the measurement process as a coupling between two quantum systems with a specific\ninteraction Hamiltonian that involves the (tensor) product between the measured observable of the tested system and\nthe pointer variable, an observable of the apparatus. This interaction conserves the measured observable and ensures a\ncorrelation between the tested quantity and the pointer observable. In one way or another the von Neumann interaction\nHamiltonian is applied in all subsequent models of ideal quantum measurements. However, von Neumannn’s model\ndoes not account for the differences between the microscopic [system] and macroscopic [apparatus] scales. As a main\nconsequence, it does not have a mechanism to ensure the specific classical correlations (in the final state of the system\n+ apparatus) necessary for the proper interpretation of a quantum measurement. Another drawback of this approach\nis its requirement for the initial state of the measuring system (the apparatus) to be a pure state (so it is described\nby a single wave function). Moreover, this should be a specific pure state, where fluctuations of the pointer variable\nare small. Both of these features are unrealistic. In addition, and most importantly, the von Neumann model does\nnot account for the features of truncation and reduction; it only shows weak reduction (see terminology in § 1.1.2\nand § 1.3.2). This fact led von Neumann (and later on Wigner [13]) to postulate – on top of the usual Schrödinger\nevolution – a specific dynamic process that is supposed to achieve the reduction [4].\nWith all these specific features it is not surprising that the von Neumann model has only one characteristic time\ndriven by the interaction Hamiltonian. Over this time the apparatus variable gets correlated with the initial state of the\nmeasured system.\nJauch considers the main problem of the original von Neumann model, i.e. that in the final state it does not ensure\nspecific classical correlations between the apparatus and the system [94]. A solution of this problem is attempted\nwithin the lines suggested (using his words) during “the heroic period of quantum mechanics”, that is, looking for\nclassical features of the apparatus. To this end, Jauch introduces the concept of equivalence between two states (as\nrepresented by density matrices): two states are equivalent with respect to a set of observables, if these observables\ncannot distinguish one of these states from another [94]. Next, he shows that for the von Neumann model there is a\nnatural set of commuting (hence classical) observables, so that with respect to this set the final state of the model is\nnot distinguishable from the one having the needed classical correlations. At the same time Jauch accepts that some\nother observable of the system and the apparatus can distinguish these states. Next, he makes an attempt to define\nthe measurement event via his concept of classical equivalence. In our opinion this attempt is interesting, but not\nsuccessful.\n2.2. Quantum–classical models: an open issue?\nGooi geen oude schoenen weg\nvoor je nieuwe hebt22\nDutch proverb\nFollowing suggestions of Bohr that the proper quantum measurement should imply a classical apparatus [83,\n84, 85], there were several attempts to work out interaction between a quantum and an explicitly classical system\n[95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109]. (Neither Bohr [83, 84], nor Landau and\nLifshitz [85] who present Bohr’s opinion in quite detail, consider the proper interaction processes.) This subject\nis referred to as hybrid (quantum–classical) dynamics. Besides the measurement theory it is supposed to apply in\nquantum chemistry [95, 96, 103] (where the full modeling of quantum degrees of freedom is difficult) and in quantum\n21 What is allowed for Jupiter, is not allowed for the rind\n22 Don’t throw away old shoes before you have new ones\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n23\n\ngravity [110], where the proper quantum dynamics of the gravitational field is not known. There are several versions\nof the hybrid dynamics. The situation, where the classical degree of freedom is of a mean-field type is especially\nwell-known [95, 96]. In that case the hybrid dynamics can be derived variationally from a simple combination of\nquantum and classical Lagrangian. More refined versions of the hybrid dynamics attempt to describe interactions\nbetween the classical degree(s) of freedom and quantum fluctuations. Such theories are supposed to be closed and\nself-consistent, and (if they really exist) they would somehow get the same fundamental status as their limiting cases,\ni.e., as quantum and classical mechanics. The numerous attempts to formulate such fundamental quantum–classical\ntheories have encountered severe difficulties [98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]. There are no–go theorems\nshowing in which specific sense such theories cannot exist [107, 108].\nAs far as the quantum measurement issues are concerned, the hybrid dynamical models have not received the\nattention they deserve. This is surprising, because Bohr’s insistence on the classicality of the apparatus is widely\nknown and frequently repeated. The existing works are summarized as follows. Diosi and co-authors stated that their\nscheme for the hybrid dynamics is useful for quantum measurements [98, 99], albeit that they did not come with\na more or less explicit analysis. Later on Terno has shown that the problem of a quantum measurement cannot be\nsolved via a certain class of hybrid dynamic systems [111]. His arguments rely on the fact that the majority of hybrid\nsystem have pathological features in one way or another. Terno also reviews some earlier attempts, in particular by\nhim in collaboration with Peres [106], to describe quantum measurements via hybrid dynamics; see the book of Peres\n[22] for preliminary ideas within this approach. However, recently Hall and Reginato [109, 112] suggest a scheme\nfor the hybrid dynamics that seems to be free of pathological features. This scheme is based on coupled quantum\nand classical ensembles. A related set-up of hybrid dynamics is proposed by Elze and coworkers based on a pathintegral formulation [113], see also [114]. If Hall and Reginato’s claim is true that such schemes can circumvent\nno-go theorems [109, 112], it should be interesting to look again at the features of quantum measurements from\nthe perspective of an explicitly classical apparatus: Bohr’s program can still be opened! A modern view on the\nCopenhagen interpretation developed by (among others) Bohr is presented by Grangier in Refs. [115, 116].\nEveritt, Munro and Spiller discuss a measurement model which, while fully quantum mechanical, makes use of\nanalogy with classical features of the apparatus [117]. The model consists of a two-level system (the measured\nsystem), the apparatus, which is a one-dimensional quartic oscillator under external driving, and an environment\nwhose influence on the system + apparatus is described within the Lindblad master-equation approach and its quantum\nstate diffusion unravelling [118]. The main point of this work is that the apparatus can display the chaotic features\nof a damped forced non-linear oscillator (and is thus not related to Hamiltonian chaos). Everitt, Munro and Spiller\nmake use of this point for the following reason: The feature of chaos allows one to distinguish quantum from classical\nregimes for the apparatus (this is not fundamental - simply a convenience for demonstrating a quantum to classical\ntransition). The model reproduces certain features expected from individual measurement outcomes, but this happens\nat the cost of unravelling the master equation, a relatively arbitrary procedure of going from density matrices to\nrandom wavefunctions. The authors of Ref. [117] are aware of this arbitrariness and attempt to minimize it. It should\nbe noted that, as one would expect, in the classical limit the choice of how to unravel seems to have no effect ons\nthe emergence of a classical dynamic (see, for example, [119]). This implies that the results of [117] may well be\nindependent of the unravelling – but this has yet to be demonstrated.\nIn Ref. [120] Blanchard and Jadczyk discuss a quantum-classical model for measurements. They present it as a\nminimal phenomenological model for describing quantum measurements within the concept of an explicitly classical\napparatus. In contrast to other quantum-classical models, Blanchard and Jadczyk consider a dissipative interaction\nbetween the quantum and classical subsystems. This interaction is modeled by a completely positive map. These\nmaps are frequently applied for describing an open-system quantum dynamics, where the target system couples with\nan external environment; see e.g. Refs. [121, 122, 123]. (However, this is certainly not the only possibility for an\nopen-system quantum dynamics; see in this context Ref. [124].) Blanchard and Jadczyk find a simple form of the\ncompletely map that suffices for accounting (phenomenologically) for certain features of quantum measurements,\nsuch the response of the pointer classical states to the initial state of the quantum system, as well as the proper final\nstate of the quantum system.\nThis approach is generalized in [125], where Blanchard and Jadczyk account for the emergence of events during\nthe quantum measurements. This is done by introducing an additional phenomenological step thereby the quantumclassical dynamics for the quantum density matrix and classical probability distribution is regarded as the result of\naveraging over the states of some underlying stochastic process (a procedure akin to unraveling the open-system\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n24\n\nquantum master equation). The stochastic process – which gives rise to what Blanchard and Jadczyk call eventenhanced quantum theory – is formulated in the tensor product of the classical subsystem’s event space and the\nquantum subsystem’s Hilbert space.\nIn our opinion this approach to quantum measurements has an extensively phenomenological character, a fact\nwell-admitted by Blanchard and Jadczyk. On the other hand, its central idea that the emergence of measurement\nevents should be related to specific features of the measuring apparatus is certainly valuable and will be developed in\nthe present work.\nIn closing this subsection we note that the relation between quantum and classical has yet another, geometrical\ntwist, because the pure-state quantum dynamics (described by the Schrödinger equation) can be exactly mapped\nto a classical Hamiltonian dynamics evolving in a suitable classical symplectic space [126, 127, 128]. Quantum\naspects (such as uncertainties and the Planck’s constant) are then reflected via a Riemannian metrics in this space\n[127, 128]; see also [129] for a recent review. This is a geometrical counterpart to the usual algebraic description of\nquantum mechanics, and is considered to be a potentially rich source for various generalizations of quantum mechanics\n[129, 130]. A formulation of the quantum measurement problem in this language was attempted in [130]. We note\nthat so far this approach is basically restricted to pure states (see, however, [128] in this context).\nFurther references on crucial aspects of the quantum-to-classical transition are [131, 132, 133].\n2.2.1. Measurements in underlying classical theory\nNon quia difficilia sunt non audemus,\nsed quia non audemus, difficilia sunt23\nSeneca\nThe major part of this section is devoted to measurement models, where the measuring apparatus is modeled as\na classical system. There is another line of research, where quantum mechanics as such is viewed as as an approximation of a stochastic classical theory; see, e.g. [134, 135, 136, 137], and [138, 139, 140, 141, 142] . The ultimate\npromise of such approaches is to go beyond the predictions of quantum mechanics; see, e.g. [140]. Their basic\nproblem is to reconcile essential differences between the probability structures in quantum mechanics and classical\nmechanics. There are numerous attempts of such effective classical descriptions, but many of them do not pay much\nattention to those differences, focusing instead on deriving classically certain aspects of quantum theory (stochastic\nelectrodynamics is a vivid example of such an attitude).\nRecent works by Khrennikov and coauthors attempt to explain how an underlying classical theory can reproduce\nthe probability rules of quantum mechanics without conflicting with Bell theorems, contextuality etc. [139, 141,\n142]24 . This is done by postulating specific scenarios for uncertainties produced during a measurement, by means of\nimprecise apparatuses, of the underlying classical objects (random fields). In this sense the works by Khrennikov and\ncoauthors [141, 142] belong to the realm of quantum measurements and will be reviewed now.\nThe starting point of the approach is based on the following observation [139, 140, 141, 142]. Let a classical\nrandom vector (x1 , · · · , xn ) be given with zero average x̄k = 0 for k = 1, · · · , n. Let (x1 , · · · , xn ) be observed through\nthe mean value of a scalar function f (x1 , · · · , xn ). We assume that f (0, · · · , 0) = 0 and that fluctuations of xk around its\nP\naverage are small. Hence, f (x1 , · · · , xn ) = ni, j=1 12 xi x j ∂ xi ∂ x j f (0, · · · , 0). If the symmetric and positive matrix ρ with\nelements ρi j = 21 xi x j is regarded as a density matrix, and the symmetric matrix A with elements Ai j = ∂ xi ∂ x j f (0, · · · , 0)\nas an observable, one can write f (x1 , · · · , xn ) = tr ρA, which has the form of Born’s formula for calculating the average\nof A in the state ρ. By this principle all the quantum observables can be represented as averages over classical random\nfields. Taking complex valued classical random fields one can make both ρ and A hermitean instead of just symmetric.\nAs it presently stands, this approach is purely phenomenological and is simply aimed at replacing quantum observables\nby classical averages in a mathematically exact manner. No interpretation of the physical meaning of (x1 , · · · , xn ) is\ngiven25 . In a way this representation of quantum averages via classical random fields goes back to the wave-modus of\naccounting for quantum effects. This is why it is important to see how experiments that demonstrate the existence of\n23 It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, but because we do not dare, things are difficult\n24 For an (over)simplified discussion of the Bell theorem and related matters, see [143]\n25 They may show up, though, as the resonant modes in a dynamical path integral description of Stochastic Electrodynamics\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n25\n\nphoton as a corpuscle (particle) fit into this picture. Khrennikov and coauthors show that also experiments detecting the\ncorpuscular nature of light can be accommodated in this classical picture provided that one accounts for the threshold\nof the detectors [141, 142]. Here the existence of photon is a consequence of specific modifications introduced\nby threshold detectors when measuring classical random fields. Khrennikov and co-authors stress that this picture is\nhypothetical as long as one has not verified experimentally whether the threshold dependence of real experiments does\nindeed have this specific form [141]. In their opinion this question is non-trivial and still awaits for its experimental\nresolution.\nThis resolution should also point out whether the idea of accounting for specific features of quantum probability\n(such as Bell’s inequality) via classical models is tenable [138, 139, 141, 142]. It is currently realized that the violation of Bell’s inequalities [27, 29, 31, 34] should be attributed to the non-commutative nature of the distribution\nD̂ rather than to non-locality; quantum mechanics does not involve ordinary probabilities nor ordinary correlations.\nThe violation of the classical inequality, observed experimentally [144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149] arises when one\nputs together outcomes of measurements performed in different experimental contexts, and this may itself be a problem [150, 151, 152, 153, 154]. The discussion of § 8.3.4 shows how quantum and ordinary correlations may be\nreconciled in the context of a thought experiment where one attempts to measure simultaneously, with a unique setting, all spin components.\n2.3. Explicitly infinite apparatus: Coleman–Hepp and related models\nBefore you milk a cow,\ntie it up\nSouth African proverb\nSeveral authors argued that once the quantum measurement apparatus is supposed to be a macroscopic system, the\nmost natural framework for describing measurements is to assume that it is explicitly infinite; see the review by Bub\n[155]. C ∗ -algebras is the standard tool for dealing with this situation [156]. Its main peculiarity is that there are (many)\ninequivalent unitary representations of the algebra of observables, i.e., certain superpositions between wavefunctions\ncannot be physical states (in contrast to finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces) [155]. This is supposed to be helpful in\nconstructing measurement models. Hepp proposed first such models [12]. He starts his investigation by stating some\namong the goals of quantum measurement models. In particular, he stresses that an important feature of the problem\nis in getting classical correlations between the measured observable and the pointer variable of the apparatus, and\nthat quantum mechanics is a theory that describes probabilities of certain events. Hepp then argues that the quantum\nmeasurement problem can be solved, i.e., the required classical correlations can be established dynamically, if one\nrestricts oneself to macroscopic observables. He then moves to concrete models, which are solved in the C ∗ -algebraic\nframework. The infinite system approach is also employed in the quantum measurement model proposed by WhittenWolfe and Emch [157]. A C ∗ -algebraic framework was recently employed by Landsman for deriving mathematically\nthe classical limit of quantum mechanics and from it the Born rule [158].\nHowever, working with an infinite measuring apparatus hides the physical meaning of the approach, because\nsome important dynamic scales of the quantum measurement do depend on the number of degrees of freedom of the\napparatus [68]. In particular, the truncation time may tend to zero in the limit of an infinite apparatus and cannot then\nbe evaluated. Thus, making the apparatus explicitly infinite (instead of taking it large, but finite) misses an important\npiece of physics, and does not allow to understand which features of the quantum measurement will survive for a\napparatus having a mesoscopic scale.\nHepp also studies several exactly solvable models, which demonstrate various aspects of his proposal. One of\nthem—proposed to Hepp by Coleman and nowadays called the Coleman–Hepp model— describes an ultra-relativistic\nparticle interacting with a linear chain of spins. Hepp analyzes this model in the infinite apparatus situation; this\nhas several drawbacks, e.g., the overall measurement time is obviously infinite. The physical representation of the\nColeman–Hepp Hamiltonian is improved by Nakazato and Pascazio [159]. They show that the basic conclusions on\nthe Coleman–Hepp Hamiltonian approach can survive in a more realistic model, where the self-energy of the spin\nchain is taken into account. Nakazato and Pascazio also discuss subtleties involved in taking the thermodynamic\nlimit for the model [159]. The Coleman–Hepp model with a large but finite number of the apparatus particles is\nstudied by Sewell [160, 161, 162]. He improves on previous treatments by carefully calculating the dependence of\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n26\n\nthe characteristic times of the model on this number, and discusses possible imperfections of the measurement model\narising from a finite number of particles.\nUsing the example of the Coleman–Hepp model, Bell demonstrates explicitly [92] that the specific features of\nthe quantum measurement hold only for a certain class of observables, including macroscopic observables [69, 160,\n161, 162]. It is then possible to construct an observable for which those features do not hold [92]. We recall that the\nsame holds in the irreversibility problem: it is always possible to construct an observable of a macroscopic system\n(having a large, but finite number of particles) that will not show the signs of irreversible dynamics, i.e., it will not\nbe subject to relaxation. Bell takes this aspect as an essential drawback and states that the quantum measurement was\nnot and cannot be solved within a statistical mechanics approach [92]. Our attitude in the present paper is different.\nWe believe that although concrete models of quantum measurements may have various drawbacks, the resolution of\nthe measurement problem is definitely to be sought along the routes of quantum statistical mechanics. The fact that\ncertain restrictions on the set of observables are needed, simply indicates that, similar to irreversibility, a quantum\nmeasurement is an emergent phenomenon of a large system – the tested system combined with the apparatus – over\nsome characteristic time.\n2.4. Quantum statistical models\nIf I have a thousand ideas and only one turns out to be good,\nI am satisfied\nAlfred Bernhard Nobel\nHere we describe several models based on quantum statistical mechanics. In contrast to the previous chapter, these\nmodels do not invoke anything beyond the standard quantum mechanics of finite though large systems.\nGreen proposed a realistic model of quantum measurement [163]. He emphasizes the necessity of describing the\napparatus via a mixed, quasi-equilibrium state and stresses that the initial state of the apparatus should be macroscopic\nand metastable. The model studied in [163] includes a spin- 21 particle interacting with two thermal baths at different\ntemperatures. The two-temperature situation serves to simulate metastability. The tested particle switches interaction\nbetween the baths. By registering the amount of heat flow through the baths (a macroscopic pointer variable), one\ncan draw certain conclusions about the initial state of the spin. Off-diagonal terms of the spin density matrix are\nsuppressed via a mechanism akin to inhomogeneous broadening. However, an explicit analysis of the dynamic regime\nand its characteristic times is absent.\nCini studies a simple model for the quantum measurement process which illustrates some of the aspects related to\nthe macroscopic character of the apparatus [164]. The model is exactly solvable and can be boiled down to a spin- 12\nparticle (tested spin) interacting with a spin-L particle (apparatus). The interaction Hamiltonian is ∝ σz Lz , where σz\nand Lz are, respectively, the third components of the spin- 12 and spin L. Cini shows that in the limit L \u001d 1 and for a\nsufficiently long interaction time, the off-diagonal terms introduced by an (arbitrary) initial state of the tested spin give\nnegligible contributions to the observed quantities, i.e., to the variables of the tested spin and the collective variables\nof the apparatus. The characteristic times of this process are analyzed, as well as the situation with a large but finite\nvalue of L.\nIn Refs. [10, 11] Blokhintsev studies, within the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics, several interesting measurement models with a metastable initial state of the apparatus: an incoming test particle interacting\nwith an apparatus-particle in a metastable potential well, a test neutron triggering a nuclear chain reaction, et cetera.\nThough the considered models are physically appealing, the involved measurement apparatuses are frequently not\nreally macroscopic. Neither does Blokhintsev pay proper attention to the correlations between the system and the\napparatus in the final state.\nRequardt studies a quantum measurement model, in which due to collisional interaction with the tested system,\nthe pointer variable of a macroscopic measuring apparatus undergoes a coherent motion, in which the momentum\ncorrelates with the values of the measured observable (coordinate) [165]. It is stressed that for the approach to have\na proper physical meaning, the apparatus should have a large but finite number of degrees of freedom. However,\nno detailed account of characteristic measurement times is given. Requardt also assumes that the initial state of the\nmeasurement apparatus is described by a wave function, which is merely consistent with the macroscopic information\ninitially available on this apparatus. He focuses on those aspects of the model which will likely survive in a more\ngeneral theory of quantum measurements; see in this context his later work [69] that is reviewed below.\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n27\n\nAn interesting statistical mechanical model of quantum measurement was proposed and studied in Ref. [166] by\nGaveau and Schulman. The role of apparatus is played by a one-dimensional Ising spin model. Two basic energy\nparameters of the model are an external field and the spin-spin coupling (exchange coupling). An external field is\ntuned in such a way that a spontaneous flipping of one spin is energetically not beneficial, while the characteristic\ntime of flipping two spins simultaneously is very large. This requirement of metastability puts an upper limit on the\nnumber of spins in the apparatus. The tested spin 12 interacts only with one spin of the apparatus; this is definitely an\nadvantage of this model. The spin-apparatus interaction creates a domino effect bringing the apparatus to a unique\nferrromagnetic state. This happens for the tested spin pointing up. For the tested spin pointing down nothing happens,\nsince in this state the tested spin does not interact with the apparatus. Characteristic times of the measurement are\nnot studied in detail, though Gaveau and Schulman calculate the overall relaxation time and the decay time of the\nmetastable state. It is unclear whether this model is supposed to work for an arbitrary initial state of the tested spin.\nRef. [167] by Merlin studies a quantum mechanical model for distinguishing two different types of bosonic particles. The model is inspired by Glaser’s chamber device, and has the realistic feature that the bosonic particle to be\ntested interacts only with one particle of the apparatus (which by itself is made out of bosons). The initial state of\nthe apparatus is described by a pure state and it is formally metastable (formally, because this is not a thermodynamic\nmetastability). The relaxation process is not accounted for explicitly; its consequences are simply postulated. No\nanalysis of characteristic relaxation times is presented. Merlin analyses the relation of measurement processes with\nthe phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n2.4.1. Spontaneous symmetry breaking\nLes miroirs feraient bien de réfléchir un peu plus\navant de renvoyer les images26\nJean Cocteau, Le sang d’un poète\nThe role of spontaneous symmetry breaking as an essential ingredient of the quantum measurement process is\nunderlined in papers by Grady [168], Fioroni and Immirzi [169] and Pankovic and Predojevic [170]. They stress that\nsuperpositions of vacuum states are not allowed in quantum field theory, since these superpositions do not satisfy the\ncluster property. All three approaches stay mainly at a qualitative level, though Fioroni and Immirzi go somewhat\nfurther in relating ideas on quantum measurement process to specific first-order phase transition scenarios. An earlier\ndiscussion on symmetry breaking, quantum measurements and geometrical concepts of quantum field theory is given\nby Ne’eman [171].\nRef. [172] by Zimanyi and Vladar also emphasizes the relevance of phase transitions and symmetry breaking for\nquantum measurements. They explicitly adopt the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics. General statements\nare illustrated via the Caldeira-Leggett model [173, 174, 175, 176]: a two-level system coupled to a bath of harmonic\noscillators. This model undergoes a second-order phase transition with relatively weak decay of off-diagonal terms\nin the thermodynamic limit, provided that the coupling of the two-level system to the bath is sufficiently strong. The\nauthors speculate about extending their results to first-order phase transitions. A dynamical consideration is basically\nabsent and the physical meaning of the pointer variable is not clear.\nThus the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking is frequently discussed in the context of quantum measurement models (although it is not anymore strictly spontaneous, but driven by the interaction with the system of which\nthe observable is to be measured). It is also an essential feature of the approach discussed in the present paper. It\nshould however be noted that so far only one scenario of symmetry breaking has been considered in the context of\nquantum measurements (the one that can be called the classical scenario), where the higher temperature extremum\nof the free energy becomes unstable (or at least metastable) and the system moves to another, more stable state (with\nlower free energy). Another scenario is known for certain quantum systems (e.g., quantum antiferromagnets) with a\nlow-temperature spontaneously symmetry broken state; see, e.g., [177]. Here the non-symmetric state is not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, and (in general) does not have less energy than the unstable ground state. The consequences\nof this (quantum) scenario for quantum measurements are so far not explored. However, recently van Wezel, van den\nBrink and Zaanen study specific decoherence mechanisms that are induced by this scenario of symmetry breaking.\n[177].\n26 Mirrors should reflect some more before sending back the images\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n28\n\n2.4.2. System-pointer-bath models\nJe moet met de juiste wapens ten strijde trekken27\nDutch proverb\nRefs. [178] by Haake and Walls and [179] by Haake and Zukowski study a measurement of a discrete-spectrum\nvariable coupled to a single-particle apparatus (the meter). The latter is a harmonic oscillator, and it interacts with\na thermal bath, which is modeled via harmonic oscillators. The interaction between the tested system and the meter\nis impulsive (it lasts a short time) and involves the tensor product of the measured observable and the momentum\nof the meter. There are two characteristic times here: on the shorter time, the impulsive interaction correlates the\nstates of the object and of the meter, while on the longer time scale the state of the meter becomes classical under\nthe influence of the thermal bath, and the probability distribution of the meter coordinate is prepared via mixing welllocalized probability distributions centered at the eigenvalues of the measured quantity, with the weights satisfying\nthe Born rule [1]. (This sequence of processes roughly corresponds to the ideas of decoherence theory; see below for\nmore detail.) At an even longer time scale the meter will completely thermalize and forget about its interaction with\nthe tested system. The authors of [178, 179] also consider a situation where the meter becomes unstable under the\ninfluence of the thermal bath, since it now feels an inverted parabolic potential. Then the selection of the concrete\nbranch of instability can be driven by the interaction with the object. Since the initial state of such an unstable\noscillator is not properly metastable, one has to select a special regime where the spontaneous instability decay can\nbe neglected.\nThe quantum measurement model studied in [180] by Venugopalan is in many aspects similar to models investigated in [178, 179]. The author stresses relations of the studied model to ideas from the decoherence theory.\nRef. [181] by the present authors investigates a model of quantum measurement where the macroscopic measurement apparatus is modeled as an ideal Bose gas, in which the amplitude of the condensate is taken as the pointer\nvariable. The model is essentially based on the properties of irreversibility and of ergodicity breaking, which are\ninherent in the model apparatus. The measurement process takes place in two steps: First, the truncation of the state\nof the tested system takes place, this process is governed by the apparatus-system interaction. During the second step\nclassical correlations are established between the apparatus and the tested system over the much longer time scale of\nequilibration of the apparatus. While the model allows to understand some basic features of the quantum measurement\nas a driven phase-transition, its dynamical treatment contains definite drawbacks. First, the Markov approximation\nfor the apparatus-bath interaction, though correct for large times, is incorrectly employed for very short times, which\ngreatly overestimates the truncation time. Another drawback is that the model is based on the phase transition in an\nideal Bose gas. This transition is known to have certain pathological features (as compared to a more realistic phasetransition in a weakly interacting Bose gas). Though the authors believe that this fact would be repairable and does\nnot influence the qualitative outcomes of the model, it is certainly desirable to have better models, where the phase\ntransition scenario would be generic and robust. Such models will be considered in later chapters of this work.\nIn Ref. [182, 183] Spehner and Haake present a measurement model that in several aspects improves upon previous\nmodels. The model includes the tested system, an oscillator (generally anharmonic), which plays the role of apparatus,\nand a thermal bath coupled to the oscillator. The time scales of the model are set in such a way that the correlations\nbetween the measured observable of the system and the pointer variable of the apparatus (here the momentum of the\nanharmonic oscillator) and the decay of the off-diagonal terms of the tested system density matrix are established\nsimultaneously. This implies realistically that no macroscopic superpositions are generated. In addition, the initial\nstate of the apparatus and its bath is not assumed to be factorized, which makes it possible to study strong (and also\nanharmonic) apparatus-bath couplings.\nRef. [184] by Mozyrsky and Privman studies a quantum measurement model, which consists of three parts: the\ntested system, the apparatus and a thermal bath that directly couples to the system (and not to the apparatus). The\ninitial state of the apparatus is not metastable, it is chosen to be an equilibrium state. The dynamics of the measured observable of the system is neglected in the course of measurement. The authors of [184] show that after\nsome decoherence time their model is able to reproduce specific correlations that are expected for a proper quantum\nmeasurement.\n27 You must go into battle with the right weapons\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n29\n\nOmnès recently studied a model for a quantum measurement [185]. The pointer variable of the apparatus is supposed to be its (collective) coordinate. The introduction of the measurement process is accompanied by a discussion\non self-organization. For solving this Omnès partially involves the mean-field method, because the many-body apparatus density matrix is substituted by the tensor product of the partial density matrices. The dynamics of the model\ninvolves both decoherence and reduction. These two different processes are analysed together and sometimes in rather\ncommon terms, which can obscure important physical differences between them. In the second part Omnès studies\nfluctuations of the observation probabilities for various measurement results. These fluctuations are said to arise due\nto a coupling with an external environment modeled as a phonon bath.\nVan Kampen stresses the importance of considering a macroscopic and metastable measuring apparatus and proposes a model that is supposed to illustrate the main aspects of the measurement process [14]. The model consists of\na single atom interacting with a multi-mode electromagnetic field, which is playing the role of apparatus. The emitted\nphoton that is generated correlates with the value of the measured observable. The apparatus can be macroscopic\n(since the vacuum has many modes), but its (thermodynamically) metastable character is questionable. The measurement of a photon by one of the remote detectors is not solved in detail, and its main dynamical consequences are not\nanalyzed. Nevertheless, van Kampen offers a qualitative analysis of this model, which appears to support the common intuition on quantum measurements. The resulting insights are summarized in his “ten theorems” on quantum\nmeasurements.\n2.4.3. Towards model-independent approaches\nQui se soucie de chaque petite plume\nne devrait pas faire le lit28\nSwiss proverb\nSewell [160, 161, 162] and independently Requardt [69] attempt to put the results obtained from several models\ninto a single model-independent approach, which presumably may pave a way towards a general theory of quantum\nmeasurements. The basic starting point of the approach is that the measuring apparatus, being a many-body quantum\nsystem, does have a set of macroscopic, mutually commuting observables {A1 , . . . , AM } with M a macroscopic integer.\nThe commutation is approximate for a large, but finite number of reservoir particles, but it becomes exact in the\nthermodynamic limit for the apparatus. Each Ak is typically a normalized sum over a large number of apparatus\nparticles. The set {A1 , . . . , AM } is now partioned into macroscopic cells; each such cell refers to some subspace in the\nHilbert space formed by a common eigenvector. The cells are distinguished from each other by certain combinations\nof the eigenvalues of {A1 , . . . , AM }. The purpose of partitioning into cells is to correlate each eigenvalue of the\nmicroscopic observable to be measured with the corresponding cell. In the simplest situation the latter set reduces to\njust one observable A, while two cells refer to the subspace formed by the eigenvectors of A associated with positive or\nnegative eigenvalues. Further derivations, which so far are carried out on the levels of models only [69, 160, 161, 162],\namount to showing that a specific coupling between the system and the apparatus can produce their joint final state,\nwhich from the viewpoint of observables Ak ⊗ S – where S is any observable of the microscopic measured system –\ndoes have several features required for a good (or even ideal) quantum measurement.\n2.4.4. Ergodic theory approach\nWenn i wieder, wieder komm 29\nFrom the German folk song “Muß i denn”\nDaneri, Loinger and Prosperi approach quantum measurements via the quantum ergodic theory [21]. Such an\napproach is anticipated in the late forties by the works of Jordan [186] and Ludwig [187]. Daneri, Loinger and Prosperi\nmodel the measuring apparatus as a macroscopic system, which in addition to energy has another conserved quantity,\nwhich serves the role of the pointer variable. Under the influence of the system to be measured this conservation\nis broken, and there is a possibility to correlate different values of the measured observable with the pointer values.\nDaneri, Loinger and Prosperi invoke the basic assumption of ergodic theory and treat the overall density matrix via\n28 Who cares about every little feather should not make the bed\n29 When I come, come again\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n30\n\ntime-averaging [21]. The time-averaged density matrix satisfies the necessary requirements for an ideal measurement.\nHowever, the use of the time-averaging does not allow to understand the dynamics of the quantum measurement\nprocess, because no information about the actual dynamical time scales is retained in the time-averaged density matrix.\nAlso, although the initial state of the measuring apparatus does have some properties of metastability, it is not really\nmetastable in the thermodynamic sense.\nThe publication of the paper by Daneri, Loinger and Prosperi in early sixties induced a hot debate on the measurement problem; see [188] for a historical outline. We shall not attempt to review this debate here, but only mention\none aspect of it: Tausk (see [188] for a description of his unpublished work) and later on Jauch, Wigner and Yanase\n[189] criticize the approach by Daneri, Loinger and Prosperi via the argument of an interaction free measurement.\nThis type of measurements is first discussed by Renninger [190]. The argument goes as follows: sometimes one\ncan gather information about the measured system even without any macroscopic process generated in the measuring\napparatus. This can happen, for instance, in the double-slit experiment when the apparatus measuring the coordinate\nof the particle is placed only at one slit. Then the non-detection by this apparatus will – ideally – indicate that the\nparticle passed through the other slit. The argument thus intends to demonstrate that quantum measurements need not\nbe related to macroscopic (or irreversible) processes. This argument however does not present any special difficulty\nwithin the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics, where both the wavefunction and the density matrix refer\nto an ensemble of identically prepared system. Although it is true that not every single realization of the apparatusparticle interaction has to be related to a macroscopic process, the probabilities of getting various measurement results\ndo rely on macroscopic processes in the measuring apparatus.\n2.5. No-go theorems and small measuring apparatuses\nNon ho l’età, per amarti30\nLyrics by Mario Penzeri, sung by Gigliola Cinquetti\nThe quantum measurement process is regarded as a fundamental problem, also because over the years several\nno–go theorems were established showing that the proper conditions for quantum measurement cannot be satisfied\nif they are demanded as exact features of the final state of the apparatus [13, 191, 192, 193]. The first such theorem\nwas established by Wigner [13]. Then several extensions of this theorem were elaborated by Fine [194] and Shimony\nwith co-authors [191, 192, 193]. The presentation by Fine is especially clear, as it starts from the minimal conditions\nrequired from a quantum measurement [194]. After stating the no-go theorem, Fine proceeds to discuss in which\nsense one should look for approximate schemes that satisfy the measurement conditions, a general program motivating\nalso the present study. The results of Refs. [191, 192, 193] show that even when allowing certain imperfections in\nthe apparatus functioning, the quantum measurement problem remains unsolvable in the sense that the existence of\nspecific classical correlations in the final state of the system + apparatus cannnot be ensured; see also in this context\nthe recent review by Bassi and Ghirardi [17]. In our viewpoint, the no-go theorems do not preclude approximate\nsatisfaction of the quantum measurement requirements – owing to a macroscopic size of the apparatus.\nTurning this point over, one may ask which features of proper quantum measurements (as displayed by successful\nmodels of this phenomenon) would survive for an apparatus that is not macroscopically large. There are several\ndifferent ways to pose this question, e.g., below we shall study the measuring apparatus (that already performs well\nin the macroscopic limit) for a large but finite number of particles. Another approach was recently worked out by\nAllahverdyan and Hovhannisyan [77]. They assume that the measuring apparatus is a finite system, and study systemapparatus interaction setups that lead to transferring certain matrix elements of the unknown density matrix λ of the\nsystem into those of the final state e\nr of the apparatus. Such a transfer process represents one essential aspect of the\nquantum measurement with a macroscopic apparatus. No further limitations on the interaction are introduced, because\nthe purpose is to understand the implications of the transfer on the final state of the system. It is shown that the transfer\nprocess eliminates from the final state of the system the memory about the transferred matrix elements (or certain other\nones) [77]. In particular, if one diagonal matrix element is transferred, e\nraa = λaa , the memory on all non-diagonal\nelements λa,b or λb,a related to this diagonal element is completely eliminated from the final density operator of the\nsystem (the memory on other non-diagonal elements λcd , where c , a and d , a may be preserved). Thus, the general\n30 I do not have the age to love you\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n31\n\naspect of state disturbance in quantum measurements is the loss of memory about off-diagonal elements, rather than\ndiagonalization (which means the vanishing of the off-diagonal elements).\n2.6. An open problem: A model for a non-statistical interpretation of the measurement process.\nWe can’t go on forever, with suspicious minds\nWritten by Mark James, sung by Elvis Presley\nThe statistical interpretation together with supporting models does provide a consistent view on measurements\nwithin the standard quantum mechanics. However, it should be important to understand whether there are other\nconsistent approaches from within the standard quantum formalism that can provide an alternative view on quantum\nmeasurements. Indeed, it cannot be excluded that the real quantum measurement is a wide notion, which combines\ninstances of different interpretations. In the present review we will not cover approaches that introduce additional\ningredients to the standard quantum theory, and will only mention them in subsection 2.8.\nWe focus only on one alternative to the statistical interpretation, which is essentially close to the Copenhagen\ninterpretation [83, 84, 85, 195] and is based on effectively non-linear Schrödinger equation. We should however stress\nthat so far the approach did not yet provide a fully consistent and unifying picture of quantum measurements even for\none model.\nRecently Brox, Olaussen and Nguyen approached quantum measurements via a non-linear Schrödinger equation\n[196]. The authors explicitly adhere to a version of the Copenhagen interpretation, where the wave function (the\npure quantum state) refers to a single system. They present a model which is able to account for single measurement\nevents. The model consists of a spin- 12 (the system to be measured), a ferromagnet (the measuring apparatus), and\nthe apparatus environment. The overall system is described by a pure wavefunction. The ferromagnetic apparatus\nis prepared in an (unbiased) initial state with zero magnetization. The two ground states of the ferromagnet have\na lower energy and, respectively, positive and negative magnetization. Moving towards one of these states under\ninfluence of the tested system is supposed to amplify the weak signal coming from this tested system. (The latter\nfeatures will also play an important role in the models to be considered in detail later on.) The environment is\nmodeled as a spin-glass: environmental spins interact with random (positive or negative) coupling constants. So far\nall these factors are more or less standard, and – as stressed by the authors – these factors alone cannot account for a\nsolution of the measurement problem within an interpretation that ascribes the wavefunction to a single system. The\nnew point introduced by Brox, Olaussen and Nguyen is that the effective interaction between the apparatus and the\nmeasured system is non-linear in the wavefunction: it contains an analogue of a self-induced magnetic field [196].\nIn contrast to the existing approaches, where non-linearity in the Schrödinger equation are introduced axiomatically,\nBrox, Olaussen and Nguyen state that their non-linearity can in fact emerge from the Hartree-Fock approach: it is\nknown that in certain situations (the Vlasov limit) the many-body Schrödinger equation can be reduced to a non-linear\nequation for the single-particle wave function [197]. Examples of this are the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for Bose\ncondensates [197] or the non-linear equation arising during quantum feedback control [198]. However, the statement\nby Brox, Olaussen and Nguyen on the emergent non-linearity is not really proven, which is an essential drawback.\nLeaving this problem aside, these authors show numerically that the specific nonlinearity in the system-apparatus\ninteraction may lead to a definite, albeit random, measurement result. The statistics of this randomness approximately\nsatisfies the Born rule [1], which emerges due to the macroscopic size of the apparatus. The cause of this randomness\nis the classical randomness related to the choice of the spin-glass interaction constants in the environment [196], i.e.,\nfor different such choices (each one still ensuring the proper relaxation of the apparatus) one gets different singlemeasurement results. Thus in this approach the cause of the randomness in measurement results is not the irreducible\nquantum randomness, but rather the usual classical randomness, which is practically unavoidable in the preparation\nof a macroscopic environment. Brox, Olaussen and Nguyen argue that the nonlinearity in the system-bath interaction\n– which is crucial for obtaining all the above effects – need not be large, since the amplification may be ensured by a\nlarge size of the ferromagnet [196]. Their actual numerical calculations are however carried out only for moderate-size\nspin systems.\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n32\n\n2.7. Decoherence theory\nPure coherence is delirium,\nit is abstract delirium\nBaruch Spinoza\nPresently it is often believed that decoherence theory solves the quantum measurement problem. So let us introduce this concept. Decoherence refers to a process, where due to coupling with an external environment, off-diagonal\nelements of the system density matrix decay in time; see [32, 33, 40, 199, 200, 201, 202] for reviews. The basis where\nthis decay happens is selected by the structure of the system-environment coupling. In this way the system acquires\nsome classical features.\nDecoherence is well known since the late 40’s [203]. One celebrated example is spin relaxation in NMR experiments. The decay of the transverse polarization, perpendicular to the permanently applied field, is in general\ncharacterized by the relaxation time T2 ; it can be viewed as a decoherence of the spin system, since it exhibits the\ndecay of the off-diagonal contributions to the spin density matrix in the representation where the applied Hamiltonian\nis diagonal [204, 205]. Another standard example is related to the Pauli equation for an open quantum system weakly\ncoupled to an external thermal bath [206]. This equation can be visualized as a classical stochastic process during\nwhich the system transits from one energy level to another.\nMore recently decoherence has attracted attention as a mechanism of quantum-to-classical transition, and was\napplied to the quantum measurement problem [32, 33, 40, 199, 200, 201, 202]. The standard pattern of such an application relies on an initial impulsive interaction of the von Neumann type which correlates (entangles) the measuring\napparatus with the system to be measured. Generally, this step is rather unrealistic, since it realizes macroscopic\nsuperpositions, which were never seen in any realistic measurement or any measurement model. Next, one assumes\na specific environment for the apparatus, with the environment-apparatus interaction Hamiltonian directly related to\nthe variable to be measured. Moreover, within the decoherence approach it is stressed – e.g., by Zurek in [33] and\nby Milburn and Walls in [201] – that the observable to-be-measured is determined during the process generated by\nthe apparatus-environment interaction. The latter is supposed to diagonalize the density matrix of the system plus the\napparatus in a suitable basis. This second step is again unrealistic, since it assumes that the variable to be measured,\nwhich is normally under control of the experimentalist, must somehow correlate with the structure of the system’s environment, which – by its very definition – is out of direct control. To put it in metaphoric terms, decoherence theory\nasserts that the surrounding air measures a person’s size. But without explicit pointer variable that can be read off, this\nis not what one normally understands under measuring a person’s size; we consider measurement without a readable\npointer variable merely as a linguistic redefinition of the concept, that obscures the real issue. These criticisms of the\ndecoherence theory approach agree with the recent analysis by Requardt [69].\nOne even notes that, as far as the problem of quantum-to-classical transition is concerned, the decoherence cannot\nbe regarded as the only – or even as the basic – mechanism of this transition. As convincingly argued by Wiebe\nand Ballentine [133] and Ballentine [207], realistic macroscopic Hamiltonian systems can – and sometimes even\nshould – achieve the classical limit without invoking any decoherence effect. This concerns both chaotic and regular\nHamiltonian systems, although the concrete scenarios of approaching the classical limit differ for the two cases.\nIn spite of these caveats that prevent decoherence theory from providing the solution, it has been valuable in\nshaping the ideas on quantum measurement models, In particular, this concerns a recent attempt by Omnès to develop\na general theory of decoherence via ideas and methods of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics [89] (see also [185]\nthat we reviewed above). Among the issues addressed in [89] is the generality of the system-environment structure\nthat leads to decoherence, the physical meaning of separating the system from the environment, and the relation of the\ndecoherence theory to the hydrodynamic description.\n2.7.1. “Envariance” and Born’s rule\nTry to see it my way,\nOnly time will tell if I am right or I am wrong\nThe Beatles, We can’t work it out\nIn recent papers [208, 209] Zurek attempts to derive Born’s rule without a direct appeal to measurement theory, but\nsolely from features of transformations termed environment-assisted invariance (or envariance) plus a set of additional\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n33\n\nassumptions. These assumptions are partially spelled out in [208, 209] and/or pointed out by other authors [210]. If\nsuccessful, such a derivation will be of clear importance, since it will bypass the need for a theory of quantum\nmeasurements. We would like now to review the premises of this derivation.\nFollowing the basic tenet of the decoherence theory, Zurek considers an entangled pure state of the system S and\nits environment E [208, 209]:\n\n|ψSE i =\n\nn\nX\n\nαk |sk i ⊗ |εk i,\n\nk=1\n\nn\nX\n\n|αk |2 = 1.\n\n(2.1)\n\nk=1\n\nThis state is written is the so called Schmidt form with two orthonormal set of vectors {|sk i}k=1,n and {|εk i}k=1,n living\nin the Hilbert spaces of the system and environment, respectively.\nIt is assumed that the pure state (2.1) was attained under the effect of an interaction between S and E which was\nswitched off before our consideration. Any pure state living in the joint Hilbert of S + E can be represented as in (2.1).\nZurek now asks “what can one know about the state of S given the joint state (2.1) of S+E”? He states at the\nvery beginning that he refuses to trace out the environment, because this will make his attempted derivation of Born’s\nrule circular [208, 209]. This means that the wave function (2.1) stands for Zurek as something that should describe\nrelations between observables and their probabilities. This description (Born’s rule) is to be discovered, this is why\none does not want to assume beforehand its linearity over |ψSE ihψSE |.\nThe core of Zurek’s arguments is the following particular case of (2.1) for n = 2 [208, 209]\n2\n\n1 X\n|sk i ⊗ |εk i.\n|ψSE i = √\n2 k=1\n\n(2.2)\n\nUsing certain invariance features of |ψSE i in (2.2) — environment assisted invariance, or envariance — Zurek now\nattempts to derive that S is either in the state |s1 i or in the state |s2 i with probabilities 12 [208, 209]. We stress here that\nα1 = α2 = √12 is really essential for the derivation. A straightforward generalization of (2.2) is employed by Zurek in\nhis attempted derivation of Born’s rule for rational probabilities (on analogy to the classical definition of probability\nas a ratio of two integers), which is then extended to arbitrary probabilities via a continuity argument.\nHowever, we do not need to go into details of this derivation to understand why it fails.\nFirst one notes that due to α1 = α2 the representation (2.1), (2.2) is not unique: any pair of orthonormal vectors\n{|sk i}k=1,2 can appear there. (This question about the derivation by Zurek was raised in [210].) Hence it is not\nmeaningful to say that S is with some probability in a definite state.\nThe actual freedom in choosing the basis for S is even larger, because (2.2) can be respresented as\n|ψSE i =\n\n2\nX\n\nκk |e\nsk i ⊗ |εk i,\n\n(2.3)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere |e\ns1 i and |e\ns2 i are normalized, but not orthogonal to each other. It is impossible to rule out such non-orthogonal\ndecompositions by relying on various invariance features of (2.2) (some arguments of Zurek seem to attempt this),\nbecause these features are necessarily representation-independent.\nAdmittedly, such non-orthogonal decompositions could be ruled out by postulating beforehand that S should be\nin a definite state—thus only orthogonal {|sk i}k=1,2 are accepted—and looking for the probability of these states. But\neven under this orthogonality condition the choice of {|sk i}k=1,2 in (2.2) is not unique due to degeneracy α1 = α2 .\nOne may attempt to reformulate this statement by demanding that E is not an environment, but rather a measuring\napparatus with a fixed basis {|εk i}k=1,2 . This then makes possible to fix {|sk i}k=1,2 . Such a reformulation, natural in the\ncontext of measurement theory, does not seem to be acceptable for the following reason.\nIf one now asserts that S is in the state |s1 i (or |s2 i) with probability 12 ( 21 ), then due to the symmetry between S and\nE, it is possible to assert that E is in the state |ε1 i (or |ε2 i) with probability 12 ( 12 ). This will then amount to stating that\nboth S and E are in definite states with definite probabilities, which is not acceptable for a pure state |ψSE i, because\nthere is no way to prepare the state (2.2) of S + E by mixing (definite states with definite probabilities). For this it\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n34\n\nP\nwould be necessary that the state of S + E be mixed, e.g. 21 2k=1 |sk i ⊗ |εk ihsk | ⊗ hεk |. However, such mixed states do\nnot appear in the present theory that is based on pure states with the prohibition of taking partial traces.\nWe conclude that the proposed derivation for Born’s rule cannot work, because one cannot even state the probability of what is going to be described by Born’s rule. Even if one grants in the form of postulates various assumptions\nneeded for the derivation – i.e., one postulates that S is indeed in a definite but unknown state according to a fixed\nbasis {|sk i}k=1,2 that is chosen somehow – even then the proposed derivation of Born’s rule need not work, since it is\nnot clear that the specific form (2.1) of the wave function S+E (without measuring apparatus?) is ever satisfied within\nrealistic models of quantum measurements.\n2.8. Seeking the solution outside quantum mechanics\nNo, no, you’re not thinking;\nyou’re just being logical\nNiels Bohr\nThough this review will restrict itself to approaches to quantum measurements within the standard quantum mechanics, we briefly list for completeness a number of attempts to seek the solution for the quantum measurement\nproblem beyond it. The de Broglie–Bohm approach [18, 19, 24] is currently one of the most popular alternatives to\nthe standard quantum mechanics. It introduces an additional set of variables (coordinates of the physical particles)\nand represents the Schrödinger equation as an equation of motion for those particles, in addition to the motion of the\nwavefunction, which keeps the physical meaning of a separate entity (guiding field). Hence in this picture there are\ntwo fundamental and separate entities: particles and fields. Recently Smolin attempted to construct a version of the\nde Broglie–Bohm approach, where the wavefunction is substituted by certain phase-variables, which, together with\ncoordinates, are supposed to be features of particles [211]. In this context see also a related contribution by Schmelzer,\nwhere the fundamental character of the wavefunction is likewise negated [212]. The approach by Smolin is coined\nin terms of a real ensemble, which – in contrast to ensembles of non-interacting objects invoked for validation of any\nprobabilistic theory – does contain highly-nonlocal (distance independent) interactions between its constituents. It is\npresently unclear to which extent this substitution of the wavefunction by phase-variables will increase the eligibility\nof the de Broglie–Bohm approach, while Smolin does not discuss the issues of measurement that are known to be\nnon-trivial within the approach [18, 19, 214].\nAnother popular alternative is the spontaneous localization approach by Ghirardi, Rimini and Weber [215]. This\napproach is based on a non-linear and stochastic generalization of the Schrödinger equation such that the collapse\nof the wavefunction happens spontaneously (i.e., without any measurement) with a certain rate governed by classical\nwhite noise. Bassi and Ghirardi recently reviewed this and related approaches in full detail [17]; other useful sources\nare the book by Adler [216] and the review paper by Pearle [217]. Spontaneous localization models in the energy basis\nare especially interesting, since they conserve the average energy of the quantum system; this subject is reviewed by\nBrody and Hughston [218]. Non-linear modifications of the Schrödinger equation have by now a long history [90,\n91, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223]. All of them in one way or another combine non-linearities with classical randomness.\nThe first such model was introduced by Bohm and Bub [219] starting from certain hidden-variables assumption. The\napproaches that followed were either oriented towards resolving the quantum measurement problem [90, 221, 222] or\ntrying to obtain fundamentally nonlinear generalizations of the Schrödinger equation and quantum mechanics [223].\nSeveral approaches of the former type were unified within a formalism proposed by Grigorenko [91]. Recently\nSvetlichny presented a resource letter on fundamental (i.e., not emerging from the usual, linear theory) non-linearities\nin quantum mechanics, where he also discusses their possible origin [224]. Some of those approaches based on\nnonlinear generalizations of the Schrödinger equation were confronted to experiments, see e.g. Refs. [225, 226], but\nso far with negative result.\nA very different approach was taken by De Raedt and Michielsen, who simulate the measurement process by\nspecifying a set of simple rules that mimic the various components of the measurement setup, such as beam splitters,\npolarizers and detectors. They perform numerical simulations using algorithms that the mimic the underlying events,\nand are able to reproduce the statistical distributions given by quantum mechanics [227, 228].\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n35\n\n2.9. A short review on consistent histories\nI shall make sure that EU action develops consistently over time\nHerman Van Rompuy\nThe consistent histories approach negates the fundamental need of measurements for understanding quantum\nmeasurements (quantum mechanics without measurements). It was proposed by Griffiths [229] based on earlier ideas\nof Aharonov, Bergmann and Lebowitz [230]. The approach is reviewed, e.g., by Griffiths [231], Gell-Mann [232],\nHohenberg [233], and Omnès [234]. It aims to develop an interpretation of quantum mechanics valid for a closed\nsystem of any size and any number of particles, the evolution of which is governed by the Liouville–von Neumann\n(or Heisenberg) equation. Within this approach the notion of an event – together with its probability – is defined\nfrom the outset and “measurements”, which do not involve any interaction between the system and some apparatus,\nsimply reveal the pre-existing values of physical quantities. In particular, it is not necessary to invoke either the micromacro separation or statistical assumptions on the initial states needed to derive the irreversibility aspect of quantum\nmeasurements. All of these may still be needed to describe concrete measurements, but the fundamental need for\nunderstanding quantum measurements from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics would be gone, if the consistent\nhistories approach is viable or, at least, will turn out to be really viable in the end.\nHowever, as it stands presently the approach produces results at variance with predictions of the measurementbased quantum mechanics [235] (then it is not important which specific interpretation one prescribes). Hence, within\nits present status, the consistent histories approach cannot be a substitute for the statistical mechanics-based theory\nof quantum measurements. Some authors bypass problems of the consistent histories approach and state that it is\nuseful as a paradox-free reformulation of the standard mechanics; see e.g. the recent review by Hohenberg [233] and\nthe book by Griffiths [231]. In fact the opposite is true: as we explain below, the consistent histories approach adds\nparadoxes that do not exist within the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n2.9.1. Deeper into consistent histories\n31\n\nԳայլի բնում մանր ոսկոր չի մնա:\nArmenian proverb\nThe easiest method of introducing the consistent histories approach is to highlight as soon as possible its differences with respect to the standard measurement-based approach. Let us start with the quantum mechanics formula for\nthe probability of two consecutive measurements M(t1 ) and M(t2 ) carried out at times t1 and t2 (t2 > t1 ):\nh\ni\n\u0002\n\u0003\npt1 ,t2 i, j|M(t1 ), M(t2 ) = tr Π j (t2 )Πi (t1 )ρΠi (t1 )Π j (t2 ) ,\n(2.4)\nP\nP\nwhere ρ is the initial state of the system, Πi (t1 ) with i Πi (t1 ) = 1 and Π j (t2 ) with sum i Πi (t2 ) = 1 are the projectors\nfor the physical quantities (represented by Hermitean operators) A(t1 ) and B(t2 ) measured at the times t1 and t2 ,\nrespectively. For simplicity we assume the Heisenberg representation, and do not write in (2.4) explicit indices for\nA and B. What is however necessary to do is to indicate that the joint probability in (2.4) is explicitly conditional\non the two measurements M(t1 ) and M(t2 ). As expected, the meaning of (2.4) is that the measurement at time t1\n(with probabilities given by Born’s rule) is accompanied by selection of the subensemble referring to the result i. The\nmembers of this subensemble are then measured at the time t2 . Generalization to n-time measurements is obvious.\nWhat now the consistent histories approach does is to skip the context-dependence in (2.4) and regard the resulting\nprobabilities p[i, j] as a description of events taking place spontaneously, i.e. without any measurement and without\nany selection of outcome. The cost to pay is that the initial state ρ and the projectors Πi (t1 ) and Π j (t2 ) have to\nsatisfy a special consistency condition that eliminates the dependence on the specific measurements M1,2 (without\nthis condition the events are not defined):\nh\ni\ntr Π j (t2 )Πi (t1 )ρΠi0 (t1 )Π j0 (t2 ) = δii0 δ j j0 pt1 ,t2 [i, j],\n(2.5)\nwhere δii0 is the Kronecker delta. As a consequence of (2.5), one can sum out the first (i. e., the earlier) random\nP\nvariable and and using the completeness relation i Πi (t1 ) = 1 get the probability for the second event alone:\n31 Don’t look for small bones in the wolf’s den\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\npt2 [ j] =\n\nX\n\nh\ni\npt1 ,t2 [i, j] = tr Π j (t2 )ρΠ j (t2 ) .\n\n36\n\n(2.6)\n\ni\n\nP\nTo show this, one inserts i Π̂i (t1 ) = 1 left and right of ρ and employs (2.5) with j0 = j. Then Eq. (2.4) confirms that\nthe calculated quantity is indeed the desired marginal probability. Note that without condition (2.5), i.e. just staying\nP\nwithin the standard approach (2.4), Eq. (2.6) would not hold, e.g. generally i pt1 ,t2 [i, j|M(t1 ), M(t2 )] still depends on\nM(t1 ) and is not equal to pt2 [ j|M(t2 )] (probability of the outcome j in the second measurement provided that no first\nmeasurement was done). This is natural, since quantum measurements generally do perturb the state of the measured\nsystem. Hence (2.5) selects only those situations, where this perturbation is seemingly absent.\nAny time-ordered sequence of events defines a history. A set of histories satisfying (2.5) is called a consistent\nhistories set. Due to (2.5), the overall probability of the consistent histories sums to one.\nIn effect (2.5) forbids superpositions; hence, it is called decoherence condition [231, 232, 233]. One notes that\n(2.5) is sufficient, but not necessary for deriving (2.6). Hence, certain weaker conditions instead of (2.5) were also\nstudied [229], but generally they do not satisfy the straightforward statistical independence conditions (independently\nevolving systems have independent probabilities) [236].\nIt was however noted that the consistent histories approach can produce predictions at variance with the measurement based quantum mechanics [235]. The simplest example of such a situation is given in [237]. Consider a quantum\nsystem with zero Hamiltonian in the pure initial state\n1\nρ = |φihφ|, |φi = √ [|a1 i + |a2 i + |a3 i],\n3\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere the vectors {|ak i}3k=1 are orthonormal: hak |ak0 i = δkk0 . Define a two-event history with projectors\n{Π1 (t1 ) = |a1 iha1 |, Π2 (t1 ) = 1 − |a1 iha1 |} and {Π1 (t2 ) = |ψihψ|, Π2 (t2 ) = 1 − |ψihψ|}, t2 > t1 ,\n\n(2.8)\n\n1\n|ψi = √ [|a1 i + |a2 i − |a3 i].\n3\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere\n\nThis history is consistent, since conditions (2.5) hold due to hφ|ψi = hφ|a1 iha1 |ψi = 31 . One now calculates\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\npt1 ,t2 [a1 , ψ] = tr Π1 (t2 )Π1 (t1 )ρΠ1 (t1 )Π1 (t2 ) = hψ|a1 iha1 |φihφ|a1 iha1 |ψi = ,\n9\n\n(2.10)\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\npt2 [ψ] = tr Π1 (t2 )ρΠ1 (t2 ) = |hψ|φi|2 = .\n9\n\n(2.11)\n\nGiven two probabilities (2.10) and (2.11) one can calculate the following conditional probability:\npt1 |t2 [a1 |ψ] =\n\npt1 ,t2 [a1 , ψ]\n= 1.\npt2 [ψ]\n\n(2.12)\n\nYet another two-event consistent history is defined with projectors\ne1 (t1 ) = |a2 iha2 |, Π\ne2 (t1 ) = 1 − |a2 iha2 |} and {Π1 (t2 ) = |ψihψ|, Π2 (t2 ) = 1 − |ψihψ|}, t2 > t1 .\n{Π\n\n(2.13)\n\nComparing (2.13) with (2.8) we note that the first measurement at t1 is different, i.e. it refers to measuring a different\nphysical observable. Analogously to (2.12) we calculate for the second consistent history\npt1 |t2 [a2 |ψ] = 1.\n\n(2.14)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n37\n\nThe consistent histories (2.8) and (2.13) share one event, ψ, at the later time. On the basis of this event (2.12) retrodicts\nwith probability one (i.e., with certainty) that a1 happened. Likewise, (2.14) retrodicts with certainty that a2 happened.\nBut the events a1 and a2 are mutually incompatible, since their projectors are orthogonal, ha1 |a2 i = 0: if one happened,\nthe other one could not happen.\nNote that such an inconsistency is excluded within the measurement-based approach. There the analogues of (2.12)\nand (2.14) refer to different contexts [different measurements]: they read, respectively, p[a1 |ψ, M(t1 ), M(t2 )] = 1 and\nf 1 ), M(t2 )] = 1. It is not surprising that different contexts, M(t1 ) , M(t\nf 1 ), force conditional probabilities\np[a2 |ψ, M(t\nto retrodict incompatible events. Naturally, if within the standard approach one makes the same measurements the\nincompatible events cannot happen, e.g. p[a1 |ψ, M(t1 ), M(t2 )] × p[a2 |ψ, M(t1 ), M(t2 )] = 0, because the second\nprobability is zero.\nFollowing Kent [235] we interpret this effect as a disagreement between the predictions (or more precisely: the\nretrodictions) of the consistent history approach versus those of the measurement-based quantum mechanics. In\nresponse to Kent, Griffiths and Hartle suggested that for avoiding above paradoxes, predictions and retrodictions of\nthe approach are to be restricted to a single consistent history [237, 238]. Conceptually, this seems to betray the\nvery point of the approach, because in effect it brings back the necessity of fixing the context within which a given\nconsistent history takes place. And what fixes this context, once measurements are absent?\nAnother possible opinion is that condition (2.5) is not strong enough to prevent a disagreement with the measurement based approach, and one should look for a better condition for defining events [239, 240]. To our knowledge,\nsuch a condition is so far not found. Bassi and Ghirardi [241] pointed out another logical problem with the consistent\nhistories approach. This produced another debate on the logical consistency of the approach [242, 243], which we\nwill not discuss here.\nWe hold the opinion that in spite of being certainly thought-provoking and interesting, the consistent histories\napproach, as it presently stands, cannot be a substitute for the theory of quantum measurements: Both conceptually\nand practically we still need to understand what is going on in realistic measurements, with their imperfections, and\nwhat are the perturbations induced on the system by its interaction with a measuring apparatus.\n2.10. What we learned from these models\n32\n\nԵրկու երնեկ մի տեղ չեն լինում:\nArmenian proverb\nEach one of the above models enlightens one or another among the many aspects of quantum measurements.\nHowever, none of them reproduces the whole set of desired features: truncation and reduction of S + A, Born’s rule,\nuniqueness of the outcome of a single process, complete scenario of the joint evolution of S + A, with an evaluation of\nits characteristic times, metastability of the initial state of A, amplification within A of the signal, unbiased and robust\nregistration by A in the final state, accurate establishment between S and the pointer variable of A of the correlations\nthat characterize an ideal measurement, influence of the parameters of the model on possible imperfections of the\nmeasurement. In particular, permanent registration requires the pointer to be macroscopic. In the following we\nstudy in detail a model, introduced in Refs. [68, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249], which encompasses these various\nrequirements, and we extend the model in section 11.\n\n32 Fisherman: “What’s the news from the sea?” Fish: “I have a lot to say, but my mouth is full of water”\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n38\n\n3. A Curie–Weiss model for quantum measurements\nLa vie humble aux travaux ennuyeux et faciles\nEst une oeuvre de choix qui veut beaucoup d’amour33\nPaul Verlaine, Sagesse\nIn this section we describe the model for a quantum measurement that was introduced by us in Ref. [68].\n3.1. General features\nPerseverance can reduce an iron rod to a sewing needle\nChinese proverb\nWe take for S, the system to be measured, the simplest quantum system, namely a spin 21 (or any two-level system).\nThe observable ŝ to be measured is its third Pauli matrix ŝz = diag(1, −1), with eigenvalues si equal to ±1. The statistics\nof this observable should not change significantly during the measurement process [4, 13, 76]. Hence ŝz should be\nconservative, i.e., should commute with the Hamiltonian of S + A, at least nearly.\nWe have stressed at the end of § 1.2.1 that the apparatus A should lie initially in a metastable state [250, 251], and\nfinally in either one of several possible stable states (see section 2 for other models of this type). This suggests to take\nfor A, as in several models described in section 2, a quantum system that may undergo a phase transition with broken\ninvariance. The initial state R̂ (0) of A is the metastable phase with unbroken invariance. The states R̂i represent the\nstable phases with broken invariance, in each of which registration can be permanent. The symmetry between the\noutcomes prevents any bias.\nHere we need two such stable states, in one–to–one correspondence with the two eigenvalues si of ŝz . The simplest\nsystem which satisfies these properties is an Ising model [251]. Conciliating mathematical tractability and realistic\nfeatures, we thus take as apparatus A = M + B, a model that simulates a magnetic dot: The magnetic degrees of\nfreedom M consist of N \u001d 1 spins with Pauli operators σ̂(n)\na (n = 1, 2, · · · , N; a = x, y, z), which read for each n\nσ̂ x =\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n!\n,\n\nσ̂y =\n\n0\ni\n\n−i\n0\n\n!\n,\n\nσ̂z =\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n−1\n\n!\n,\n\nσ̂0 =\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n!\n,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere σ̂0 is the corresponding identity matrix; σ̂ = (σ̂ x , σ̂y , σ̂z ) denotes the vector spin operator. The non-magnetic\ndegrees of freedom such as phonons behave as a thermal bath B (Fig. 3.1). Anisotropic interactions between these\nspins can generate Ising ferromagnetism below the Curie temperature T c . As pointer variable Â we take the order\nparameter, which is the magnetization in the z-direction (within normalization), as represented by the quantum observable34\nN\n\nm̂ =\n\n1 X (n)\nσ̂ .\nN n=1 z\n\n(3.2)\n\nWe let N remain finite, which will allow us to keep control of the equations of motion. It should however be sufficiently\nlarge so as to ensure the required properties of phase transitions: The relaxation from R̂(0) to either one of the two\nstates R̂i , at the temperature T (below T c ) imposed by the bath B,√should be irreversible, the fluctuations of the order\nparameter m̂ in each equilibrium state R̂i should be weak (as 1/ N), and the transition between these two states R̂i\nshould be nearly forbidden.\nThe initial state R̂ (0) of A is the metastable paramagnetic state. We expect the final state (1.7) of S + A to involve\nfor A the two stable ferromagnetic states R̂i , i = ↑ or ↓, that we denote as R̂⇑ or R̂⇓ , respectively35 . The equilibrium\ntemperature T will be imposed to M by the phonon bath [197, 121] through weak coupling between the magnetic and\nnon-magnetic degrees of freedom. Within small fluctuations, the order parameter (3.2) vanishes in R̂ (0) and takes two\n33 Humble life devoted to boring and easy tasks / Is a select achievement which demands much love\n\n0\n34 More explicitly, the definition should involve the σ(n ) for n0 , n.

The Hamiltonian\nI ask not for a lighter burden,\nbut for broader shoulders\nJewish proverb\nThe full Hamiltonian can be decomposed into terms associated with the system, with the apparatus and with their\ncoupling:\nĤ = ĤS + ĤSA + ĤA .\n(3.3)\n3.2.1. The system\nA system that works is worth gold\nIcelandic Proverb\nTextbooks treat measurements as instantaneous, which is an idealization. If they are at least very fast, the tested\nsystem will hardly undergo dynamics by its own, so the tested quantity ŝ is practically constant. As indicated above,\nfor an ideal measurement the observable ŝ should commute with Ĥ [13, 181, 76]. The simplest self-Hamiltonian that\nensures this property (no evolution of S without coupling to A), is a constant one, which is equivalent to the trivial\none (since one may always add a constant to the energy)37 ,\nĤS = 0.\n\n(3.4)\n\nThis commutation is required for ideal measurements, during the process of which the statistics of the tested observable should not be affected. More generally, in order to describe an imperfect measurement where ŝ may move\nnoticeably during the measurement (subsection 8.2), we shall introduce there a magnetic field acting on the tested\nspin.\nThe coupling between the tested system and the apparatus,\nĤSA = −g ŝz\n\nN\nX\n\nσ̂(n)\nz = −Ng ŝz m̂,\n\n(3.5)\n\nn=1\n\nhas the usual form of a spin-spin coupling in the z-direction [251], and the constant g > 0 characterizes its strength.\nAs wished, it commutes with ŝz . We have assumed that the range of the interaction between the spin S and the N spins\nof M is large compared to the size of the magnetic dot, so that we can disregard the space-dependence of the coupling.\nThe occurrence of the factor N in (3.5) should not worry us, since we will not take the thermodynamic limit N → ∞.\nAlthough sufficiently large to ensure the existence of a clear phase transition, N is finite. We shall resume in § 9.4 the\nconditions that N should satisfy. In a realistic setting, the interaction between S and M would first be turned on, then\nturned off continuously, while the tested spin approaches the dot then moves away. For simplicity we assume ĤSA to\nbe turned on suddenly at the initial time t = 0, and it will be turned off at a final time tf , as we discuss below38 .\n3.2.2. The magnet\nThe apparatus A consists, as indicated above, of a magnet M and a phonon bath B (Fig. 3.1), and its Hamiltonian\ncan be decomposed into\n36 Note that the values A = ±m , which we wish to come out associated with the eigenvalues s = ±1, are determined from equilibrium statistical\ni\nF\ni\nmechanics; they are not the eigenvalues\n√ of Â ≡ m̂, which range from −1 to +1 with spacing 2/N, but thermodynamic expectation values around\nwhich small fluctuations of order 1/ N occur.

The system S is a spin- 12 ŝ. The apparatus A includes a magnet M and a\nbath B. The magnet, which acts as a pointer, consists of N spins- 12 coupled to one another through an Ising interaction J. The phonon bath B is\ncharacterized by its temperature T and a Debye cutoff Γ. It interacts with M through a spin-boson coupling γ. The process is triggered by the\ninteraction g between the measured observable ŝz and the pointer variable, the magnetization per spin, m̂, of the pointer.\n\nĤA = ĤM + ĤB + ĤMB .\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe magnetic part is chosen as [252]\nĤM = −N\n\nX\nq=2,4\n\nJq\n\nm̂q\nm̂2\nm̂4\n= −N J2\n− N J4 ,\nq\n2\n4\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere the magnetization operator m̂ was defined by (3.2). It couples all q-plets of spins σ̂(n) symmetrically, with\nthe same coupling constant Jq N 1−q for each q-plet. (The factor N 1−q is introduced only for convenience.) The\nspace-independence of this coupling is fairly realistic for a small magnetic dot, as in (3.5). The interaction is fully\nanisotropic, involving only the z-components. The exponents q are even in order to ensure the up-down symmetry of\nthe apparatus. The q = 2 term is a standard spin-spin interaction. The term q = 4 describes so-called super-exchange\ninteractions as realized for metamagnets [252]. We shall only consider ferromagnetic interactions (J2 > 0 or J4 > 0\nor both).\nWe will see in § 3.3.4 that the Hamiltonian (3.6) produces a paramagnetic equilibrium state at high temperature\nand two ferromagnetic states at low temperature, with a transition of second order for J2 > 3J4 , of first order for\n3J4 > J2 . The former case is exemplified by the Curie–Weiss Ising model for an anisotropic magnetic dot [251], with\n(p)\npairwise interactions in σ̂(n)\nz σ̂z , recovered here for J4 = 0,\nĤM = −\n\nN\nJ2 N 2\nJ2 X (i) ( j)\nσ̂ σ̂z ,\nm̂ = −\n2\n2N i, j=1 z\n\n(q = 2).\n\n(3.8)\n\nLikewise, the first-order case is exemplified by letting J2 = 0, keeping in (3.6) only the quartic “super-exchange”\nterm:\nĤM = −\n\nN\nJ4 N 4\nJ4 X (i) ( j) (k) (l)\nm̂ = − 3\nσ̂ σ̂z σ̂z σ̂z ,\n4\n4N i, j,k,l=1 z\n\n(q = 4).\n\n(3.9)\n\nThe more physical case (3.6) of mixtures of q = 2 and q = 4 terms will not differ qualitatively from either one\nof the two pure cases q = 2 or q = 4. It will therefore be sufficient for our purpose, in section 7, to illustrate the two\nsituations J2 > 3J4 and J2 < 3J4 by working out the Hamiltonians (3.8) and (3.9), respectively. We may summarize\nthese two cases by HM = −(N J/q)m̂q with q = 2 or 4, respectively.\nUsing A as a measurement apparatus requires the lifetime of the initial state to be larger than the overall measurement time. An advantage of a first-order transition is the local stability of the paramagnetic state, even below the\ntransition temperature, which ensures a much larger lifetime as in the case of a second order transition. We shall see,\nhowever (§ 7.3.2), that the required condition can be satisfied even for q = 2 alone (i.e., for J4 = 0).\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n41\n\n3.2.3. The phonon bath\nIt is not only one person who bathes in the witch’s water\nGhanaian Proverb\nThe interaction between the magnet and the bath, which drives the apparatus to equilibrium, is taken as a standard\nspin-boson Hamiltonian [197, 121, 122]\nĤMB =\n\nN\nN X\n\u0011 √ X\n√ X \u0010 (n) (n)\n(n)\n(n) (n)\n(n)\nσ̂ x B̂x + σ̂(n)\nB̂\n+\nσ̂\nB̂\n≡\nσ̂(n)\nγ\nγ\ny\ny\nz\nz\na B̂a ,\n\n(3.10)\n\nn=1 a=x,y,z\n\nn=1\n\nwhich couples each component a = x, y, z of each spin σ̂(n) with some hermitean linear combination B̂(n)\na of phonon\noperators. The dimensionless constant γ \u001c 1 characterizes the strength of the thermal coupling between M and B,\nwhich is weak.\nFor simplicity, we require that the bath acts independently for each spin degree of freedom n, a. (The so-called\nindependent baths approximation.) This can be achieved (i) by introducing Debye phonon modes labelled by the pair\nof indices k, l, with eigenfrequencies ωk depending only on k, so that the bath Hamiltonian is\nX\nĤB =\n~ωk b̂†k,l b̂k,l ,\n(3.11)\nk,l\n\nand (ii) by assuming that the coefficients C in\nXh\ni\nB̂(n)\nC (n, a; k, l) b̂k,l + C ∗ (n, a; k, l) b̂†k,l\na =\n\n(3.12)\n\nk,l\n\nare such that\n\nX\n\nC (n, a; k, l) C ∗ (m, b; k, l) = δn,m δa,b c (ωk ) .\n\n(3.13)\n\nl\n\nThis requires the number of values of the index l to be at least equal to 3N. For instance, we may associate with each\ncomponent a of each spin σ̂(n) a different set of phonon modes, labelled by k, n, a, identifying l as (n, a), and thus\ndefine ĤB and B̂(n)\na as\nĤB\n\n=\n\nN X X\nX\n\n(n)\n~ωk b̂†(n)\nk,a b̂k,a ,\n\n(3.14)\n\n\u0010 (n)\n\u0011\nc (ωk ) b̂k,a\n+ b̂†(n)\nk,a .\n\n(3.15)\n\nn=1 a=x,y,z k\n\nB̂(n)\na\n\n=\n\nXp\nk\n\nWe shall see in § 3.3.2 that the various choices of the phonon set, of the spectrum (3.11) and of the operators (3.12)\ncoupled to the spins are equivalent, in the sense that the joint dynamics of S + M will depend only on the spectrum ωk\nand on the coefficients c (ωk ).\nThe spin-boson coupling (3.10) between M and B will be sufficient for our purpose up to section 9. This interaction, of the Glauber type, does not commute with ĤM , a property needed for registration, since M has to release\nenergy when relaxing from its initial metastable paramagnetic state to one of its final stable ferromagnetic states at\nthe temperature T . However, the complete solution of the measurement problem presented in section 11 will require\nmore complicated interactions. We will therefore introduce in § 11.2.4 a small but random coupling between the spins\nof M, and in § 11.2.5 a more realistic small coupling between M and B, of the Suzuki type, which produces flip-flops\nof the spins of M without changing the value of the energy that M would have with only the terms (3.8) and/or (3.9).\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n42\nA\n\n$\nS r̂ %\n\nD̂\nM R̂M\nD̂\nR̂\n\nB R̂B\n\nS\n\nM\n\nB\n\ng\n\nγ\n\nN, J\n\nT, Γ\n\nFigure 3.2: Notations for the density operators of the system S + A and the subsystems M and B of A.

It will be convenient to define through partial traces, at any instant t, the following marginal density operators:\nr̂ for the tested system S, R̂ for the apparatus A, R̂M for the magnet M, R̂B for the bath, and D̂ for S + M after\nelimination of the bath (as depicted schematically in Fig. 3.2), according to\nr̂ = trA D̂,\n\nR̂ = trS D̂,\n\nR̂M = trB R̂ = trS,B D̂,\n\nR̂B = trS, M D̂,\n\nD̂ = trB D̂.\n\n(3.16)\n\nThe expectation value of any observable Â pertaining, for instance, to the subsystem S + M of S + A (including\nproducts of spin operators ŝa and σ̂(n)\na ) can equivalently be evaluated as h Âi = trS +A D̂ Â or as h Âi = trS +M D̂ Â.\nAs indicated in subsection 1.2, the apparatus A is a large system, treated by methods of statistical mechanics,\nwhile we need to follow in detail the microscopic degrees of freedom of the system S and their correlations with A.\nTo this aim, we shall analyze the full state D̂ of the system into several sectors, characterized by the eigenvalues of ŝz .\nNamely, in the two-dimensional eigenbasis of ŝz for S, |↑i, |↓i, with eigenvalues si = +1 for i =↑ and si = −1 for i =↓,\nD̂ can be decomposed into the four blocks\n!\nR̂↑↑ R̂↑↓\nD̂ =\n,\n(3.17)\nR̂↓↑ R̂↓↓\nwhere each R̂i j is an operator in the space of the apparatus.

Indeed, we are not interested in the\nevolution of the bath variables, and we shall eliminate B by relying on the weakness of its coupling (3.10) with M.\nThe operators R̂i j code our full statistical information about S and M. We shall use the notation R̂i j whenever we refer\nto S + M and R̂M when referring to M alone. Tracing also over M, we are, according to (3.16), left with\n!\nr↑↑ r↑↓\nr̂ =\n= r↑↑ |↑ih↑| + r↑↓ |↑ih↓| + r↓↑ |↓ih↑| + r↓↓ |↓ih↓|.\n(3.19)\nr↓↑ r↓↓\nThe magnet M is thus described by R̂M = R̂↑↑ + R̂↓↓ , the system S alone by the matrix elements ri j = trM R̂i j of r̂. The\ncorrelations of ŝz , ŝ x or ŝy with any function of the observables σ̂(n)\na (a = x, y, z , n = 1 , . . . N) are represented by\nR̂↑↑ − R̂↓↓ , R̂↑↓ + R̂↓↑ , iR̂↑↓ − iR̂↓↑ , respectively. The operators R̂↑↑ and R̂↓↓ are hermitean positive, but not normalized,\nwhereas R̂↓↑ = R̂†↑↓ .

The Born rule then predicts that p↑ = trS r̂(0)Π↑ = r↑↑ (0) and p↓ = r↓↓ (0).\nSince no off-diagonal terms occur in (3.21), a point that we wish to explain, and since we expect B to remain\nnearly in its initial equilibrium state, we may trace out the bath, as is standard in classical and quantum thermal\nphysics, without losing significant information. It will therefore be sufficient for our purpose to show that the final\nstate is\n!\np↑ R̂M⇑\n0\nD̂(tf ) =\n= p↑ |↑ih↑| ⊗ R̂M⇑ + p↓ |↓ih↓| ⊗ R̂M⇓ ,\n(3.22)\n0\np↓ R̂M⇓\nnow referring to the magnet M and tested spin S alone.\nReturning to Eq.

We can also derive it from the expressions (3.11) for ĤB , (3.12)\nand (3.35) for B̂(n)\na (t), and (3.33) for R̂B (0), which under general conditions provide a universal model for the bath\n[197, 121, 122]. Indeed, by inserting these expressions into the left-hand side of (3.34), we recover the diagonal\nform of the right-hand side owing to (3.13), which relates c(ω) to the bath Hamiltonian ĤB , with the autocorrelation\nfunction K (t) given by\nK̃ (ω) =\n\nK (t) =\n=\n\n!\neiωk t\ne−iωk t\nc (ωk ) β~ω\n+\ne k − 1 1 − e−β~ωk\nk\n!\nZ ∞\ne−iωt\neiωt\n+\ndω ρ (ω) c (ω) β~ω\n.\ne\n− 1 1 − e−β~ω\n0\nX\n\nWe have expressed above K (t) in terms of the density of modes\nX\nρ (ω) =\nδ (ω − ωk ) ,\n\n(3.39)\n\n(3.40)\n\nk\n\nand this provides\nK̃ (ω) = 2πρ (|ω|) c (|ω|)\n\nsgn ω\neβ~ω − 1\n\n.\n\nIn agreement with Kubo’s relation, we also find for the dissipative response\nZ +∞\nn\nio\nh\n(p)\ndte−iωt trB R̂B (0) B̂(n)\na (t) , B̂b (0) = −2πρ (|ω|) c (|ω|) sgn ω.\n\n(3.41)\n\n(3.42)\n\n−∞\n\nIn the limit of a spectrum ωk of the phonon modes sufficiently dense so that the relevant values of t/~ and β are small\ncompared to the inverse level spacing of the phonon modes, we can regard ρ (ω) c (ω) as a continuous function.

As justified below, we take for it the factorized form\nR̂ (0) = R̂M (0) ⊗ R̂B (0) ,\n\n(3.45)\n\nwhere the bath is in the equilibrium state (3.33), at the temperature T = 1/β lower than the transition temperature of\nM, while the magnet with Hamiltonian (3.6) is in a paramagnetic equilibrium state at a temperature T 0 = 1/β0 higher\nthan its transition temperature:\n1 −β0 ĤM\ne\n.\n(3.46)\nR̂M (0) =\nZM\nHow can the apparatus be actually initialized in the non-equilibrium state (3.45) at the time t = 0? This initialization takes place during the time interval −τinit < t < 0. The apparatus is first set at earlier times into equilibrium at the temperature T 0 . Due to the smallness of γ, its density operator is then factorized and proportional to\nexp[−β0 (ĤM + ĤB )]. At the time −τinit the phonon bath is suddenly cooled down to T . We shall evaluate in § 7.3.2\nthe relaxation time of M towards its equilibrium ferromagnetic states under the effect of B at the temperature T . Due\nto the weakness of the coupling γ, this time turns out to be much longer than the duration of the experiment. We can\nsafely assume τinit to be much shorter than this relaxation time so that M remains unaffected by the cooling. On the\nother hand, the quasi continuous nature of the spectrum of B can allow the phonon-phonon interactions (which we\nhave disregarded when writing (3.11)) to establish the equilibrium of B at the temperature T within a time shorter\nthan τinit . It is thus realistic to imagine an initial state of the form (3.45).\nAn alternative method of initialization consists in applying to the magnetic dot a strong radiofrequency field,\nwhich acts on M but not on B. The bath can thus be thermalized at the required temperature, lower than the transition\ntemperature of M, while the populations of spins of M oriented in either direction are equalized. The magnet is then\nin a paramagnetic state, as if it were thermalized at an infinite temperature T 0 in spite of the presence of a cold bath.\nIn that case we have the initial state (see Eq.

Ferromagnetic equilibrium states of the magnet\nJe suis seul ce soir avec mes rêves\nJe suis seul ce soir sans ton amour41\nLyrics by Rose Noël and Jean Casanova, music by Paul Durand, sung by André Claveau\nWe expect the final state (1.7) of S + A after measurement to involve the two ferromagnetic equilibrium states R̂i ,\ni = ⇑ or ⇓. As above these states R̂i of the apparatus factorize, in the weak coupling limit (γ \u001c 1), into the product\nof (3.33) for the bath and a ferromagnetic equilibrium state R̂Mi for the magnet M. It is tempting to tackle broken\ninvariance by means of the mean-field approximation, which becomes exact at equilibrium for infinite N owing to\nthe long range of the interactions [251, 252]. However, we are interested in a finite, though large, value of N, and\nthe probability distribution PMi (m) associated with R̂Mi has a significant width around the mean-field value for m.\nMoreover, we shall see in subsection 7.3 that, in spite of the constancy of the interaction between all spins, the\ntime-dependent mean-field approximation may fail even for large N. We will study there the dynamics of the whole\ndistribution PM (m, t) including the final regime where it is expected to tend to PM⇑ (m) or PM⇓ (m), and will determine\nin particular the lifetime of the metastable state (3.45). We focus here on equilibrium only.

The distribution (3.54)\ndisplays narrow peaks at the minima of F (m), and the equilibrium free energy −T ln ZM is equal for large N to the\nabsolute minimum of (3.55).

The possible values of m are dense within the peak, with equal spacing δm = 2/N. With each such peak\nPMi (m) is associated through (3.26), (3.27) a density operator R̂i of the magnet M which may describe a locally stable\nequilibrium. Depending on the values of J2 and J4 and on the temperature, there may exist one, two or three such\nlocally stable states. We note the corresponding average magnetizations mi , for arbitrary h, as mP for a paramagnetic\nstate and as m⇑ and m⇓ for the ferromagnetic states, with m⇑ > 0, m⇓ < 0. We also note as ±mF the ferromagnetic\nmagnetizations for h = 0. When h tends to 0 (as happens at the end of the measurement where we set g → 0), mP\ntends to 0, m⇑ to +mF and m⇓ to −mF , namely\nm⇑ (h > 0) > 0,\n\nm⇓ (h > 0) < 0,\n\nm⇑ (−h) = −m⇓ (h),\n\nmF = m⇑ (h → +0) = −m⇓ (h → +0).\n\n(3.58)\n\nFor h = 0, the system M is invariant under change of sign of m [251]. This invariance is spontaneously broken\nbelow some temperature [251]. In the case q = 2 of the Ising interaction (3.8), there is above the Curie temperature\nT c = J2 a single paramagnetic peak PM0 (m) at mP = 0, given by (3.49), (3.52), and for T < J2 two symmetric\nferromagnetic peaks (3.57), i = ⇑ or ⇓, at the points m⇑ = mF and m⇓ = −mF , given by mF = tanh βJ2 mF .

This condition is satisfied for large N\nand βJ2 − 1 finite; near βJ2 = 1, where m2F ∼ 3 (βJ2 − 1), the two states R̂⇑ and R̂⇓ still have no overlap as soon as the\ntemperature differs significantly from the critical temperature, as\n1\nJ2 − T\n√ .\nT\n3N\n\n(3.60)\n\nThis property is needed to ensure a faithful registration by M of the measurement. Little is changed for the Hamiltonian\n(3.7) with J4 > 0 but still J2 > 3J4 .\nStill for h = 0, but in the case 3J4 > J2 of a first-order transition, F (m) has a minimum at m = 0 if T > J2\nand hence (3.54) has there a peak as (3.51) at m = 0 whatever the temperature, see Fig. 3.3. For the pure quartic\ninteraction of Eq. (3.9), the two additional ferromagnetic peaks PM⇑ (m) and PM⇓ (m) appear around m⇑ = mF = 0.889\nand m⇓ = −mF when the temperature T goes below 0.496J4 . As T decreases, mF given by mF = tanh βJ4 m3F increases\nand the value of the minimum F (mF ) decreases; the weight (3.54) is transferred from PM0 (m) to PM⇑ (m) and PM⇓ (m).\nA first-order transition occurs when F (mF ) = F (0), for T c = 0.363J4 and mF = 0.9906, from the paramagnetic to the\ntwo ferromagnetic states, although the paramagnetic state remains locally stable. The spontaneous magnetization mF\nis always very close to 1, behaving as 1 − mF ∼ 2 exp(−2J4 /T ).\nFor the general Hamiltonian (3.7), it is a simple exercise to study the cross-over between first and second-order\ntransitions, which takes place for mi \u001c 1. To this aim, the free energy (3.55) is expanded as\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n49\n\nFNT\nT = 0.5 J\n-0.55\n0.4 J\n\n-0.65\n\n0.35 J\n-0.75\n0.2 J\n-1\n\n0.3 J\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n1\n\nm\n\nFigure 3.3: The free energy F in units of NT for a pure quartic interaction (eq.

This approximation holds for |T − J2 | \u001c J2 ,\n|3J4 − J2 | \u001c J2 . For J2 > 3J4 , the second-order transition takes place at T c = J2 whatever J4 . For 3J4 > J2 , the\nfirst-order transition temperature T c is given by T c − J2 ∼ 5(3J4 − J2 )2 /48J2 , and the equilibrium magnetization jumps\nfrom 0 to ±mF , with m2F ∼ 5(3J4 − J2 )/4J2 . The paramagnetic state is locally stable down to T > J2 , the ferromagnetic\nstates up to T − J2 < (4/3)(T c − J2 ). When 3J4 > J2 , a metastability with a long lifetime of the paramagnetic state is\nthus ensured if the bath temperature satisfies T c > T > J2 .\nStrictly speaking, the canonical equilibrium state of M below the transition temperature, characterized by (3.54),\nhas for h = 0 and finite N the form\nR̂Meq =\n\n1\n(R̂M⇑ + R̂M⇓ ).\n2\n\n(3.62)\n\nHowever this state is not necessarily the one reached at the end of a relaxation process governed by the bath B, when\na field h, even weak, is present: this field acts as a source which breaks the invariance. The determination of the\nstate R̂M (tf ) reached at the end of a relaxation process involving the thermal bath B and a weak field h requires a\ndynamical study which will be worked out in subsection 7.3. This is related to the ergodicity breaking: if a weak field\nis applied, then switched off, the full canonical state (3.62) is still recovered, but only after an unrealistically long time\n(for N \u001d 1). For finite times the equilibrium state of the magnet is to be found by restricting the full canonical state\n(3.62) to its component having a magnetization with the definite sign determined by the weak external field. This\nis the essence of the spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, for our situation this well-known recipe should be\nsupported by dynamical considerations; see in this respect section 11.\nIn our model of measurement, the situation is similar, though slightly more complicated. The system-apparatus\ncoupling (3.5) plays the rôle of an operator-valued source, with eigenvalues behaving as a field h = g or h = −g. We\nshall determine in section 7 towards which state M is driven under the conjugate action of the bath B and of the system\nS, depending on the parameters of the model.\nAs a preliminary step, let us examine here the effect on the free energy (3.55) of a small positive field h. Consider\nfirst the minima of F (m) [250, 251]. The two ferromagnetic minima m⇑ and m⇓ given by (3.56) are slightly shifted\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0003\naway from mF and −mF , and F m⇑ − F (mF ) behaves as −NhmF . Hence, as soon as exp{−β F m⇑ − F m⇓ } ∼\nexp(2βNhmF ) \u001d 1, only the single peak PM⇑ (m) around m⇑ ' mF contributes to (3.54), so that the canonical equilibrium state of M has the form R̂Meq = R̂M⇑ . The shape of F (m) will also be relevant for the dynamics. For\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n50\n\nFNT\n-0.55\n\nh=0\n-0.65\n0.02 J\n0.04 J\n-0.5\n\n-0.25\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\nm\n\nFigure 3.4: The effect of a positive field h on F(m) for q = 4 at temperature T = 0.2J4 . As h increases the paramagnetic minimum mP shifts\ntowards positive m. At the critical field hc = 0.0357J4 this local minimum disappears, and the curve has an inflexion point with vanishing slope at\nm = mc = 0.268. For larger fields, like in the displayed case g = 0.04J4 , the locally stable paramagnetic state disappears, and there remain only the\ntwo ferromagnetic states, the most stable one with positive magnetization m⇑ ' 1 and the metastable one with negative magnetization m⇓ ' −1.\n\na second order transition, although F (m) has when h = 0 a maximum at m = 0, its stationarity allows the state\nR̂M (m, 0) ∝ PM (m̂, 0) given by (3.49) to have a long lifetime for N \u001d 1. The introduction of h produces a negative\nslope −Nh at m = 0, which suggests that the dynamics will let hmi increase. For a first order transition, the situation is\ndifferent (Fig. 3.4). If h is sufficiently small, F (m) retains its paramagnetic minimum, the position of which is shifted\nas mP ∼ h/T ; the paramagnetic state R̂M (0) remains locally stable. It may decay towards a stable ferromagnetic state\nonly through mechanisms of thermal activation or quantum tunneling, processes with very large characteristic times,\nof exponential order in N. However, there is a threshold hc above which this paramagnetic minimum of F (m), which\nthen lies at m = mc , disappears. The value of hc is found by eliminating m = mc between the equations d2 F/dm2 = 0\nand dF/dm √= 0. In the pure q = 4 case (J2 = 0) on which we focus as an illustration for first order transitions, we find\n2m2c = 1 − 1 − 4T/3J4 , hc = 12 T ln[(1 + mc )/(1 − mc )] − J4 m3c . At the transition temperature T c = 0.363J4 , we have\nm\n4 ; for T = 0.2J4 , we obtain mc = 0.268 and hc = 0.036J4 ; for T \u001c J4 , mc behaves as\n√c = 0.375 and hcp= 0.0904J\nT/3J4 and hc as 4T 3 /27J4 . Provided h > hc , F (m) has now a negative slope in the whole interval 0 < m < mF .\nWe can thus expect, in our measurement problem, that the registration will take place in a reasonable delay, either\nfor a first order transition if the coupling g is larger than hc , or for a second order transition. In the latter case, it will\nbe necessary to check, however, that the lifetime of the initial state is larger than the duration of the measurement.\nThis will be done in § 7.3.2.\n4. Equations of motion\nΤὰ πάντα ῥεı̈43\nQuoted from Heraklitos by Plato and Simplicius\nIn this technical section, we rewrite the dynamical equations for our model in a form which will help us, in the\ncontinuation, to discuss the physical features of the solution. We will make no other approximation than the weak\nspin-phonon coupling, γ \u001c 1, and will derive the equations up to first order in γ. In subsection 4.5, we take advantage\nof the large size of the apparatus, N \u001d 1, to reduce the equations of motion into a pair of partial differential equations.\n\n43 Everything flows\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n51\n\n4.1.

This implies that the diagonal elements\nof the density matrix of the spin are conserved, viz. r↑↑ (tf ) = r↑↑ (t) = r↑↑ (0) and r↓↓ (tf ) = r↓↓ (0). The result is\nconsistent with Born’s rule: we expect the probabilities for the possible outcomes of an ideal measurement to be given\nby the diagonal elements of the initial density matrix of S.

Decoupled equations of motion\nMarried couples tell each other a thousand things,\nwithout speech\nChinese proverb\nIn our model, the Hamiltonian commutes with the measured observable ŝz , hence with the projection operators\nΠ̂i onto the states |↑i and |↓i of S. The equations for the operators Π̂i D̂Π̂ j are therefore decoupled. We can replace\nthe equation (4.5) for D̂ in the Hilbert space of S + M by a set of four equations for the operators R̂i j defined by\n(3.18) in the Hilbert space of M. We shall later see (section 8.2) that this simplification underlies the ideality of the\nmeasurement process.\nThe Hamiltonian Ĥ0 in the space S + M gives rise to two Hamiltonians Ĥ↑ and Ĥ↓ in the space M, which according\nto (3.5) and (3.7) are simply two functions of the observable m̂, given by\nĤi = Hi (m̂) = −gN si m̂ − N\n\nX Jq\nq\nq=2,4\n\nm̂q ,\n\n(i =↑, ↓)\n\n(4.6)\n\nwith si = +1 (or −1) for i =↑ (or ↓).

We show in Appendix B that\nthis property is preserved for R̂i j (t) by the evolution (4.8), owing to the form (4.6) of Ĥi and in spite of the occurrence\nof the separate operators σ̂(n)\na in the right-hand side.\nWe can therefore parametrize, as anticipated at the end of § 3.3.1, at each t, the operators R̂i j in the form R̂i j =\nPdis\ni j (m̂)/G(m̂). Their equations of motion (4.8) are then diagonal in the eigenspace of m̂, and are therefore equivalent\nto scalar equations which govern the functions Pi j (m) = (N/2)Pdis\ni j (m) of the variable m taking the discrete values\n(3.23).\n4.4.2.

Interpretation as quantum balance equations\nJe moet je evenwicht bewaren46\nDutch expression\nOur basic equations (4.16) and (4.18) fully describe the dynamics of the measurement. The diagonal equation\n(4.16) can be interpreted as a balance equation [197, 121, 122]. Its first term represents elementary processes in which\n(n)\none among the spins, say σ(n) , flips from σ(n)\nz = +1 to σz = −1. For the value m of the magnetization, a value\n1\ntaken with probability P↑↑ (m, t) at the time t, there are 2 N (1 + m) spins pointing upwards, and the probability for\none of these spins to flip down between\n\u0010 \u0011 the times t and t + dt under the effect of the phonon bath can be read off\nfrom (4.16) to be equal to 2γ~−2 K̃t Ω−↑ dt. This process produces a decrease of P↑↑ (m) and it is accounted for by the\nnegative contribution (which arises from the second part of ∆+ and is proportional to −P↑↑ (m, t)) to the first term in the\nright-hand side of (4.16). The coefficient K̃t (ω) depends on the temperature T of the bath B, on the duration t of its\ninteraction with M, and on the energy ~ω that it has transferred to M; this energy is evaluated for P↑↑ (or P↓↓ ) as if the\nspins of M were submitted to an external field +g (or −g). The first term in (4.16) also contains a positive contribution\narising from the same process, for which the magnetization decreases from m + δm to m, thus raising P↑↑ (m) by a term\nproportional to P↑↑ (m + δm). Likewise, the second term in the right-hand side of (4.16) describes the negative and\n(n)\npositive changes of P↑↑ (m) arising from the flip of a single spin from σ(n)\nz = −1 to σz = +1. Quantum mechanics\noccurs in (4.16) through the expression (3.38) of K̃ (ω); the flipping probabilities do not depend on the factor ~, owing\nto the factor ~2 that enters K̃(ω) and the fact that we have chosen the dimensionless coupling constant γ, but their\nquantum nature is still expressed by the Bose-Einstein occupation number.\nThe equation (4.18) for P↑↓ has additional quantum features. Dealing with an off-diagonal block, it involves\nsimultaneously the two Hamiltonians Ĥ↑ and Ĥ↓ of Eq. (4.6) in the Hilbert space of M, through the expression (4.12)\nof Ω±↑,↓ . The quantities P↑↓ and P↓↑ are complex and cannot be interpreted as probabilities, although we recognize in\nP\nP\n(m) = 1 − m Pdis\n(m), or in the\nthe right-hand side the same type of balance as in Eq. (4.16). In fact, while m Pdis\n↑↑\n↓↓\nR\nR\nN \u001d 1 limit dm P↑↑ (m) = 1 − dm P↓↓ (m), remains constant in time because the sum over m of the right-hand side\nP\n(m) from being\nof (4.16) vanishes, the term in the left-hand side of (4.18), which arises from Hi − H j , prevents m Pdis\n↑↓\nconstant; It will, actually, lead to the disappearance of these “Schrödinger cat” terms.\nComparison of the right-hand sides of (4.16) and (4.18) shows moreover that the bath acts in different ways on the\ndiagonal and off-diagonal blocks of the density operator D̂ of S + M.\n4.5. Large N expansion\nExcept in subsection 8.1 we shall deal with a magnetic dot sufficiently large so that N \u001d 1. The set of values\n(3.23) on which the distributions Pi j (m, t) are defined then become dense on the interval −1 ≤ m ≤ +1. At the initial\n√\ntime, Pi j (m, 0), proportional to (3.49), extends over a range of order 1/ N while the spacing of the discrete values\nof m is δm = 2/N. The initial distributions Pi j are thus smooth on the scale δm, and P↑↑ and P↓↓ will remain smooth\nat later times. It is therefore legitimate to interpolate the set of values of the diagonal quantities Pii (m, t) defined at\nthe discrete points (3.23) into a continuous function of m. If we assume the two resulting functions Pii to be several\ntimes differentiable with respect to m, the discrete equation (4.16) satisfied by the original distributions will give rise\nto continuous equations, which we shall derive below, involving an asymptotic expansion in powers of 1/N. Within\nexponentially small corrections, the characteristic functions associated with Pii (m, t) then reduce to integrals:\nZ\nX\niλm\n(m,\nΨii (λ, t) ≡\nPdis\nt)\ne\n=\ndmPii (m, t) eiλm ,\n(4.20)\nii\nm\n\nprovided λ \u001c N. The moments of Pii (m) of order less than N can also be evaluated as integrals.\nHowever, the left-hand side of Eq. (4.18) generates for finite times rapid variations of P↑↓ (m, t) and P↓↑ (m, t) as\nfunctions of m, and it will be necessary in sections 5 and 6 to account for the discrete nature of m. When writing\nbelow the equations of motion for these quantities in the large N limit, we will take care of this difficulty.\nThe differences ∆± defined by (4.15) satisfy\n46 You have to keep your balance\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\u0002\n\u0003\n∆± [ f (m)g(m)] = ∆± f (m) g(m) + f (m) ∆± g(m) + ∆± f (m) ∆± g(m) ,\n\n55\n\n(4.21)\n\nand give rise to derivatives with respect to m according to\n∆± f (m) ≈ ±\n\n2 ∂ f (m)\n2 ∂2 f (m)\n4 ∂3 f (m)\n+ 2\n±\n.\nN ∂m\nN ∂m2\n3N 3 ∂m3\n\nWe can also expand the excitation energies ~Ω±i , defined by (4.12) and (4.6), for large N as\n!\n2 dωi\n1 d\n±\nΩi (m) ≈ ∓2ωi −\n= 1±\n(∓2ωi ),\nN dm\nN dm\n\n(4.22)\n\n(4.23)\n\nwhere we introduced the quantity\n~ωi = −\n\n1 dHi\n= gsi + J2 m + J4 m3 ,\nN dm\n\n(si = ±1),\n\n(4.24)\n\ninterpreted as the effective energy of a single spin of M coupled to the other spins of M and to the tested spin S.\nThe above expansions will allow us to transform, for large N, the equations of motion for Pi j into partial differential\nequations. In case ∂Pi j /∂m is finite for large N, we can simply replace in (4.16) and (4.18) N∆± by ±2∂/∂m and Ω±i\nby ∓2ωi . However, such a situation is exceptional; we shall encounter it only in § 7.3.2. In general Pi j will behave\nfor large N as A exp NB. This property, exhibited at t = 0 in §§ 3.3.3 and 3.3.4, is preserved by the dynamics. As\n∂Pi j /∂t involves leading contributions of orders N and 1, we need to include in the right-hand sides of (4.16) and\n(4.18) contributions of the same two orders. Let us therefore introduce the functions\n\nXi j (m, t) ≡\n\n1 ∂ ln Pi j\n1 ∂Pi j\n=\n,\nN ∂m\nNPi j ∂m\n\n(4.25)\n\nwhich contain parts of order 1 and 1/N, and their derivatives\n\nXi0j ≡\n\n1 ∂2 ln Pi j ∂Xi j\n=\n,\nN ∂m2\n∂m\n\n(4.26)\n\nwhich can be truncated at finite order in N.

The bath term of the equation (4.18) for P↑↓ (m, t) (and for\nP↓↑ = P∗↑↓ ) has a similar form, again obtained from all the terms in (4.21) and (4.27), namely, using the notation\n(4.19):\n\u001a\nh\ni\n∂P↑↓ 2iNgm\n2γ\n−\nP↑↓ ≈ 2 P↑↓ N sinh X↑↓ (1 + m)K̃− (m, t)eX↑↓ − (1 − m)K̃+ (m, t)e−X↑↓\n∂t\n~\n~\n!)\nh\ni\nh\ni\n∂\n1\nX↑↓\nX↑↓\n−X↑↓ ∂\n−X↑↓\n+e\n(1 + m)K̃− (m, t)e\n−e\n(1 − m)K̃+ (m, t)e\n+O\n.\n∂m\n∂m\nN\n\n(4.29)\n\nA further simplification occurs for large N in the diagonal sector. Then P↑↑ , which is real, takes significant values\nonly in the vicinity of the maximum√of ln P↑↑ . This maximum is reached at a point m = μ(t), and P↑↑ is concentrated\nin a√range for |m − μ(t)| of order 1/ N 47 . In this range, X↑↑ is proportional to μ(t) − m, and it is therefore of order\n0\n2\n0\n1/ N 48 . We can therefore expand (4.28) in powers of X↑↑ , noting also that X↑↑\nis finite, and collect the X↑↑ , X↑↑\n, X↑↑\n0\nand X↑↑ X↑↑ terms. Thus, if we disregard the exponentially small tails of the distribution P↑↑ , which do not contribute\nto physical quantities, we find at the considered order, using (4.25) and (4.26),\n∂P↑↑\n\u0003\n\u0003 1 ∂2 \u0002\n∂ \u0002\nw (m, t) P↑↑ ,\n≈\n−v (m, t) P↑↑ +\n2\n∂t\n∂m\nN ∂m\n\n(4.30)\n\nwhere\n!\n\u0001i\n\u0001\n1\n2γ h\n(1\n(1\nK̃\n2ω\n+\nO\nK̃\n−2ω\n−\n+\nm)\n−\nm)\n,\n(4.31)\nt\n↑\nt\n↑\nN\n~2\n!\n\u0001\n\u0001i\n2γ h\n1\n(1\n(1\nK̃\n−\nm)\n−2ω\nK̃\n.\n(4.32)\nw (m, t) =\n+\n+\nm)\n2ω\n+\nO\nt\n↑\nt\n↑\nN\n~2\n√\n0\nThe next contribution to the right hand side of (4.30) would be −2vX↑↑ X↑↑\nP↑↑ , of order 1/ N. We have replaced in v\nand w the frequencies Ω±↑ by ∓2ω↑ , which has the sole effect of shifting the position and width of the distribution P↑↑\nby a quantity of order 1/N. As shown by the original equation (4.28), the two terms of (4.30) have the same order of\nmagnitude (in spite of the presence of the factor 1/N in the second one) when P↑↑ has an exponential form in N. Only\nthe first one contributes if P↑↑ becomes smooth (§ 7.3.2). The equation for P↓↓ is obtained from (4.30) by changing g\ninto −g.\nIn the regime where the registration will take place (§ 7.1.1), we shall be allowed to replace K̃t (±2ωi ) by K̃(±2ωi ),\nwhich according to (3.38) is equal to\nv (m, t) =\n\nK̃(±2ωi ) =\n\n!\n\u0003\n~2 ωi \u0002\n2|ωi |\ncoth(β~ωi ) ∓ 1 exp −\n,\n4\nΓ\n\n(i =↑, ↓).\n\n(4.33)\n\nEqs.

We will work them out in sections 5 to 7.

The left-hand side of (4.29) governs the evolution of the\nnormalization dmP↑↓ (m, t), equal to the off-diagonal element r↑↓ (t) of the marginal state r̂(t) of S. The bath gives\nrise on the right-hand side to a non-linear partial differential structure, which arises from the discrete nature of the\nspectrum of m̂.\n47 Numerically we find for N = 1000 extended distributions, see Figs. 7.5 and 7.6, since the typical peak width 1/\n48 This property does not hold for P\n\n↑↓ , since X↑↓ contains a term 2igt/~ arising from the left hand side of (4.29)\n\n√\nN is still sizable\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n57\n\nThe final equation of motion (4.30) for P↑↑ has the form of a Fokker–Planck equation [253, 254], which describes\na stochastic motion of the variable m. Its coefficient v, which depends on m and t, can be interpreted as a drift velocity,\nwhile its coefficient w characterizes a diffusion process. This analogy with a classical diffusion process, should not,\nhowever, hide the quantum origin of the diffusion term, which is as sizeable for large N as the drift term. While the\ndrift term comes out by bluntly taking the continuous limit of (4.16), the diffusion term originates, as shown by the\nabove derivation, from the conjugate effect of two features: (i) the smallness of the fluctuations of m, and (ii) the\ndiscreteness of the spectrum of the pointer observable m̂. Although the pointer is macroscopic, its quantum nature is\nessential, not only in the off-diagonal sector, but also in the diagonal sector which accounts for the registration of the\nresult.\n5.

From the viewpoint of the magnet\nM, we shall see in § 5.1.3 that the phase occurring in (5.2) generates time-dependent correlations between M and the\ntransverse components of s.\nThe expectation values h ŝa (t)i of the components of s are found from (3.30) by summing (5.1) and (5.2) over\nm. These equations are valid for arbitrary N and arbitrary time t as long as the bath is inactive. If N is sufficiently\nlarge and t sufficiently small so that the summand is a smooth function on the scale δm = 2/N, that is, if N \u001d 1 and\nt \u001c ~/g, we can use (4.20) to replace the summation over m by an integration. These conditions will be fulfilled in\nsubsections 5.1 and 5.2; we shall relax the second one in subsection 5.3 where we study the effects of the discreteness\nof m. Using the expression (3.49), (3.50) of PM (m, 0), we find by integrating (5.2) over m:\n2\n\nr↑↓ (t) = r↑↓ (0) e−(t/τtrunc ) ,\n\n(5.3)\n\nor equivalently\nh ŝa (t)i =\nh ŝz (t)i =\nwhere we introduced the truncation time\n49 The die is cast\n\n2\n\nh ŝa (0)i e−(t/τtrunc ) ,\nh ŝz (0)i ,\n\n(a = x,y),\n\n(5.4)\n(5.5)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n58\n\n~\n~\nτtrunc ≡ √\n= √\n.\n2N δ0 g\n2 Ng∆m\n\n(5.6)\n\nAlthough P↑↓ (m, t) is merely an oscillating function of t for each value of m, the summation over m has given rise to\nextinction. This property arises from the dephasing that exists between the oscillations for different values of m.\nIn the case T 0 = ∞ of a fully disordered initial state, we may solve directly (4.8) (without right-hand side) from the\ninitial condition (4.9). We obtain, for arbitrary N, R̂↑↓ (t) = r↑↓ (0)2−N exp(2iNgm̂t/~), whence by using the definition\n(3.2) of m̂ and taking the trace over M, we find the exact result50\n\nr↑↓ (t) = r↑↓ (0) cos\n\n2gt\n~\n\n!N\n,\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhich reduces to (5.3) for times of order τtrunc .\nThus, over a time scale of order τtrunc , the transverse components of the spin S decay and vanish while the z∗\ncomponent is unaltered: the off-diagonal elements r↑↓ = r↓↑\nof the marginal density matrix of S disappear during the\nvery first stage of the measurement process. It was to be expected that the apparatus, which is a large object, has a\nrapid and strong effect on the much smaller system S. In the present\n√ model, this rapidity arises from the large number\nN of spins of the magnet, which shows up through the factor 1/ N in the expression (5.6) of τtrunc .\n†\nAs we shall see in § 5.1.3, the off-diagonal block R̂↑↓ = R̂↓↑\nof the full density matrix D̂ of S + A is proportional\n2\nto r̂↑↓ (t) and its elements also decrease as exp[−(t/τtrunc ) ], at least those elements which determine correlations\ninvolving a number of spins of M small compared to N. In the vocabulary of § 1.3.2, truncation therefore takes place\nfor the overall system S + A over the brief initial time lapse τtrunc , while Eq. (5.3) describes weak truncation for S.\nThe quantum nature of the truncation process manifests itself through the occurrence of two different Hamiltonians\nĤ↑ and Ĥ↓ in the Hilbert space of M. Both of them occur in the dynamical equation (4.18) for P↑↓ , whereas only Ĥ↑\noccurs in (4.16) for P↑↑ through Ω±↑ , and likewise only Ĥ↓ for P↓↓ , through Ω±↓ .\nThe truncation time τtrunc is inversely proportional to the coupling g between ŝz and each spin σ̂(n)\nz of the magnet. It\ndoes not depend directly on the couplings Jq (q = 2, 4) between the spins σ̂(n)\nz . Indeed, the dynamical equations (4.16),\n(4.18) without bath-magnet coupling involve only H↑ (m) − H↓ (m), so that the interactions ĤM which are responsible\nfor ferromagnetism cancel out therein. These interactions occur only through the right-hand side which describes the\neffect of the bath. They also appear indirectly in τtrunc through the factor δ0 of ∆m given by (3.52), in the case q = 2\nof an Ising magnet M. When J2 , 0, the occurrence of δ0 > 1 thus contributes to accelerate the truncation process.\n5.1.2. Truncation versus decoherence: a general phenomenon\nIt is often said [32, 33, 40, 199, 200, 201, 202] that “von Neumann’s reduction is a decoherence effect”. (The traditional word “reduction” covers in the literature both concepts of “truncation” and “reduction” as defined in § 1.3.2.)\nAs is well known, decoherence is the rapid destruction of coherent superpositions of distinct pure states induced by\na random environment, such as a thermal bath. In the latter seminal case, the characteristic decoherence time has\nthe form of ~/T divided by some power of the number of degrees of freedom of the system and by a dimensionless\ncoupling constant between the system and the bath (see also our discussion of the decoherence approach in section 2).\nHere, things are different. As we have just seen and as will be studied below in detail, the initial truncation process\ninvolves only the magnet. Although the bath is part of the apparatus, it has no effect here and the characteristic truncation time τtrunc does not depend on the bath temperature. Indeed the dimensional factor of (5.6) is ~/g, and not ~/T .\nThe thermal fluctuations are replaced by the fluctuation ∆m of the pointer variable, which does not depend on T 0 for\nq = 4 and which decreases with T 0 as (3.52) for q = 2.\nThe fact that the truncation is controlled only by the coupling of the pointer variable m̂ with S is exhibited by\nthe occurrence, in (5.6), of its number N of degrees of freedom of M. Registration of sz requires this variable to be\n50 An equivalent way to derive this result is to employ (3.29) for making the identification Pdis (m, t) = G(m) × r (0)2−N exp(2iNgmt/~), and to\n↑↓\n↑↓\nsum over the values (3.23) of m\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n59\n\ncollective, so that N \u001d 1. However, long before registration begins to take place in A through the influence on D̂ of\nr↑↑ (0) and r↓↓ (0), the large size of the detector entails the loss of r↑↓ (0) and r↓↑ (0).\nMoreover, the basis in which the truncation takes place is selected by the very design of the apparatus. It depends\non the observable which is being measured. Had we proceeded to measure ŝ x instead of ŝz , we would have changed\nthe orientation of the magnetic dot; the part of the initial state r̂ (0) of S that gets lost would have been different, being\nrelated to the off-diagonal elements in the x-basis. Contrary to standard decoherence, truncation is here a controlled\neffect.\nAltogether, it is only the pointer degrees of freedom directly coupled to S that are responsible for the rapid truncation. As such, it is a dephasing. The effects of the bath are important (sections 6.2 and 7), but do not infer on the initial\ntruncation process, on the time scale τtrunc . We consider it therefore confusing to use the term “decoherence” for the\ndecay of the off-diagonal blocks in a quantum measurement, since its mechanism can be fundamentally different from\na standard environment-induced decoherence. Here the truncation is a consequence of dephasing between oscillatory\nterms which should be summed to generate the physical quantities51 .\nThe above considerations hold for the class of models of quantum measurements for which the pointer has many\ndegrees of freedom directly coupled to S [68, 182, 183] (see also [202] in this context). We have already found for\nthe truncation time a behavior analogous to (5.6) in a model where the detector is a Bose gas [181], with a scaling\nin N −1/4 instead of N −1/2 . More generally, suppose we wish to measure an arbitrary observable ŝ of a microscopic\nsystem S, with discrete eigenvalues si and corresponding projections Π̂i . The result should be registered by some\npointer variable m̂ of an apparatus A coupled to ŝ. The full Hamiltonian has still the form (3.3), and it is natural to\nassume that the system–apparatus coupling has the same form\nĤSA = −Ng ŝm̂,\n\n(general operators ŝ, m̂)\n\n(5.8)\n\nas (3.5). The coupling constant g refers to each one of the N elements of the collective pointer, so that a factor N\nappears in (5.8) as in (3.5), if m̂ is dimensionless and normalized in such a way that the range of its relevant eigenvalues\nis finite when N becomes large. The truncated density matrix r̂ (t) is made of blocks hiα| r̂ | jβi where α takes as many\nvalues as the dimension of Π̂i . It can be obtained as\nX\n(5.9)\nhiα| P (m, t) | jβi ,\nhiα| r̂ (t) | jβi =\nm\n\nwhere hiα| P (m, t) | jβi, which generalizes P↑↓ (m, t), is defined by\n\u0010\n\u0011\nhiα| P (m, t) | jβi = hiα| trA δm̂,m D̂ | jβi .\n\n(5.10)\n\nWe have denoted by m the eigenvalues of m̂, and by δm̂,m the projection operator on m in the Hilbert space of A. The\nquantity (5.10) satisfies an equation of motion dominated by (5.8):\n\"\n#\nd\ni~ + Ng(si − s j )m hiα| P (m, t) | jβi ' 0.\n(5.11)\ndt\nIn fact, the terms arising from ĤS (which need no longer vanish but only commute with ŝ) and from ĤA (which\ncommutes with the initial density operator R̂ (0)) are small during the initial instants compared to the term arising\nfrom the coupling ĤSA . We therefore find for short times\nhiα| r̂ (t) | jβi = hiα| r̂ (0) | jβi trA R̂ (0) eiNg(si −s j )m̂t/~ .\n\n(5.12)\n\nThe rapidly oscillating terms in the right-hand side interfere destructively as in (5.3) on a short time, if m̂ has a\ndense spectrum and an initial distribution involving many eigenvalues. Each contribution is merely oscillating, but the\nsummation over eigenvalues produces an extinction. (We come back to this point in subsection 5.2 and in § 12.2.3.)\nThis decrease takes place on a time scale of order ~/Ngδs∆m, where δs is the level spacing of the measured observable\nŝ and ∆m is the width of the distribution of eigenvalues of m̂ in the initial state of the apparatus. Leaving aside the\nlater stages of the measurement process, we thus acknowledge the generality of the present truncation mechanism,\nand that of the expression (5.6) for the truncation time in the spin 12 situation where δs = 2.\n51 In section 6.2 we shall discuss the effects of decoherence by the bath, which does take place, but long after the truncation time scale\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n60\n\n5.1.3. Establishment and disappearance of correlations\nThe most rigid structures, the most impervious to change,\nwill collapse first\nEckhart Tolle\nLet us now examine how the apparatus evolves during this first stage of the measurement process, described by\nEqs. (5.1) and (5.2). The first equation implies that the marginal density operator R̂M (t) = R̂↑↑ (t) + R̂↓↓ (t) of M\nremains unchanged. This property agrees with the idea that M, a large object, has a strong influence on S, a small\nobject, but that conversely a long time is required before M is affected by its interaction with S. Eqs. (5.1) also imply\nthat no correlation is created between ŝz and M.\nHowever, although R̂M (t) = R̂ (0), correlations are created between M and the transverse component ŝ x (or ŝy )\n\u0001\nof S. These correlations are described by the quantities C x = P↑↓ + P↓↑ and Cy = i P↑↓ − P↓↑ introduced in (3.30).\n(n)\nSince R̂↑↓ is a function of m̂ only, the components σ̂(n)\nx and σ̂y of the spins of M remain statistically independent,\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)2\nwith hσ̂ x i = hσ̂y i = 0 and with the quantum fluctuations hσ̂ x i = hσ̂(n)2\ny i = 1. The correlations between M and S\ninvolve only the z-component of the spins σ̂(n) of the magnet and the x- or y-component of the tested spin s.

The truncation, a cascade process\nHet viel in gruzelementen52\nDutch saying\nThe mechanism of truncation in the present model is therefore comparable to a current mechanism of irreversibility\nin statistical mechanics (§ 1.2.2). In a classical Boltzmann gas, initially off-equilibrium with a non-uniform density,\nthe relaxation toward uniform density takes place through the establishment of correlations between a larger and\nlarger number of particles, under the effect of successive collisions [54, 55, 56]. Here, similar features occur although\n∗\nquantum dynamics is essential. The relaxation (5.4) of the off-diagonal elements r↑↓ = r↓↑\nof the marginal state r̂ of S\nis accompanied by the generation, owing to the coupling ĤSA , of correlations between S and M.\nSuch correlations, absent at the initial time, are built up and fade out in a cascade, as shown by eq. (5.23) and\nFig. 5.1. Let us characterize the state R̂ of S + M by the expectation values and correlations of the operators ŝa\nand σ̂(n)\na . The order of S, initially embedded in the expectation values of the transverse components r↑↓ (0) of the\nspin ŝ, is progressively transferred to correlations (5.17) between these components and one spin of M, then in turn\nto correlations (5.22) with two spins, with three spins, and so on. The larger the rank k of the correlations, the\nsmaller they are, as ∆mk ∼ 1/N k/2 (Eq. (5.23)); but the larger their number is, as N!/k! (N − k)! ≈ N k /k!. Their\ntime-dependence, in tk exp [− (t/τtrunc )2 ], shows how they blow up and blow out successively.\nAs a specific feature of our model of quantum measurement, the interaction process does not affect the marginal\nstatistical state of M. All the multiple correlations produced by the coupling ĤSA lie astride S and M.\nTruncation, defined as the disappearance of the off-diagonal blocks R̂↑↓ = R̂↓↑ of the full density matrix D̂ of S+A,\nor equivalently of the expectation values of all operators involving ŝ x or ŝy , results from the proportionality of R̂↑↓ (t) to\nr↑↓ (t), within a polynomial coefficient in t associated with the factor tk in the k-th rank correlations. Initially, only few\namong the 2N ×2N elements of the matrix R̂↑↓ (0) do not vanish, those which correspond to 2r↑↓ (0) = h ŝ x (0)i−ih ŝy (0)i\nand to PM (m, 0) given by (3.49). The very many elements of R̂↑↓ (0) which describe correlations between ŝ x or\nŝy and the spins of M, absent at the initial time, grow, while an overall factor exp[−(t/τtrunc )2 ] damps R̂↑↓ (t). At\ntimes τtrunc \u001c t \u001c ~/g, all elements of R̂↑↓ (t) and hence of R̂↑↓ (t) have become negligibly small53 . In principle,\nno information is lost since the equations of motion are reversible; in particular, the commutation of Ĥ with the\nprojections Π̂↑ and Π̂↓ , together with the equation of motion (4.1), implies that i~d(R̂↑↓ R̂↓↑ )/dt = [Ĥ, R̂↑↓ R̂↓↑ ], and\n†\nhence that trA R̂↑↓ R̂↑↓\nis constant in time and remains equal to |r↑↓ (0)|2 trA [R̂(0)]2 . However, the initial datum r↑↓ (0)\ngets spread among very many matrix elements of R̂↑↓ which nearly vanish, exactly as in the irreversibility paradox\n(§ 1.2.2).\nIf N could be made infinite, the progressive creation of correlations would provide a rigorous mathematical characterization of the irreversibility of the truncation process, as for relaxation processes in statistical mechanics. Consider,\nfor some fixed value of K, the set of correlations (5.23) of ranks k such that 0 ≤ k ≤ K, including h ŝ x i and h ŝy i for\nk = 0. All correlations of this set vanish in the limit N → ∞ for fixed t, since τtrunc then tends to 0. (The coupling\nconstant g may depend on N, in which case it should satisfy Ng2 → ∞.) This property holds even for infinite K,\nprovided K → ∞ after N → ∞, a limit which characterizes the irreversibility. However, such a limit is not uniform: the reversibility of the underlying dynamics manifests itself through the finiteness of high-order correlations for\nsufficiently large t (§ 5.3.2).\nAnyhow N is not allowed in physics to go to infinity, since the time τtrunc would unrealistically vanish. For large\nbut finite N, there is no rigorous qualitative characterization of irreversibility, neither in this model of measurement\nnor in statistical mechanics, but the above discussion remains relevant. In fact, physically, it is legitimate to regard\nas equal to zero a quantity which is less than some small bound, and to regard as unobservable and irrelevant all\ncorrelations which involve a number k of spins exceeding some bound K much smaller than N. We shall return to this\nissue in § 12.2.3.\n\n52 It fell and broke into tiny pieces\n53 The latter implication follows because the bath contributions cannot raise the S + A correlations\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n63\n\n5.2. Randomness of the initial state of the magnet\nSuccess isn’t how far you got,\nbut the distance you traveled from where you started\nGreek proverb\nInitial states R̂ (0) that can actually be prepared at least in a thought experiment, such as the paramagnetic canonical\nequilibrium distribution of § 3.3.3, involve large randomness. In particular, if the initialization temperature T 0 is\nQ\nsufficiently large, the state (3.47), i. e., R̂M (0) = 2−N n σ̂(n)\n0 , is the most disordered statistical state of M; in such a\ncase, PM (m, 0) is given by (3.51). We explore in this subsection how the truncation process is modified for other, less\nrandom, initial states of M.\n5.2.1. Arbitrary initial states\nThe derivations of the equations of motion in subsections 4.1 and 4.2 were general, irrespective of the initial state.\nHowever, in subsections 4.3 and 5.1 we have relied on the fact that R̂M (0) depends only on m̂. In order to deal with an\narbitrary initial state R̂M (0), we return to eq. (4.8), where we can as above neglect for very short times the coupling\nwith the bath. The operators R̂i j (t) and Ĥi in the Hilbert space of M no longer commute because R̂i j now involves\nspin operators other than m̂. However, the probabilities and correlations Pi j (m, t) defined by (3.25) still satisfy Eqs.\n(B.13) of Appendix B without right-hand side. Hence the expressions (5.1) and (5.2) for Pi j (m) at short times hold\nfor any initial state R̂M (0), with PM (m, 0) given by trM R̂M (0) δm̂,m .\nThe various expressions (5.4), (5.5), (5.6), (5.17), (5.21), (5.23) relied only on the Gaussian shape of the probability distribution PM (0, m) associated with the initial state. They will therefore remain valid for any initial state R̂M (0)\nthat provides a narrow distribution PM (m, 0), centered at m = 0 and having a width ∆m small (∆m \u001c 1) though large\ncompared to the level spacing, viz. ∆m \u001d 2/N. Indeed, within corrections of relative order 1/N, such distributions\nare equivalent to a Gaussian. The second condition (∆m \u001d 2/N) ensures that τtrunc is much shorter than ~/g, another\ncharacteristic time that we shall√introduce in § 5.3.1.\nIn fact, the behavior in 1/ N for ∆m is generic, so that the truncation time has in general the same expression\n(5.6) as for a paramagnetic canonical equilibrium state, with δ0 defined by δ20 = NtrM R̂M (0) m̂2 . The dynamics of\nthe truncation process described above holds for most possible initial states of the apparatus: decay of h ŝ x (t)i and\nh ŝy (t)i; generation of a cascade of correlations h ŝa m̂k (t)i of order ∆mk between the transverse components of the spin\nS and the pointer variable m̂; increase, then decay of the very many matrix elements of R̂↑↓ (t), which are small as\n\u0011k\n\u0010√\n2 ∆m t/τtrunc exp[− (t/τtrunc )2 ] for t \u001c ~/g.\nIn case the initial density operator R̂M (0) is a symmetric function of the N spins, the correlations between ŝ x or ŝy\nand the z-components of the individual spins of M are still given by expressions such as (5.22). However, in general,\n(n)\nR̂M (0) no longer depends on the operator m̂ only; it involves transverse components σ̂(n)\nx or σ̂y , and so does R̂↑↓ (t),\nwhich now includes correlations of ŝ x or ŝy with x- or y-components of the spins σ̂(n) . The knowledge of P↑↓ (m, t) is\nin this case not sufficient to fully determine R̂↑↓ (t), since √\n(3.25) holds but not (3.27).\nThe proportionality of the truncation time τtrunc = ~/ 2 Ng∆m to the inverse of the fluctuation ∆m shows that the\ntruncation is a disorder effect, since ∆m measures the randomness of the pointer variable in the initial state. This is\neasy to understand: S sees an effective magnetic field Ngm which is random through m, and it is this very randomness\n√\nwhich causes the relaxation. The existence of such a randomness in the initial state, even though it is small as 1/ N,\nis necessary to ensure the transfer of the initial order embodied in r↑↓ (0) into the cascade of correlations between S\nand M and to entail a brief truncation time τtrunc . Boltzmann’s elucidation of the irreversibility paradox also relied on\nstatistical considerations about the initial state of a classical gas which will relax to equilibrium.\n5.2.2. Pure versus mixed initial state\nIt is therefore natural to wonder whether the truncation of the state would still take place for pure initial states of\nM, which are the least random ones in quantum physics, in contrast to the paramagnetic state (3.47) or (3.51) which\nis the most random one. To answer this question, we first consider the pure state with density operator\nR̂M (0) =\n\nN\nY\n1\u0010\nn=1\n\n2\n\n\u0011\n1 + σ̂(n)\nx ,\n\n(5.25)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n64\n\nin which all spins σ̂(n) point in the x-direction. This initialization may be achieved by submitting M to a strong field in\nthe x-direction and letting it thermalize with a cold\n√ bath B for a long duration before the beginning of the measurement.\nThe fluctuation of m̂ in the state (5.25) is 1/ N. Hence, for this pure initial state of M, the truncation takes place\nexactly as for the fully disordered initial paramagnetic state, since both yield the same probability distribution (3.51)\nfor m.\nA similar conclusion holds for the most general factorized pure state, with density operator\nR̂M (0) =\n\nN\nY\n1\u0010\nn=1\n\n2\n\n\u0011\n1 + u(n) · σ̂(n) ,\n\n(5.26)\n\nwhere the u(n) are arbitrary unit vectors pointing in different directions54 . The fluctuation ∆m, then given by\nδ20 = N∆m2 =\n\nN\n\u0010 \u00112 \u0015\n1 X\u0014\n1 − u(n)\n,\nz\nN n=1\n\n(5.27)\n\nis in general sufficiently large to ensure again the properties of subsection 5.1, which depend on R̂M (0) only through\n∆m.\nIncoherent or coherent superpositions of such pure states will yield the same effects. We will return to this point\nin § 12.1.4, noting conversely that an irreversibility which occurs for a mixed state is also statistically present in most\nof the pure states that underlie it.\nQuantum mechanics brings in another feature: a given mixed state can be regarded as a superposition of pure states\nQ\nin many different ways. For instance, the completely disordered paramagnetic state (3.47), R̂M (0) = 2−N n σ̂(n)\n0 , can\nbe described by saying that each spin points at random in the +z or in the −z-direction; it can also be described as\nan incoherent superposition of the pure states (5.26) with randomly oriented vectors u(n) . This ambiguity makes the\nanalysis into pure components of a quantum mixed state unphysical (§ 10.2.3).\nLet us stress that the statistical or quantum nature of the fluctuations ∆m of the pointer variable\n√ in the initial state\nis irrelevant as regards the truncation process. In the most random state (3.47) this fluctuation 1/ N appears as purely\nstatistical; it would be just the same for “classical spins” √\nhaving only a z-component with random values ±1. In the\npure state (5.25), it is merely quantal; indeed, its value 1/ N is the lower bound provided by Heisenberg’s inequality\niE 2\n1\n1 Dh\nm̂y , m̂z\n= 2 hm̂ x i2\n(5.28)\n4\nN\n√\nP\nfor the operators m̂a = N −1 n σ̂(n)\na (a = x, y, z), with here ∆my = ∆mz = 1/ N, hm̂ x i = 1. Differences between these\ntwo situations arise only at later times, through the coupling ĤMB with the bath.\n∆m2y ∆m2z ≥\n\n5.2.3. Squeezed initial states\nHe who is desperate will squeeze oil\nout of a grain of sand\nJapanese proverb\n√There exist states R̂M (0), which we will term as “squeezed”, for which the fluctuation ∆m is of smaller order than\n1/ N. An extreme case in which ∆m = 0 is, for even N, a pure state in which N/2 spins point in the +z-direction,\nN/2 in the −z-direction; then PM (m, 0) = δm,0 . Coherent or incoherent superpositions of such states yield the same\ndistribution PM (m, 0) = δm,0 , in particular the microcanonical paramagnetic state R̂M (0) = δm̂,0 [(N/2)!]2 /N!. In all\nsuch cases, m and ∆m exactly vanish so that the Hamiltonian and the initial state of S + M satisfy (ĤSA + ĤM )D̂(0) = 0,\nD̂(0)(ĤSA + ĤM ) = 0. According to Eq. (4.8), nothing will happen, both in the diagonal and off-diagonal sectors, until\nthe bath begins to act through the weak terms of the right-hand side. The above mechanism of truncation based on\nthe coupling between S and M thus fails for the states D̂(0) such that PM (m, 0) = δm,0 , whether these states are pure\nor not.\n54 The consideration of such a state is academic since it would be impossible, even in a thought experiment, to set M in it\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n65\n\nThe situation is similar for slightly less squeezed states in which the fluctuation ∆m is of the order of the level\nspacing δm = 2/N, with about half of the spins nearly oriented in the +z-direction and half in the −z-direction. When\nthe bath B is disregarded, the off-diagonal block R̂↑↓ (t) then evolves,\nas shown by (5.2), on a time scale of order ~/2g\n√\ninstead of the much smaller truncation time (5.6), of order 1/ N.\nIn such cases the truncation will appear (contrary to our discussion of § 5.1.2) as a phenomenon of the decoherence\ntype, governed indirectly by B through ĤSA and ĤMB , and taking place on a time scale much longer than τtrunc . This\ncircumstance occurs in many models of measurement, see section 2, in particular those for which S is not coupled\nwith many degrees of freedom of the pointer. It is clearly the large size of M which is responsible here for the fast\ntruncation. We return to this point in § 8.1.4.\nHere again, we recover ideas that were introduced to elucidate the irreversibility paradox. In a Boltzmann gas, one\ncan theoretically imagine initial states with a uniform density which would give rise after some time to a macroscopic\ninhomogeneity [55, 56]. But such states are extremely scarce and involve subtle specific correlations. Producing one\nof them would involve the impossible task of handling the particles one by one. However, for the present truncation\nmechanism, the initial states of M such that the off-diagonal blocks of the density matrix fail to decay irreversibly\nare much less exceptional. While the simplest types of preparation of the apparatus, such as setting M in√a canonical\nparamagnetic state through interaction with a warm bath (§ 3.3.3), yield a fluctuation ∆m of order 1/ N, we can\nimagine producing squeezed states even through macroscopic means. For instance, a microcanonical paramagnetic\ntype of initial state of M could be obtained by separating the sample of N spins into two equal pieces, by setting\nthem (using a cold bath and opposite magnetic fields) into ferromagnetic states with opposite magnetizations, and by\nmixing them again. Some spin-conserving interaction can then randomize the orientations before the initial time of\nthe measurement process. We can also imagine, as in modern experiments on optical lattices, switching on and off a\nstrong antiferromagnetic interaction to equalize the numbers of spins pointing up and down.\n5.3. Consequences of discreteness\nHij keek of hij water zag branden55\nDutch proverb\nSomewhat surprisingly since N is large, it appears that the discreteness of the pointer variable m has specific\nimplications in the decay of the off-diagonal blocks of the density matrix. We shall later see that such effects do not\noccur in the diagonal sectors related to registration.\n5.3.1. The recurrence time\nIt’s no use going back to yesterday,\nbecause I was a different person then\nLewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland\nAlthough we have displayed the truncation of the state as an irreversible process on the time scale τtrunc , the\ndynamics of our model without the bath is so simple that we expect the reversibility of the equations of motion to\nmanifest itself for finite N. As a matter of fact, the irreversibility arises as usual (§ 1.2.2) from an approximate\ntreatment, justified only under the conditions considered above: large N, short time, correlations of finite order. This\napproximation, which underlined the results (5.4) and (5.16) of subsections 5.1and 5.2, consisted in treating m as a\ncontinuous variable. We now go beyond it by returning to the expression (5.13), which is exact if the bath is inactive\n(γ = 0), and by taking into account the discreteness of the spectrum of m̂.\nFor N \u001d 1, we can still use for PM (m, 0) the Gaussian form (3.49) based on (3.24). The generating function\n(5.13) then reads\nr\n\"\n#\n2 1 X\nm2\nt\nΨ↑↓ (λ, t) = r↑↓ (0)\nexp −\n+\niπNm\n+\niλm\n,\n(5.29)\nπ N∆m m\nτrecur\n2∆m2\n55 He looked as if he saw water burn, i.e., he was very surprised\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n66\n\nwhere we have introduced the recurrence time\nτrecur ≡\n\n√ ∆m\nπ~\n=π 2\nτtrunc .\n2g\nδm\n\n(5.30)\n\nThe values (3.23) of m that contribute to the sum (5.28) are equally spaced, at distances δm = 2/N. The replacement\nof this sum by an integral, which was performed in § 5.1.3, is legitimate only if t \u001c τrecur and |λ| \u001c N. When the time\nt increases and begins to approach τrecur within a delay of order τtrunc , the correlations undergo an inverse cascade:\nSimpler and simpler correlations are gradually generated from correlations involving a huge number of spins of M.\nThis process is the time-reversed of the one described in § 5.1.3. When t reaches τrecur , or a multiple of it, the various\nterms of (5.29) add up, instead of interfering destructively as when t is of order of τtrunc . In fact, the generating\nfunction (5.29) satisfies\nΨ↑↓ (λ, t + τrecur ) = (−1)N Ψ↑↓ (λ, t) ,\n(5.31)\nso that without the bath the state D̂ (t) of S + M evolves periodically, returning to its initial expression r̂ (0) ⊗ R̂ (0) at\nequally spaced times: the Schrödinger cat terms revive.\nThis recurrence is a quantum phenomenon [55, 56]. It arises from the discreteness and regularity of the spectrum\nof the pointer variable operator m̂, and from the oversimplified nature of the model solved in the present section, which\nincludes only the part (3.5) of the Hamiltonian. We will exhibit in section 6 two mechanisms which, in less crude\nmodels, modify the dynamics on time scales larger than τtrunc and prevent recurrences from occurring.\n√\nThe recurrence time (5.30) is much longer than the truncation time, since ∆m/δm = 12 δ0 N. Thus, long after\nthe initial order carried by the transverse components h ŝ x i and h ŝy i of the spin S has dissolved into numerous and\nweak correlations, this order revives through an inverse cascade. At the time τrecur , S gets decorrelated from M, with\nr↑↓ (τrecur ) = (−1)N r↑↓ (0). The memory of the off-diagonal elements, which was hidden in correlations, was only\ndephased, it was not lost for good, and it emerges back. Such a behavior of the transverse components of the spin S\nis reminiscent of the behavior of the transverse magnetization in spin echo experiments [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65]. By\nitself it is a dephasing which can cohere again, and will do so unless other mechanisms (see section 6) prevent this.\n5.3.2. High-order correlations\nVingt fois sur le métier remettez votre ouvrage56\nNicolas Boileau, L’Art poétique\nWe can write Ψ↑↓ (λ, t) given by (5.29) more explicitly, for large N, by formally extending the summation over m\nbeyond −1 and +1, which is innocuous, and by using Poisson’s summation formula, which reads\nZ\n+∞\nX\nN X\n(−1) pN\ndm e−iπNmp f (m) .\n(5.32)\nf (m) =\n2\nm\np=−∞\nAs a result, we get\nΨ↑↓ (λ, t) = r↑↓ (0)\n\n+∞\nX\np=−∞\n\n(−1)\n\npN\n\niλ∆m\nt − pτrecur\nexp √ + i\nτtrunc\n2\n\n!2\n,\n\n(5.33)\n\nwhich is nothing but a sum of contributions deduced from (5.15), (5.16) and (5.3) by repeated shifts of t (with alternating signs for odd N).

In fact, the values\n√ of interest\nfor t are of order τtrunc , or of τtrunc k for large k, since the correlations reach their maximum at t = τtrunc k/2.

Irreversibility of the truncation\nQuare fremuerunt gentes,\net populi meditati sunt inania?57\nPsalm 2\nThe sole consideration of the interaction between the tested spin S and the pointer M has been sufficient to explain\nand analyze the truncation of the state, which takes place on the time scale τtrunc , at the very early stage of the\nmeasurement process. However this Hamiltonian (Eq. (3.5)) is so simple that if it were alone it would give rise to\nrecurrences around the times τrecur , 2τrecur , ... . In fact the evolution is modified by other processes, which as we shall\nsee hinder the possibility of recurrence and render the truncation irreversible on any reachable time scale.\n57 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n68\n\n6.1. Destructive interferences\nBis repetita (non) placent58\ndiverted from Horace\nWe still neglect in this subsection the effects of the phonon bath (keeping γ = 0), but will show that the recurrent\nbehavior exhibited in § 5.3.1 is suppressed by a small change in the model, which makes it a little less idealized.\n6.1.1. Spread of the coupling constants\nWhen we introduced the interaction (3.5) between S and A, we assumed that the coupling constants between the\ntested spin ŝ and each of the spins σ̂(n) of the apparatus were all the same. However, even though the range of the\nforces is long compared to the size of the magnetic dot, these forces can be different, at least slightly. This is similar\nto the inhomogeneous broadening effect well known in NMR physics [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65]. We thus replace here\nĤSA by the more general interaction\nN\nX\n0\n(g + δgn ) σ̂(n)\nĤSA\n= − ŝz\n(6.1)\nz ,\nn=1\n\nwhere the couplings g + δgn are constant in time and have the small dispersion\nN\nX\n\nN\n\nδg2 =\n\n1 X 2\nδg ,\nN n=1 n\n\nδgn = 0.\n\n(6.2)\n\nn=1\n\nThe equations of motion (4.8) for D̂, the right-hand side of which we disregard, remain valid, with the effective\nHamiltonian\nX\nX N Jq\n(g + δgn ) σ̂(n)\nĤi = −si\nm̂q\n(6.3)\nz −\nq\nn\nq\ninstead of (4.6). This Hamiltonian, as well as the initial conditions R̂i j (0) = ri j (0) R̂M (0), depends only on the commuting observables σ̂(n)\nz . Hence the latter property is also satisfied by the operators R̂i j (t) at all times. Accordingly,\nR̂↑↑ (t) and R̂↓↓ (t) remain constant, and the part ĤM of Ĥi does not contribute to the equation for R̂↑↓ (t), which is\nreadily solved as\n\n\nN\nX\n\n2i\n(n)\nδgn σ̂z t    ,\n(6.4)\nR̂↑↓ (t) = r↑↓ (0) R̂M (0) exp   Ngm̂t +\n~\nn=1\nwith R̂M (0) given in terms of m̂ by (3.46).

However, it is expected to remain\nextremely small at later times since the factors of (6.6) interfere destructively unless t is close to a multiple of\nπ~/2 (g + δgn ) for most n. In particular, the successive recurrences which occurred in § 4.4.1 at the times τrecur ,\n2τrecur , ... for δg = 0 and γ = 0 are now absent provided the deviations δgn are sufficiently large. We thus obtain a\npermanent truncation if we have at the time t = τrecur\n58 Repetitions are (not) appreciated\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n1\n\nN\nY\nn=1\n\ncos\n\nN\nπδgn Y −π2 δg2n /2g2\n2P\n2\n2\n2 2\n2\n≈\ne\n= e−π n δgn /2g = e−Nπ δg /2g ,\ng\nn=1\n\n69\n\n(6.7)\n\nthat is,\n1\nδg\n\ng\nπ\n\nr\n\n2\n.\nN\n\n(6.8)\n\nProvided this condition is satisfied, all results of subsections 5.1 and 5.2 hold, even for large times.

As in usual irreversible processes of statistical mechanics, it is mathematically not\nexcluded that (6.6) takes significant values around some values of t, if N is not too large and if many deviations δgn\nare arithmetically related to one another; but this can occur only for extremely large times, physically out of reach, as\nshown in § 6.1.2.\nThese conclusions hold for an arbitrary initial state (3.46).

If τirrev is such that τtrunc \u001c τirrev \u001c τrecur , that\nis, when (6.8) is satisfied, the off-diagonal blocks R̂↑↓ (t) of D̂(t) remain negligible on time scales of order τrecur .

Generality of the direct damping mechanism\n59\n\nԱնձրեւոտ օրը շատերը կասեն. \"Ջուր տար, քո հավերին լողացրու\":\nArmenian proverb\n\nWe have just seen that a modification of the direct coupling between the tested spin S and the magnet M, without\nany intervention of the bath, is sufficient to prevent the existence of recurrences after the initial damping of the offdiagonal blocks of D̂. In fact, recurrences took place in § 5.3.1 only because our original model was peculiar, involving\na complete symmetry between the N spins which constitute the pointer. We will now show that the mechanism\n59 On a rainy day, many people will say: Ask for my water to bathe your chickens\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n70\n\nof irreversibility of § 6.1.1, based merely on the direct coupling between the tested system and the pointer of the\napparatus, is quite general: it occurs as soon as the pointer presents no regularity.\nLet us therefore return to the wide class of models introduced in § 5.1.2, characterized by a coupling\nĤSA = −Ng ŝm̂,\n\n(general operators ŝ, m̂)\n\n(6.12)\n\nbetween the measured observable ŝ of the system S and the pointer observable m̂ of the apparatus A. We assume that\nthe pointer, which has N degrees of freedom, has no symmetry feature, so that the spectrum of m̂ displays neither\nsystematic degeneracies nor arithmetic properties. We disregard the other degrees of freedom of A, in particular the\nindirect coupling with the bath. The model considered above in § 6.1.1 enters this general frame, since its Hamiltonian\n(6.1) takes the form (6.12) if we identify our ŝz with the general ŝ and if we redefine m̂ as\n!\nN\nδgn (n)\n1 X\n1+\nσ̂z .\nm̂ =\nN n=1\ng\n\n(6.13)\n\nIndeed, provided the condition (6.8) is satisfied, the 2N eigenvalues of (6.13) are randomly distributed over the interval\n(−1, 1) instead of occurring at the values (3.23) with the huge multiplicities (3.24).\nIn all such models governed by the Hamiltonian (6.12), the off-diagonal elements of r̂ behave as (5.12) so that\ntheir time-dependence, and more generally that of the off-diagonal blocks of R̂, has the form\nQ\n\n1 X iωq t\nF (t) =\ne .\nQ q=1\n\n(6.14)\n\nIndeed, the matrix element (5.11) is a sum of exponentials involving the eigenfrequencies\n\nωq ≡\n\nNg(si − s j )mq\n,\n~\n\n(6.15)\n\nwhere mq are the eigenvalues of m̂. The number Q of these eigenfrequencies is large as an exponential of the number\nN of microscopic degrees of freedom of the pointer, for instance Q = 2N for (6.13). To study a generic situation,\nwe can regard the eigenvalues mq or the set ωq as independent random variables. Their distribution is governed by\nthe density of eigenvalues of m̂ and by the initial density operator R̂ (0) of the apparatus which enters (5.12) and\nwhich describes a metastable equilibrium. For sufficiently large N, we can take for each dimensionless mq a narrow\n√\nsymmetric gaussian distribution, with width of relative order 1/ N. The statistics of F (t) that we will study then\nfollows from the probability distribution for the frequencies ωq ,\n\n\n\u0010 \u0011\nω2q\n1\n,\n\np ωq = √\nexp   −\n(6.16)\n2∆ω2\n2π∆ω\n√\nwhere ∆ω is of order N due to the factor N entering the definition (6.15) of ωq . This problem has been tackled long\nago by Kac [256].\nWe first note that the expectation value of F (t) for this random distribution of frequencies,\nF (t) = e−∆ω t /2 ,\n2 2\n\n(6.17)\n\n√\ndecays exactly, for all times, as the Gaussian (5.3) with a truncation time τtrunc = 2/∆ω, encompassing the expression (5.6) that we found for short times in our original model.

Given some positive number f\n(less than 1), say f = 0.2, we define the recurrence time τrecur as the typical delay we have to wait on average before\n<F (t) rises back up to f . We evaluate this time in Appendix C. For f sufficiently small so that ln[I0 (2 f )] ' f 2 , a\nproperty which holds for f = 0.2, we find\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n√\n2π\nexp Q f 2 = π 2τtrunc exp Q f 2 .\n(6.20)\n∆ω\nAs Q behaves as an exponential of N, this generic recurrence time is inaccessibly large. Even for a pointer\ninvolving only N = 10 spins, in which case Q = 2N = 210 , and for f = 0.2, we have τrecur /τtrunc = 2.7 · 1018 . The\ndestructive interferences taking place between the various terms of (5.12) explain not only the truncation of the state\n(§ 5.1.2) but also, owing to the randomness of the coupling, the irretrievable nature of this decay process over any\nreasonable time lapse, in spite of the unitarity of the evolution.\nAlthough we expect the eigenfrequencies ωq associated with a large pointer to be distributed irregularly, the\ndistribution (6.16) chosen above, for which they are completely random and uncorrelated, is not generic. Indeed,\naccording to (6.15), these eigenfrequencies are quantum objects, directly related to the eigenvalues mq of the operator\nm̂. A more realistic model should therefore rely on the idea that m̂ is a complicated operator, which is reasonably\nrepresented by a random matrix. As well known, the eigenvalues of a random matrix are correlated: they repell\naccording to Wigner’s law. The above study should therefore be extended to random matrices m̂ instead of random\nuncorrelated frequencies ωq , using the techniques of the random matrix theory [257]. We expect the recurrence time\nthus obtained to be shorter than above, due to the correlations among the set ωq , but still to remain considerably longer\nthan with the regular spectrum of § 5.3.1.\nτrecur =\n\n6.2. Effect of the bath on the initial truncation\nYou can’t fight City Hall\nAmerican saying\nReturning to our original model of subsection 3.2 with a uniform coupling g between S and the spins of M, we\nnow take into account the effect, on the off-diagonal blocks of D, of the coupling γ between M and B. We thus start\nfrom eq. (4.29), to be solved for times of the order of the recurrence time. We will show that the damping due to the\nbath can prevent P↑↓ and hence R̂↑↓ from becoming significant at all times t larger than τtrunc , in spite of the regularity\nof the spectrum of m̂ which leads to the anomalously short recurrence time π~/2g of (5.30)60 .\nReaders interested mainly in the physics of the truncation may jump to § 9.6.1, where the mathematics is simplified\nusing insights gained about the behavior of the equation of motion for t \u001d ~/T through the rigorous approach of\n§ 6.2.1 and of appendix D.\n6.2.1. Determination of P↑↓ (t)\nWe have found recurrences in P↑↓ (m, t) by solving (4.18) without right-hand side and by taking into account the\ndiscreteness of m (§ 5.3.1). The terms arising from the bath will modify for each m the modulus and the phase of\nPdis\n↑↓ (m, t) = (2/N)P↑↓ (m, t).\nIn order to study these changes, we rely on the equation of motion (4.18), the right-hand side of which has been\nobtained in the large N limit while keeping however the values of m discrete as in § 5.3.1. Note first that the functions\nK̃t> (ω) and K̃t< (ω) defined by Eqs. (4.10) and (4.11), respectively, are complex conjugate for the same value of ω. It\nthen results from Eq. (4.18) together with its initial condition that 61\nP↑↓ (−m, t) = P∗↑↓ (m, t) = P↓↑ (m, t).\n60 For the related, effective decay of R (t) and R (t), see § 12.2.3\n↑↓\n↓↑\n61 Changing g into −g would also change P (m, t) into P∗ (m, t), but we shall stick to the ferromagnetic interaction g > 0\n↑↓\n↑↓\n\n(6.21)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n72\n\nBΓ\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\ntΤ recur\n\nFigure 6.1: The damping function B(t) issued from the interaction of the magnet with the bath. This function is measured in units of the dimensionless magnet-bath coupling\n√ constant γ, and the time is measured in units of the recurrence time τrecur = π~/2g. The parameters are T = 0.2J\nand g = 0.045J and ~Γ = 50 π/2 J. After an initial t4 growth, the curve is quasi linear with periodic oscillations. “Anti-damping” with dB/dt < 0\noccurs during the delay ατrecur before each recurrence (Eq.(6.33)). The condition NB(τrecur ) \u001d 1 entails the irreversible suppression of all the\nrecurrences.

Its complete expression is exhibited in Appendix\nD in terms of the autocorrelation function K(t) of the bath (Eq.

They are real on account of (6.21). The overall factor exp[−NB(t)] governs the amplitude of\nPdis\n↑↓ . The term Θ(t) modifies the oscillations which arose from the coupling between S and M. The term D(t) modifies\nthe width of the peak of Pdis\n↑↓ . The explicit expressions of these functions, given by (D.15) for B(t), (D.26) for Θ(t) and\n(D.29) for D(t), are derived in appendix D from the equation of motion (D.3) for A(m, t), which itself results directly\nfrom Eq. (4.29) for Pdis\n↑↓ . We analyze them below.\n6.2.2. The damping function\nThe main effect of the bath is the introduction in (6.23) of the overall factor exp[−NB(t)], which produces a\ndamping of the off-diagonal blocks R̂↑↓ and R̂↓↑ of the density matrix D̂ of S + M. The expression for B(t) derives\nfrom Eq. (D.8) and is given explicitly by\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\nB(t) = γ\n\nZ ∞\n0\n\n)\n\u0012 ω \u0013 ( sin2 Ωt\ndω ω\nΩ2 (1 − cos ωt cos Ωt) − ωΩ sin ωt sin Ωt\n~ω\n+\n,\ncoth\nexp −\nπ\n2T\nΓ 2(ω2 − Ω2 )\n(ω2 − Ω2 )2\n\n73\n\n(6.25)\n\nwith Ω = 2g/~. The ω-integral can be carried out analytically if one replaces in the spectrum of phonon modes (3.38)\nthe Debye cutoff by a quasi Lorentzian one, see Eq. (D.10) and the connection (D.11) between the cutoff parameters;\nthe result for B is given in (D.15). The function B(t) of Eq. (D.15), or, nearly equivalently, Eq. (6.25), is illustrated\nby fig. 6.1. We discuss here its main features in the limiting cases of interest.\nConsider first the short times t \u001c 1/Γ. This range covers the delay τtrunc during which the truncation takes place,\nbut it is much shorter than the recurrence time. We show in Appendix D that B(t) behaves for t \u001c 1/Γ as\n\nB(t) ∼\n\nγΓ2 g2 4\nt ,\n2π~2\n\n(6.26)\n\nincreasing slowly as shown by fig. 6.1. If NB(t) remains sufficiently small during the whole truncation process so that\nexp[−NB(t)] remains close to 1, the bath is ineffective over the delay τtrunc . This takes place under the condition\nNB(τtrunc ) = N\n\nγΓ2 g2 4\nγ~2 Γ2\nτ\n=\n1,\ntrunc\n2π~2\n8πNδ40 g2\n\n(6.27)\n\nwhich is easily satisfied in spite of the large value of ~Γ/g, since γ \u001c 1 and N \u001d 1. Then the coupling with the\nbath does not interfere with the truncation by the magnet studied in section 5. Otherwise, if NB(τtrunc ) is finite, the\ndamping by B, which behaves as an exponential of −t4 , enhances the truncation effect in exp[−(t/τtrunc )2 ] of M, and\nreduces the tails of the curves of fig. 5.1.\nConsider now the times t larger than ~/2πT , which is the memory time of the kernel K(t). We are then in\nthe Markovian regime. This range of times encompasses the recurrences which in the absence of the bath occur\nperiodically at the times t = pτrecur , with τrecur = π~/2g. Under the condition t \u001d ~/2πT , we show in Appendix D\nEq. (D.18)), that B(t) has the form\nB(t) =\n\n!\n!\nγπ\ng\nt\n2πt\nγ\n~Γ\n2πt\n1\ncoth\n−\nsin\n+\nln\n1 − cos\n.\n4\nT τrecur 2π\nτrecur\n4π 2πT\nτrecur\n\n(6.28)\n\nOn average, B(t) thus increases linearly along with the first term of (6.28), as exhibited by fig. 6.1. Hence, the bath\ngenerates in this region t \u001d ~/2πT the exponential damping\n\n\nt\nexp[−NB(t)] ∼ exp    − B     ,\nτirrev\n\n(6.29)\n\nwhere the decay is characterized by the bath-induced irreversibility time\nτBirrev =\n\n2~ tanh g/T\n.\nNγg\n\n(6.30)\n\nThe recurrences, at t = pτrecur , are therefore attenuated by the factor\n\n\n!\npτrecur\npπNγ\nexp   − B    = exp −\n.\n4 tanh g/T\nτirrev\n\n(6.31)\n\nThus, all recurrences are irreversibly suppressed, so that the initial truncation becomes definitive, provided the coupling between M and B is sufficiently strong so as to satisfy NB(τrecur ) \u001d 1, or equivalently τBirrev \u001c τrecur , that\nis:\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\nγ\n\n74\n\n4 tanh g/T\n.\nπN\n\n(6.32)\n\n2~\nNγT\n\n(6.33)\n\nIn case T \u001d g, the irreversibility time\nτBirrev ∼\n\ndepends only on the temperature of the bath, on the number of spins of the magnet, and on the magnet-bath coupling,\nirrespective of the system-magnet coupling.\nIn spite of the smallness of γ, the large value of N makes the condition (6.32) easy to satisfy. In fact, if the hardly\nmore stringent condition NB(~/2πT ) \u001d 1, that is, Nγ \u001d 4π, is satisfied, we have NB(t) \u001d 1 in the region t \u001d ~/2πT\nwhere the approximation (6.28) holds. Thus, although B(t) is quasi linear in this region, the exponential shape of the\ndecay (6.29), with its characteristic time τBirrev , loses physical relevance since exp[−NB(t)] is there practically zero.\nIn this same region t \u001d ~/2πT , the expression (6.28) of B(t) involves oscillatory contributions superimposed to\nthe linear increase considered above (fig. 6.1). In fact, the time derivative\n!\nπ\ng\nπt\nπt\nπt\n~Γ\nτrecur dB\n=\ncoth sin\ncos\nsin\n+ ln\n.\nγ dt\n2\nT\nτrecur\n2πT\nτrecur\nτrecur\n\n(6.34)\n\nof B(t) is periodic, with period τrecur , and it vanishes at the times t such that\n\nsin\n\nπt\n=0\nτrecur\n\nor\n\ntan\n\nπt\n2\n~Γ\ng\n= − ln\ntanh .\nτrecur\nπ 2πT\nT\n\n(6.35)\n\nThe first set of zeros occur at the recurrence times pτrecur , which are local minima of B(t).

Usually, a\nbath produces a monotonous relaxation. Here, the damping factor exp[−NB(t)], which results from the coupling of M\nwith the bath, increases between the times (p − α)τrecur and pτrecur . During these periods, the system S + M undergoes\nan “anti-damping”. This has no incidence on our measurement process, since the recurrences are anyhow killed under\nthe condition (6.29) and since their duration, τtrunc , is short compared to the delay ατrecur . One may imagine, however,\nother processes that would exhibit a similar effect.\n6.2.3. Time-dependence of physical quantities\nAll the off-diagonal physical quantities, to wit, the expectation values h ŝ x (t)i, h ŝy (t)i, and the correlations between\nŝ x or ŝy and any number of spins of the apparatus are embedded in the generating function Ψ↑↓ (λ, t) defined as in\n(5.13). As we recalled in § 6.2.1, we must sum over the discrete values (3.23) of m, rather than integrate over m; the\ndistinction between summation and integration becomes crucial when the time t reaches τrecur , since then the period\nin m of the oscillations of Pdis\n↑↓ (m, t) becomes as small as the level spacing. From (6.23), we see that the characteristic\nfunction, modified by the bath terms, has the same form as in § 5.3.2 within multiplication by exp[−NB(t)] and within\nmodification of the phase and of the width of Pdis\n↑↓ (m, t).\nLet us first consider the effect of Θ(t). Its introduction changes the phase of P↑↓ according to\n2iNgmt\n2iNgmt\n7→\n+ iNΘ(t)m.\n~\n~\n\n(6.37)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n75\n\nHence, the occurrence of the term Θ(t) might shift the recurrences, which take place when\n2gt\n+ Θ(t) = pπ.\n~\n\n(6.38)\n\nHowever, the expression of Θ(t) derived in the appendix D, Eq. (D.26),\n\n\n\"\n#\nγ        2\n2πt\n\n\nΘ(t) ∼ −    2 − 1  T + J2   1 − cos\n.\n8g δ0\nτrecur\n\n(6.39)\n\nvanishes for t = pτrecur = pπ~/2g, so that the replacement (6.34) does not affect the values of the recurrence times.\nBetween these recurrence times, the truncation makes all correlations of finite rank negligible even in the absence of\ndis\nthe bath, as if Pdis\n↑↓ did vanish; then, the phase of P↑↓ is irrelevant. Altogether, Θ(t) is completely ineffective.\nLikewise, the term D(t) is relevant only at the recurrence times. We evaluate it in Eq. (D.29) as\n\nD(pτrecur ) ' pη,\n\nη=\n\n\u0013\nπγ J2 \u0012 J2\n−1 .\n2 g 3T\n\n(6.40)\n\nThis term changes the width of the distribution Pdis\n↑↓ (m, t) by a small relative amount of order γ \u001c 1, according to\nδ0\n1\nδ0\n= ∆m(1 − pηδ20 ).\n∆m = √ 7→ ∆m p = q\n2\n2\nN\nN(1 + pηδ )\n\n(6.41)\n\n0\n\nThe width therefore increases if J2 < 3T , or decreases if J2 > 3T , but this effect is significant only if the recurrences\nare still visible, that is, if the condition (6.32) is not satisfied.\nThe expression (5.33) of the generating function is thus modified into\n\nΨ↑↓ (λ, t) = r↑↓ (0)e\n\n−NB(t)\n\n∞\nX\n\n(−1)\n\npN\n\np=−∞\n\n!2\niλ∆m p\nt − pτrecur\nexp √ + i\n.\nτtrunc\n2\n\n(6.42)\n\nThe crucial change is the presence of the damping factor exp[−NB(t)], which invalidates the periodicity (5.30) of\nΨ↑↓ (λ, t) and which inhibits the recurrences. Moreover, for any t > 0, the terms p < 0 in (6.42) are negligible, since\nthey involve (for t = 0) the factor exp[−(pτrecur /τtrunc )2 ]. Thus, under the conditions (6.27) and (6.32), the sum (6.42)\nreduces at all times to its term p = 0. Accordingly, it is legitimate to express for arbitrary times P↑↓ as\n\"\nP↑↓ (m, t) = P↑↓ (m, 0) exp\n\n#\n2iNgmt\n− NB(t) ,\n~\n\n(6.43)\n\nand to treat m as a continuous variable. As a consequence, the full density matrix of S + M, which results from (3.27),\nhas off-diagonal blocks given by\n\"\nR̂↑↓ (t) = r↑↓ (0)R̂M (0) exp\n\n#\n2iNgmt\n− NB(t) ,\n~\n\n(6.44)\n\nwhere we recall the expressions (D.15), (6.26) and (6.28) for B(t).\nAltogether, as regards the evolution of the physical quantities h ŝa m̂k (t)i (a = x or y), nothing is changed in the\nresults of § 5.1.3 on the scale t \u001c τrecur ; these results are summarized by Eq. (5.22) and illustrated by fig. 5.1. For\nt \u001d τBirrev , the factor exp[−NB(t)] makes all these off-diagonal quantities vanish irremediably, including the high-rank\ncorrelations of § 5.3.2.\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n76\n\nIn spite of the simplicity of this result, our derivation was heavy because we wanted to produce a rigorous proof.\nIt turned out that the interaction between the spins of M, which occurs both through δ0 in the initial state of M and\nthrough J2 in the dynamics generated by the bath, has a negligible effect. Taking this property for granted, treating\nM as a set of independent spins and admitting that for t \u001d ~/2πT the autocorrelation function of the bath enters the\ndynamical equation through (D.21), we present in § 9.6.1 a simpler derivation, which may be used for tutorial purposes\nand which has an intuitive interpretation: Both the precession of ŝ and the damping of R̂↑↓ (t) by the bath arise from a\ndynamical process in which each spin of M is independently driven by its interaction with S and independently relaxes\nunder the effect of the bath B.\n6.2.4. The off-diagonal bath effect, an ongoing decoherence process regulated by the tested observable\nÇa s’en va et ça revient62\nSong written by Claude François\nThe damping described above has two unusual features: on the one hand (fig. 6.1), its coefficient does not\nmonotonically decrease; on the other hand, it is governed by a resonance effect. However, it has also clearly the\nfeatures of a standard decoherence [32, 33, 40, 199, 200, 201, 202]. It takes place in the compound system S + M\nunder the influence of B which plays the role of an environment. The decay (6.29) is quasi-exponential, apart from\nnon-essential oscillations. The expression (6.33) of the irreversibility time τBirrev = 2~/NγT (for T \u001d g) is typical of a\nbath-induced decoherence: It is inversely proportional to the temperature T of B, to the number N which characterizes\nthe size of the system S + M, and to the coupling γ of this system with its environment, which is here the bath.\nNevertheless, we have stressed (§ 5.1.2) that the fundamental mechanism of the initial truncation\nof the state D̂(t)\n√\nof S + M has not such a status of decoherence. It takes place in the brief delay τtrunc = ~/ Nδ0 g, during which the\nbath does not yet have any effect. Contrary to decoherence, this dephasing process is internal to the system S + M,\nand does not involve its environment B. It is governed by the direct coupling g between S and the pointer M, as shown\nby the expression of the truncation time. It is during delays of order τtrunc that the phenomena described in section 5\noccur – decay of the average transverse components of the spin S, creation then disappearance of correlations with\nhigher and higher rank (§ 5.1.3 and fig. 5.1). The bath has no effect on this truncation proper.\nWhen the bath begins to act, that is, when NB(t) becomes significant, the truncation can be considered as practically achieved since Eq (6.27) is easily satisfied. The only tracks that remain from the original blocks R̂↑↓ (0) and\nR̂↓↑ (0) of D̂(0) are correlations of very high rank (§ 5.3.2), so that the state D̂(t) cannot be distinguished at such\ntimes from a state without off-diagonal blocks. However, if the Hamiltonian did reduce solely to ĤSA (Eq. (3.5)), the\nsimplicity of the dynamics would produce, from these hidden correlations, a revival of the initial state D̂(0), taking\nplace just before τrecur , during a delay of order τtrunc . The weak interaction γ with the bath wipes out the high rank\ncorrelations, at times t such that τtrunc \u001c t \u001c τrecur for which they are the only remainder of r↑↓ (0). Their destruction\nprevents the inverse cascade from taking place and thus suppresses all recurrences.\nThe interaction between S and M does not only produce the initial truncation of D̂ described in section 5. It is also\nan essential ingredient in the very mechanism of decoherence by the bath B. Indeed, the interaction (3.10) between M\nand B is isotropic, so that it is the coupling between S and M which should govern the selection of the basis in which\nthe suppression of recurrences will occur after the initial truncation. To understand how this ongoing preferred basis\nproblem is solved, let us return to the derivation of the expression (6.25) for the damping term B(t), valid in the time\nrange of the bath-induced irreversibility. This expression arose from the integral (D.8), to wit,\ndB 4γ sin Ωt\n=\ndt\nπ~2\n\nZ ∞\ndω K̃(ω)\n−∞\n\nΩ(cos Ωt − cos ωt)\nω2 − Ω2\n\n(6.45)\n\nwhich analyzes the influence, on the damping, of the various frequencies ω of the autocorrelation function K̃(ω) of\nthe phonon bath. The effect of the system-magnet interaction g is embedded in the frequency Ω = 2g/~ = π/τrecur ,\ndirectly related to the period of the recurrences. In appendix D, we show that the quasi-linear behaviour of B(t) results\nfrom the approximation (D.20) for the last factor of (6.45): This factor is peaked around ω = ±Ω for t \u001d ~/2πT . The\nintegral (6.45) then reduces to\n62 It goes away and back\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\ni\nγ h\ndB(t)\n= 2 K̃(Ω) + K̃(−Ω) (1 − cos 2Ωt),\ndt\n~\n\n77\n\n(6.46)\n\nthe constant part of which produces the dominant, linear term B ∝ t of (6.28). In the autocorrelation function K̃(ω)\nwhich controls the damping by B in the equation of motion of S + M, ~ω is the energy of the phonon that is created\nor annihilated by interaction with a spin of the magnet (§ 3.2.2). Thus, through a resonance effect arising from the\npeak of the integrand in (6.44), the frequency ω of the phonons that contribute to the damping adjusts itself onto the\nfrequency Ω = 2g/~ associated with the precession of the spins of the magnet under the influence of the tested spin.\nOwing to this resonance effect, the bath acts mainly through the frequency of the recurrences. Accordingly, phonons\nwith energy ~ω close to the energy ~Ω = 2g of a spin flip in M (see Eq. (3.5)) are continuously absorbed and emitted,\nand this produces the shrinking of the off-diagonal blocks R̂↑↓ and R̂↓↑ . The effect is cumulative, since B ∝ t. The\ndecoherence by the bath is thus continuously piloted by the coupling of the magnet with S.\nIn conclusion, the initial truncation and its further consolidation are in the present model the results of an interplay\nbetween the three interacting objects, S, M and B. The main effect, on the time scale τtrunc , arises from the coupling\nbetween S and the many degrees of freedom of M, and it should not be regarded as decoherence. Rather, it is\na dephasing effect as known in nuclear magnetic resonance. Viewing the magnet M as “some kind of bath or of\nenvironment”, as is often done, disregards the essential role of M: to act as the pointer that indicates the outcome\nof the quantum measurement. Such an idea also confers too much extension to the concept of bath or environment.\nDecoherence usually requires some randomness of the environment, and we have seen (§ 5.2.2) that truncation may\noccur even if the initial state of M is pure.\nB\nThe mechanisms that warrant, on a longer time scale τM\nirrev or τirrev , the permanence of the truncation can be\nregarded as adjuvants of the main initial truncation process, since they become active after all accessible off-diagonal\nexpectation values and correlations have (provisionally) disappeared. We saw in subsection 6.1 that the intervention\nof B is not necessary to entail this irreversibility, which can result from a dispersion of the coupling constants gn .\nFor the more efficient mechanism of suppression of recurrences of subsection 6.2, we have just stressed that it is a\ndecoherence process arising from the phonon thermal bath but steered by the spin-magnet coupling.\nIn section 7, we turn to the most essential role of the bath B in the measurement, to allow the registration of the\noutcome by the pointer.\n7. Registration: creation of system-pointer correlations\nWie schrijft, die blijft63\nLes paroles s’envolent, les écrits restent64\nDutch and French proverbs\nThe main issue in a measurement process is the establishment of correlations between S and A, which will allow\nus to gain information on S through observation of A [10, 11, 31, 48, 85]. As shown in § 5.1.3, the process creates\ncorrelations in the off-diagonal blocks R̂↑↓ (t) and R̂↓↑ (t) of the density matrix D̂(t) of S + A, but those which survive\nafter the brief truncation time τtrunc involve a large number of spins σ̂(n) of M and are inobservable. The considered\nquantum measurement thus cannot provide information on the off-diagonal elements r↑↓ (0) of the density matrix r̂(0)\nof S. We now show, by studying the dynamics of the diagonal blocks of D̂(t), how M can register the statistical\ninformation embedded in r↑↑ (0) and r↓↓ (0) through creation of system-apparatus correlations. This “registration”\nconcerns a large set of runs of the measurement and has a statistical nature. In order to retrieve the information\nthus transferred from S to the pointer so as to read, print or process it, we need the indication of the pointer to be\nwell-defined for each run (in spite of the quantum nature of A). We discuss this question in section 11.\nIf we can select the outcome, a question discussed in section 11, the process can be used as a preparation of S in\nthe pure state |↑i or |↓i.\n63 Who writes, stays\n64 Words fly away, writings stay\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n78\n\nThe registration process presents two qualitatively different behaviors, depending on the nature of the phase transition of the magnet, of second order if the parameters of its Hamiltonian (3.7) satisfy J2 > 3J4 , of first order if they\nsatisfy 3J4 > J2 . Recalling our discussion in § 3.3.2, we will exemplify these two situations with the two pure cases\nq = 2 and q = 4. In the former case, for J2 ≡ J and J4 = 0, the Hamiltonian is expressed by (3.8); in the latter case,\nfor J4 ≡ J and J2 = 0, it is expressed by (3.9). We summarize these two cases by HM = −(N J/q)m̂q with q = 2 and 4,\nrespectively.\n7.1. Properties of the dynamical equations\nThe dynamics of the diagonal blocks R̂↑↑ (t) of D̂(t) results for large N from the equation (4.30) for the scalar\nfunction P↑↑ (t), with initial condition P↑↑ (0) = r↑↑ (0)PM (m, 0). The initial distribution√PM (m, 0) for the magnetization\nof M, given by (3.49), is a Gaussian, peaked around m = 0 with the small width δ0 / N. We have noted (subsection\n4.4) the analogy of the equation of motion (4.30) with a Fokker-Planck equation [254] for the random variable m\nsubmitted to the effects of the thermal bath B. In this equation, which reads\n∂P↑↑\n\u0001 1 ∂2\n\u0001\n∂\n=\n−vP↑↑ +\nwP↑↑ ,\n∂t\n∂m\nN ∂m2\n\n(7.1)\n\nthe first term describes a drift, the second one a diffusion [254]. The drift velocity v(m, t) is a function of m and t\ndefined by (4.31), whereas the diffusion coefficient w↑↑ (m, t) is defined by (4.32). The normalization of P↑↑ remains\nunchanged in time:\nZ\nZ\ndmP↑↑ (m, t) =\ndmP↑↑ (m, 0) = r↑↑ (0),\n(7.2)\nso that the ratio P(m, t) = P↑↑ (m, t)/r↑↑ (0) can be interpreted as a conditional probability of m if sz = 1.\n7.1.1. Initial and Markovian regimes\nFor very short times such that t \u001c 1/Γ, we have\nK̃t (ω) ∼ 2tK(0) =\n\n~2 2\nΓ t,\n4π\n\n(7.3)\n\nand hence\nγ\nv ∼ − Γ2 mt,\nπ\n\nw∼\n\nγ 2\nΓ t.\nπ\n\nThe solution of (7.1) then provides a Gaussian which remains centered at m = 0.

Anyhow, on the considered time scale, the change in P↑↑ (m, t) is not perceptible\nsince γ \u001c 1. The registration may begin to take place only for larger times.\nThe weakness of the magnet-bath coupling γ implies that the time scale of the registration is larger than the\nmemory time ~/2πT of K(t). Then K̃t (ω) defined by (4.17) reduces to K̃(ω), that is, to (3.38). The equation of\nmotion (7.1) for P↑↑ becomes Markovian [121, 122, 197], with v and w depending only on m and not on t. As soon as\nt \u001d ~/2πT , P↑↑ thus evolves in a short-memory regime. Its equation of motion is invariant under time translation.\nThe explicit expressions (4.31) and (4.32) of v↑↑ and w become in this regime\nv(m) = γω↑ (1 − m coth β~ω↑ ),\n\n(7.6)\n\n= γω↑ (coth β~ω↑ − m),\n\n(7.7)\n\nw(m)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n79\n\nV\ng = 0.05 J\n0.2\ng=0\n0.1\n\n-1\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n1.\n\nm\n\n-0.1\n\nFigure 7.1: The drift velocity field V(m) = ~v(m)/γT = β(Jm + g)[1 − m coth β(Jm + g)] for second-order transitions (q = 2, i. e., J2 = J, J4 = 0), at\nthe temperature T = 0.65J. The fixed points, the zeroes of V(m), are the extrema of the free energy F(m). For g=0, the attractive fixed points lie at\n±mF = ±0.87. For g=0.05J, the two attractive fixed points lie at m⇑ = 0.90 and m⇓ = −0.84, and the repulsive bifurcation lies at m = −mB = −0.14.\nFor g = 0 the attractive fixed points lie at ±mF = ±0.91.\n\nwhere ~ω↑ = g + J2 m + J4 m3 (including both q = 2 and q = 4) from the definition (4.24). These functions contain in\nfact an extra factor exp(−2|ω↑ |/Γ), which we disregard since the Debye cutoff is large:\n~Γ \u001d g,\n\n~Γ \u001d J.\n\n(7.8)\n\nWhile the diffusion coefficient w(m) is everywhere positive, the drift velocity v(m) changes sign at the values m = mi\nthat are solutions of (3.56). We illustrate the behavior of v(m) in Figs. 7.1 for q = 2 and 7.2 for q = 4.\n7.1.2. Classical features\nWe have stressed (subsection 4.4) that the drift term in (7.1) is “classical”, in the sense that it comes out for large\nN by taking the continuous limit of the spectrum of m̂, and that the diffusion term, although relevant in this large N\nlimit, results from the discreteness of the spectrum of m̂ and has therefore a quantum origin. We can, however, forget\nthis origin and regard this diffusion term as a “classical” stochastic effect. As a preliminary exercise, we show below\nthat an empirical classical approach of the registration provides us at least with a drift, similar to the one occurring in\neq. (7.1).\nFor times t \u001d τtrunc it is legitimate to disregard the off-diagonal blocks R̂↑↓ and R̂↓↑ of D̂, and the process that takes\nplace later on involves only P↑↑ and P↓↓ . (In our present model the blocks evolve independently anyhow). This process\nlooks like the measurement of a “classical discrete spin” which would take only two values +1 and −1 with respective\nprobabilities r↑↑ (0) and r↓↓ (0); the x- and y-components play no role. The magnet M also behaves, in the present\ndiagonal sectors, as a collection of N classical spins σ(n)\nz , the x- and y-components of which can be disregarded. The\ndynamics of M is governed by its coupling with the thermal bath B. If this coupling is treated classically, we recover\na standard problem in classical statistical mechanics [60, 258, 259, 260, 261]. Indeed, the dynamics of\nP(m, t) =\n\nP↑↑ (m, t)\nr↑↑ (0)\n\n(7.9)\n\nis the same as the relaxation of the random order parameter m of an Ising magnet, submitted to a magnetic field h = g\nand weakly coupled to the bath B at a temperature lower than the transition temperature. Likewise, P↓↓ (m, t)/r↓↓ (0)\nbehaves as the time-dependent probability distribution for m in a magnetic field h = −g.\nSuch dynamics have been considered long since, see e.g. [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 258, 259, 260, 261]. The variables\nσ(n)\nz are regarded as c-numbers, which can take the two values ±1. Due to the presence of transverse spin components\nat the quantum level they may flip with a transition rate imposed by the bath. Since N is large, it seems natural to\nassume that the variance of m remains weak at all times, as D(t)/N. (In fact, this property fails in circumstances that\nwe shall discuss in subsection 7.3.) The probability distribution P is then equivalent to a Gaussian,\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n80\n\nV\n0.5\n\n0.25\ng = 0.054 J\n0.036 J\n-1\n\n0.018 J\n\n-0.5\n\n0.5\n\n1.\n\nm\n\ng=0\n-0.25\n\n-0.5\n\nFigure 7.2: The drift velocity field V(m) = ~v(m)/γT = β(Jm3 + g)[1 − m coth β(Jm3 + g)] for first-order transitions (q = 4, i. e., J2 = 0, J4 = J)\nat T = 0.2J and for various couplings g. The zeroes of V(m) are the extrema of the free energy F(m) (see Figs. 3.3 and 3.4). √For g = 0 there\nare three attractive fixed points, mP = 0 and ±mF with mF = 1 − 9.1 · 10−5 and two repulsive fixed points, at ±0.465, close to ± T/J = ±0.447.\nFor increasing g, mP increases up to mc = 0.268 until g reaches hc = 0.0357 J. For larger g, the paramagnetic fixed point mP disappears together\nwith the positive repulsive point, and, since V is positive for all m > 0, the distribution of m can easily move from values near 0 to values near mF ,\n“rolling down the hill” of F(m). If g is too small, V(m) vanishes with a negative slope at the attractive paramagnetic fixed point mP near the origin;\nthe distrbution of m then ends up around mP and the apparatus returns to its paramagnetic state when g is switched off so that the registration fails.\n\nr\nP(m, t) =\n\n(\n)\nN[m − μ(t)]2\nN\nexp −\n,\n2πD(t)\n2D(t)\n\n(7.10)\n\nIn the present classical approximation we neglect D, assuming that m is nearly equal to the expectation value μ(t).\nThis quantity is expected to evolve according to an equation of the form\ndμ(t)\n= v(μ(t)).\n(7.11)\ndt\nIn our case v is given by Eq. (7.6). This type of evolution has been considered many times in the literature. In order\nto establish this law and to determine the form of the function v, most authors start from a balance equation governing\nthe probability that each spin σ(n)\nz takes the values σi = ±1 (with i =↑ or ↓). The bath induces a transition probability\nWi (m) per unit time, which governs the possible flip of each spin from σi to −σi , in a configuration where the total\nP\nspin is i σi = Nm. A detailed balance property must be satisfied, relating two inverse processes, that is, relating Wi\nand W−i ; it ensures that the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution for the magnet at the temperature of the bath is stationary,\nto wit,\nW−i [m − (2/N)σi ]\n= exp[−β∆Ei (m)],\nWi (m)\n\n(7.12)\n\nwhere ∆Ei (m) is the energy brought in by one spin flip from σi to −σi . For large N, we have ∆Ei = 2σi (h + Jmq−1 )\n(which reads for general couplings ∆Ei = 2σi (h + J2 m + J4 m3 )), so that Wi (m) depends on σi as\nWi (m) =\n\n1\n[1 + tanh βσi (h + Jmq−1 )],\n2θ(m)\n\n(7.13)\n\nincluding a transition time θ(m) which may depend on m and on the temperature T = β−1 of B. (Indeed, W−i (m),\nobtained from Wi by changing σi into σ−i = −σi , satisfies (7.12).) As explained in § 4.4.3, a balance provides the\nvariation during the time dt of the probabilities Pdis (m, t) as function of the flipping probability Wi (m)dt of each spin.\nThe continuous limit then generates, as in the derivation of Eq. (4.30), the drift coefficient\nv(m) =\n\n1\n[tanh β(h + Jmq−1 ) − m].\nθ(m)\n\n(7.14)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n81\n\nVarious forms for θ(m) can be found in the works devoted to this subject; they are based either on phenomenology\nor on an approximate solution of models [258, 259, 260, 261]. In all cases the stable fixed points of the motion\n(7.11), at which v(m) vanishes, are the values mi given for large N by (3.56), where the free energy (3.55) is minimal.\nHowever, the time-dependence of μ(t) = hmi as well as the behavior of higher order cumulants of m depend on the\ncoefficient θ(m). For instance, while θ is a constant in [258], it is proportional to tanh β(h + Jmq−1 ) in [260] and [261];\nit still has another form if v(m) is taken to be proportional to −dF/dm.\nIn the present, fully quantum approach, which relies on the Hamiltonian introduced in subsection 3.2, the drift\nvelocity v(m) has been found to take the specific form (7.6) in the Markovian regime t \u001d ~/2πT . We can then identify\nthe coefficient θ(m) of (7.14) with\n~ tanh β(h + Jmq−1 )\n.\n(7.15)\nθ(m) =\nγ(h + Jmq−1 )\nWith this form of θ(m), which arises from a quantum microscopic theory, the dynamical equation (7.11) keeps a\nsatisfactory behavior when h or m becomes negative, contrary to the ad hoc choice θ(m) ∝ tanh β(h + Jmq−1 ). It\nprovides, for q = 2, as shown in § 7.3.2, a long lifetime for the paramagnetic state, and better low temperature features\nthan for θ(m) =constant.\nAltogether, our final equations for the evolution of the diagonal blocks of D̂ are, at least in the Markovian regime,\nsimilar to equations readily found from a classical phenomenology. However, the quantum starting point and the\nrather realistic features of our model provide us unambiguously with the form (7.6) for the drift velocity, which meets\nseveral natural requirements in limiting cases. The occurrence of Planck’s constant in (7.15) reveals the quantum\norigin of our classical-like equation. Moreover, quantum mechanics is also at the origin of the diffusion term and it\nprovides the explicit form (7.7) for w. Finally, by varying the parameters of the model, we can discuss the validity of\nthis equation and explore other regimes.\n7.1.3. H-theorem and dissipation\nIn order to exhibit the dissipative nature of our quantum equations of motion for P↑↑ and P↓↓ in the Markovian\nregime, we establish here an associated H-theorem [254]. This theorem holds for any Markovian dynamics, with\nor without detailed balance. We start from the general, discrete equation (4.16), valid even for small N, where\nK̃t (ω) is replaced by K̃(ω). We consider the probability Pdis (m, t) = (2/N)P(m, t), normalized under summation,\ndis\nwhich encompasses Pdis\n↑↑ (m, t)/r↑↑ (0) for h = g > 0 and P↓↓ (m, t)/r↓↓ (0) for h = −g < 0, and denote as E(m) =\n−1 q\n−hNm − JNq m the Hamiltonian (4.6) with h = ±g. We associate with Pdis (m, t) the time-dependent entropy\nS (t) = −\n\nX\n\nPdis (m, t) ln\n\nm\n\nPdis (m, t)\n,\nG(m)\n\nwhere the denominator G(m) accounts for the multiplicity (3.24) of m, and the average energy\nX\nU(t) =\nPdis (m, t)E(m).\n\n(7.16)\n\n(7.17)\n\nm\n\nThe time-dependence of the dynamical free energy Fdyn (t) = U(t) − T S (t) is found by inserting the equations of\nmotion (4.16) for the set P(m, t) into\n\"\n#\ndFdyn X dPdis (m, t)\nPdis (m, t)\n=\nE(m) + T ln\n.\n(7.18)\ndt\ndt\nG(m)\nm\nThe resulting expression is simplified through summation by parts, using\nX\u0002\nX\nX\n\u0003\n∆+ f1 (m) f2 (m) =\nf1 (m)[∆− f2 (m)] = −\nf1 (m+ )[∆+ f2 (m)],\nm\n\nm\n\n(7.19)\n\nm\n\nwith the notations (4.15).

Thus the dynamical free energy is a decreasing function of time. The quantity −βdFdyn /dt can be\ninterpreted as the dissipation rate (or the entropy production) of the compound system M+B, that is, the increase per\nunit time of the entropy (7.16) of the magnet plus the increase −βdU/dt of the entropy of the bath. In fact the entropy\nof M is lower in the final state than in the initial state, but the increase of entropy of B associated with the energy\ndumping dominates the balance. The negativity of (7.21) characterizes the irreversibility of the registration.\nThe right-hand side of (7.21) vanishes only if all its terms vanish, that is, if Pdis (m, t) exp[βE(m)]/G(m) does\nnot depend on m. This takes place for large times, when the dynamical free energy F(t) has decreased down to the\nminimum allowed by the definitions (7.16), (7.17). We then reach the limit Pdis (m) ∝ G(m) exp[−βE(m)], which\nis the distribution associated with the canonical equilibrium of M for the Hamiltonian E(m̂), that is, with the static\nfree energy65 . We have thus proven for our model the following property, often encountered in statistical physics\n[197, 254]. The same probability distribution for m arises in two different circumstances. (i) In equilibrium statistical\nmechanics, (§ 3.3.4), Pdis (m) follows from the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution R̂M ∝ exp[−βĤM ] for the magnet alone.\n(ii) In non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, it comes out as the asymptotic distribution reached in the long time limit\nwhen M is weakly coupled to the bath.\nIt is only in the Markovian regime that the dynamical free energy is ensured to decrease. Consider in particular,\nfor the quadratic coupling q = 2, the evolution of Pdis (m, t) on very short times, which involves the narrowing (7.5)\nof the initial peak. The free energy associated with a Gaussian distribution centered at m = 0, with a time-dependent\nvariance D(t)/N, is\n#\nPdis (m, t)\n1\n1\n2\n= − (JD + T − T D + T ln D).\nFdyn (t) =\nP (m, t) −gNm − JNm + T ln\n2\nG(m)\n2\nm\nX\n\n\"\n\ndis\n\n(7.22)\n\nThe time-dependence of D is expressed for short times t \u001c Γ−1 by (7.5).

In fact, the negative sign of v in the initial non-Markovian regime (7.4) indicates that, for very\nshort times, the fixed point near m = 0 is stable although the bath temperature is lower than J.\n7.1.4. Approach to quasi-equilibrium\nThe above proof that the system eventually reaches the canonical equilibrium state R̂M ∝ exp(−βĤM ) is mathematically correct for finite N and t → ∞. However, this result is not completely relevant physically in the large N\nlimit. Indeed, the times that we consider should be attainable in practice, and “large times” does not mean “infinite\ntimes” in the mathematical sense [55, 56].\nIn order to analyze this situation, we note that the summand of (7.21) contains a factor Pdis (m, t); thus the ranges\nof m over which Pdis (m, t) is not sizeable should be disregarded. When the time has become sufficiently large so that\nthe rate of decrease of F(t) has slowed down, a regime is reached where Pdis (m, t) exp[βE(m)]/G(m) is nearly timeindependent and nearly constant (as function of m) in any interval where Pdis (m, t) is not small. Within a multiplicative\nfactor, Pdis (m, t) is then locally close to exp[−βF(m)] where F(m) = U(m) − T ln G(m) is given by (3.55). It is thus\n65 The notions of dynamical (moderate time) and static (infinite time) free energy are well known in the theory of glasses and spin glasses, see e.g.\n[262, 263, 264]. In corresponding mean field models, they differ strongly; here, however, the dynamical free energy simply refers to processes close\nto equilibrium and decreases down to the static equilibrium free energy in agreement with the macroscopic Clausius–Duhem inequality [56, 73]\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n83\n\n√\nconcentrated in peaks, narrow as 1/ N and located in the vicinity of points mi where F(m) has a local minimum.\nAbove the transition temperature, or when the field h = ±g is sufficiently large, there is only one such peak, and the\nasymptotic form of Pdis (m, t) is unique. However, below the critical temperature, two separate peaks may occur for\nq = 2, and two or three peaks for q = 4, depending on the size of h.\nIn such a case, Pdis (m, t) can be split into a sum of non-overlapping contributions Pdis\nMi (m, t), located respectively\nnear mi and expected to evolve towards the equilibrium distributions Pdis\n(m)\nexpressed\nby\n(3.57). Since for sufficiently\nMi\nlong times Pdis (m, t) is concentrated around its maxima mi with a shape approaching the Gaussian (3.57), its equation\nof motion (7.1) does not allow for transfers from one peak to another over any reasonable delay. (Delays exponentially\nlarge with N are physically inaccessible.) Once such a regime has been attained, each term Pdis\nMi (m, t) evolves independently according to (7.1). Its normalization remains constant, and its shape tends asymptotically to (3.57). Hence,\nbelow the transition temperature, ergodicity is broken in the physical sense. (A breaking of ergodicity may occur in\na mathematically rigorous sense only for infinite N or zero noise.) If the system starts from a configuration close to\nsome mi , it explores, during a physically large time, only the configurations for which m lies around mi . Configurations with the same energy but with values of m around other minima of F(m) remain out of reach. This phenomenon\nis essential if we want to use M as the pointer of a measurement apparatus. If the spin S lies upwards, its interaction\nwith A should lead to values of m that fluctuate weakly around +mF , not around −mF . Ergodicity would imply that\nA spends the same average time in all configurations having the same energy, whatever the sign of m [55, 56], once\nthe interaction ĤSA is turned off. The breaking of invariance is thus implemented through the dynamics: unphysical\ntimes, exponentially large with N, would be needed to reach the symmetric state exp(−βĤM ).\nIn analogy with what happens in glasses and spin glasses [262, 263, 264], for physical large times t, the asymptotic\nvalue of Fdyn (t) is not necessarily the absolute minimum of F(m). It is a weighted average of the free energies of the\nstable and metastable states, with magnetizations mi . The weights, that is, the normalizations of the contributions\ndis\ndis\nPdis\nMi (m, t) to P (m, t) are determined by the initial distribution P (m, 0), and they depend on N and on the couplings\ng and J which enter the equations of motion. For an ideal measurement, we require the process to end up at a single\ndis\npeak, +mF for Pdis\n↑↑ , −mF for P↓↓ (subsection 7.2). Otherwise, if M may reach either one of the two ferromagnetic\nstates ±mF , the measurement is not faithful; we will determine in § 7.3.3 its probability of failure.\nIn the present regime where the variations with m of PeβE /G are slow, we can safely write the continuous limit of\nthe H-theorem (7.21) by expressing the discrete variations ∆+ over the interval δm = 2/N as derivatives. We then find\nthe dissipation rate as (we switch to the function P(m) = (N/2)Pdis (m) and to an integral over m)\n\n−\n\n1 dFdyn\nT dt\n\n=\n×\n\nZ\nγNT\ndm P(m, t)φ(m)[coth φ(m) − m]\n~\n\"\n#\"\n#\n1 ∂P\ntanh φ(m) − m\n1 ∂P\n1 1+m\n−\n− φ(m) + ln\n,\nNP ∂m 1 − m tanh φ(m) NP ∂m\n2 1−m\n\n(7.24)\n\nwhere we use the notation\nφ(m) = β(h + Jmq−1 ),\n\nh = ±g.\n\n(7.25)\n\nFor large N, the term√(1/NP)dP/dm is not negligible in case ln P is proportional to N, that is, in the vicinity of a narrow\nP\npeak with width 1/ N. The expression (7.24) is not obviously positive. However, once P(m, t) = i=±1 PMi (m, t)\nhas evolved into a sum of separate terms represented by peaks around the values mi , we can write the dissipation as\na sum of contributions, each of which we expand around mi . The last two brackets of (7.24) then differ only at order\n(m − mi )3 , and we get the obviously positive integrand\nZ\n1 dFdyn γNT X\n−\n=\ndm PMi (m, t)φ(m)[coth φ(m) − m]\n(7.26)\nT dt\n~ i=±1\n\n\n2\n\n\nmi\n(q − 1)(q − 2)\n1 ∂PMi     1\n\n\nq−2\nq−3\n2\n\n\n−\n×\n+\n−\n(q\n−\n1)βJm\n(m\n−\nm\n)\n+\nβJm\n(m\n−\nm\n)\n\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\nNPMi ∂m\n.\n2\n2 2\n2\n1 − mi\n(1 − mi )\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n84\n\nWe thus check that Fdyn (t) decreases, down to the weighted sum of free energies associated with the stable or\nmetastable equilibrium distributions (3.57). In fact, among the stationary solutions of (7.1), those which satisfy\nvP −\n\n1 d(wP)\n= 0,\nN dm\n\n(7.27)\n\nwith v and w given by (7.6) and (7.7), coincide with (3.57) around the values of mi given by (3.56), not only in the\nmean-field approximation but also including the corrections that we retained in those formulae.\n7.2. Registration times\nQuid est ergo tempus? Si nemo ex me quaerat, scio;\nsi quaerenti explicare velim, nescio 66\nSaint Augustine\nIn the present subsection, we study the evolution of the distribution P↑↑ (m, t), which is such that (1/N) ln P↑↑ is\nfinite for large N. This property\nholds at t = 0 and hence at all times. As a consequence, P↑↑ presents a narrow\n√\npeak with width of order 1/ N, and it is equivalent to a Gaussian. We first note that the evolution (7.1) conserves its\nnormalization r↑↑ (0). The ratio (7.9) can then be parametrized as in (7.10) by the position μ(t) of the peak and by its\nwidth parameter D(t), which are both finite for large N.\n7.2.1. Motion of a single narrow peak\nThe equations of motion for μ(t) and D(t) are derived by taking the first moments of the equation\n(7.1) for P↑↑ (m, t).\nR\nIntegration over m of (7.1) first entails the conservation in time of the normalization r↑↑ (0) of dmP↑↑ (m, t). We then\nintegrate (7.1) over m after multiplication, first by m − μ(t), second by N[m − μ(t)]2 − D(t), using on the right-hand side\nan integration by parts and the steepest descents method. To wit, expanding v(m, t) and w(m, t) in powers of m − μ(t),\nwe rely on the vanishing of the integrals of m − μ(t) and of N[m − μ(t)]2 − D(t) when weighted by P↑↓ (m, t), and we\nneglect for k > 1 the integrals of [m − μ(t)]2k , which are small as N −k . This yields for sufficiently large N\ndμ(t)\ndt\n1 dD(t)\n2 dt\n\n=\n\nv[μ(t), t],\n\n(7.28)\n\n=\n\n∂v[μ(t), t]\nD(t) + w[μ(t), t].\n∂μ\n\n(7.29)\n\nAt the very beginning of the evolution, when t is not yet large compared to ~/2πT , Eqs. (7.28) and (7.29) should\nbe solved self-consistently, using the expressions (4.31) for v and (4.32) for w. However, if the coupling γ is weak,\nthe Markovian regime is reached before the shape of P↑↑ is significantly changed. We can thus solve (7.28) and (7.29)\nwith the time-independent forms (7.6) and (7.7) for v and w, the initial conditions being μ(0) = 0 , D(0) = δ20 .\nThe solution of (7.28) is then, for t \u001d ~/2πT ,\nZ μ\nZ μ\ndμ0\n~\ndμ0\nt=\n=\n,\n(7.30)\n0\nγT 0 φ(μ0 )[1 − μ0 coth φ(μ0 )]\n0 v(μ )\nwhere the function φ is defined by (7.25) with h = +g. Inversion of (7.30) provides the motion μ(t) of the peak of\nP↑↑ (m, t). For P↓↓ , we have to change g into −g in (7.25), and μ (t) expressed by (7.30) is then negative.\nIf N is very large, the probabilistic nature of the registration process fades out and the magnetization is located\nat μ(t) with near certainty. The evaluation of the time dependence of μ(t) may be proposed to students as an exercise\n(§ 9.6.2). Results for quadratic coupling (q = 2) and for quartic coupling (q = 4), which exemplify second and\nfirst-order transitions, respectively, are illustrated by Fig. 7.3 and by Fig. 7.4, respectively. The evolution from the\ninitial paramagnetic state to the final ferromagnetic state exhibits several stages, which will be studied in § 7.2.3 for\nq = 2 and in § 7.2.4 for q = 4.\n66 What then is time?

The characteristic registration\ntime τreg = 38τ J is now given by (7.52). (Note that it is much larger than for a quadratic interaction.) The initial increase of μ(t) takes place, first\nlinearly as (g/J) t/τ J = 0.045t/τ J , then slows down according to (7.51), with a coefficient g/J = 0.045 and a time scale τ1 = (g/J) τ J . The region\nof mc = 0.268, where the drift velocity is small, is a bottleneck: around this point, reached at the time t = 21 τreg , the average magnetization μ(t)\nlingers according to (7.53) where δmc = 0.11. It then increases rapidly so as to reach at the time τreg a value close to mF ' 1, and finally reaches\nmF exponentially on the time scale τ J .\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n86\n\nThe width of the peak is obtained by regarding D as a function of μ(t) and by solving the equation for dD/dμ that\nresults from (7.28) and (7.29).

This\nsimplified equation describes a deterministic flow in the space of m, with a local drift velocity v(m). For any initial\ncondition, its solution is the mapping\n!\nZ\nZ m\n1\ndm00\n0\n0\nPM (m, t) =\ndm PM (m , 0) δ t −\n,\n(7.32)\n00\nv(m)\nm0 v(m )\nwhere m0 is the initial point of the trajectory that reaches m at the time t. For a distribution (7.10) peaked at all times,\nwe recover from (7.32) the motion (7.30) of the maximum of P↑↑ (m, t) and the first term of the variance (7.31). If only\nthe drift term were present, the width of the peak would vary as v(μ): Indeed, in a range of m where the drift velocity\nincreases with m, the front of the peak progresses more rapidly than its tail so that the width increases, and conversely.\nThe second term of (7.31) arises from the term in w. Since w(m) is positive, it describes a diffusion which widens\nthe distribution. This effect of w is enhanced when v is small. In particular, by the end of the evolution when μ(t)\ntends to a zero mi of v(m) with ∂v/∂m < 0, the competition between the narrowing through v and the widening\nthrough w leads to the equilibrium variance D = −(dv/dμ)−1 w, irrespective of the initial width. This value is given by\nD−1 = (1 − m2i )−1 − (q − 1)βJmq−2\ni , in agreement with (3.57) and with (7.27).\nWe have noted that the drift velocity v(m) has at each point the same sign as −dF/dm, where F is the free energy\n(3.55), and that the zeroes mi of v(m), which are the fixed points of the drift motion, coincide with the extrema of F.\nAt such an extremum, given by (3.56), we have\n−\n\ndv\nγ\n2φ(mi ) d2 F\n=\n.\ndm N~ sinh 2φ(mi ) dm2\n\n(7.33)\n\nThe minima of F correspond to attractive fixed points, with negative slope of v(m), its maxima to repulsive points,\nthat is, bifurcations. In the present case of a narrow distribution, μ(t) thus increases from μ(0) = 0 to the smallest\npositive minimum mi of F(m), which is reached asymptotically for large times. However, the present hypothesis of a\nsingle narrow peak is valid only if P(m, t) lies entirely and at all times in a region of m free of bifurcations. We will\ndiscuss in subsection 7.3 the situation where P lies astride a bifurcation, either at the initial time or a little later on, if\na tail due to diffusion crosses the bifurcation.\n7.2.2. Threshold for the system-apparatus coupling; possibilities of failure\nIf you are not big enough to lose,\nyou are not big enough to win\nWalter Reuther\nThe measurement is successful only if P (m, t) ≡ P↑↑ (m, t)/r↑↑ (0), which is interpreted as the conditional probability distribution for m if sz = +1, approaches for large times the narrow normalized peak (3.57) located at the positive\nferromagnetic solution m⇑ of (3.56) with h = +g, close to mF for g \u001c T 67 . This goal can be achieved only if (i) the\ncenter μ(t) of the peak approaches m⇑ ; (ii) its width remains small at all times so that the above derivation is valid.\n(i) The first condition is relevant only for a first-order transition (q = 4), since m⇑ is anyhow the only attractive\nfixed point in the region m > 0 for a second-order transition (q = 2). For quartic interactions, the first minimum of\nF(m) that occurs for increasing m is not necessarily m⇑ (Fig. 7.2). Indeed, we have seen (end of § 3.3.4 and Fig. 3.4)\nthat for a field lower than\n67 We recall Eq. (3.58) where m ' +1 and m ' −1 are defined as the fixed points at finite g, and m and −m as their g → 0 limits, respectively\nF\nF\n⇑\n⇓\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n87\n\nr\n\n4T\nT\nT2\n≈\n+ 2,\n(7.34)\n3\n2 2\n3J\n3J 9J\nthe free energy F(m) has not only a ferromagnetic minimum at m⇑ , but also a local paramagnetic minimum mP at a\nsmaller value of m. Hence, if the spin-apparatus coupling g is smaller than hc , μ(t) reaches for large times the locally\nstable point mP in the sector ↑↑. It reaches −mP in the sector ↓↓, so that the apparatus seems to distinguish the values\nsz = ±1 of S. However, if the coupling is switched off at the end of the process, the magnetization m of M returns to 0\nin both cases. The result of the measurement thus cannot be registered robustly for g < hc .\nThe center μ(t) of the peak may escape the region of the origin only if g > hc (Fig. 7.2). Relying on the smallness\nof T/3J (equal to 0.121 at the transition temperature), we can simplify the expression of hc as in (7.34), so that this\nthreshold for g is (q = 4):\nr\nT\n2T\n.\n(7.35)\ng > hc '\n3\n3J\nUnder this condition, the peak μ(t) of P↑↑ (m, t) reaches for large times m⇑ , close to the magnetization mF of the\nferromagnetic state. If the coupling g is removed sufficiently after μ(t) has passed the maximum of F(m), the peak is\nexpected to end up at mF . Likewise, the peak of P↓↓ (m, t) reaches −mF at the end of the same process. The apparatus\nis non-ergodic and the memory of its triggering by S may be kept forever under the necessary (but not sufficient)\ncondition (7.35).\n(ii) The second requirement involves the width of the distribution P↑↑ (m, t) and the location −mB < 0 of the\nrepulsive fixed point, at which F(m) is maximum. Consider first the pure drift flow (7.32) without diffusion, for which\n−mB is a bifurcation. The part m > −mB of P↑↑ (m, 0) is properly shifted upwards so as to reach eventually the vicinity\nof the positive ferromagnetic value +mF ; however its tail m < −mB is pushed towards the negative magnetization\n−mF . If the relative weight of this tail is not negligible, false measurements, for which the value −mF is registered\nby A although sz equals +1, can occur√with a sizeable probability. Such a failure is excluded for q = 4, because mB\nis then much larger than the width 1/ N of P↑↑ (m, 0); for instance, in the case q = 4 we have mB = 0.544 for the\nparameters T = 0.2J and g = 0.045J (which satisfy (7.35)). However, in the case q = 2 and g \u001c J − T , the point\n−mB with\n2\nhc = T arctanh mc − Jm3c ≈ T mc ,\n\n1 1\nm2c = −\n\n1−\n\ng\n,\n(7.36)\nJ−T\nlies close to the origin (Fig. 7.1), and a risk exists that the initial Gaussian distribution in exp(−Nm2 /2δ20 ) extends\n√\nbelow −mB if g is too small. The probability of getting a wrong result is significant if the condition δ0 \u001c mB N is\nnot fulfilled. We return to this point in § 7.3.3.\nMoreover, in this case q = 2, the lower bound thus guessed for the coupling,\nmB '\n\ng = (J − T )mB\n\n(J − T )δ0\n,\n√\nN\n\n(7.37)\n\nis not sufficient to ensure a faithful registration. The diffusive process, which tends to increase D(t) and thus to thicken\nthe dangerous tail m < −mB of the probability distribution P↑↑ (m, t), raises the probability of a false registration\ntowards −mF instead of +mF . In order to trust the Ansatz (7.10) and the ensuing solution (7.30), (7.31) for P↑↑ (m, t),\nwe need D(t) to remain at all times sufficiently small so that P↑↑ (m, t) is negligible for m < −mB .

Altogether, for q = 2 the system-apparatus coupling may for\nlarge N be small, for instance as N 1/3 , provided it satisfies (7.41).\nFor q = 4, and more generally for a first-order transition (3J4 > J2 ), the lower bound found as (7.35) remains\nfinite for large N: A free energy barrier of order N has to be overpassed. Moreover, the diffusion hinders the trend\nof m to increase and may push part of the distribution P↑↑ (m, t) leftwards, especially its left tail, while its peak moves\nrightwards. The widening of P↑↑ (m, t) when the barrier is being reached should not be too large, and this effect raises\nfurther the threshold for g. We shall show in § 7.2.4 that the condition (7.35) should thus be strengthened into (7.57).\nAnother difference between first- and second order transitions lies in the possible values of the temperature. For\nq = 2, if T lies near the critical temperature J, the\n√ minima mi of F(m) are very sensitive to g and the ferromagnetic\nvalue mF in the absence of a field is small as 3(J − T )/J. Using M as the pointer of a measurement apparatus\nrequires the temperature to lie sufficiently below J. For q = 4, registration is still possible if T lies near the transition\ntemperature, and even above, although in this case the ferromagnetic states are not the most stable ones for h = 0.\nHowever, the coupling g should then be sufficiently strong.\n7.2.3. The registration process for a second-order transition\nAssuming g to satisfy (7.41) and mF to be significantly large, we resume the dynamics of P↑↑ (m, t) for q = 2 so as\nto exhibit its characteristic times. After a short delay of order ~/T , most of the process takes place in the Markovian\nregime, and the Gaussian Ansatz (7.10) is justified. We can distinguish three stages in the evolution of P↑↑ (m, t),\nwhich are exhibited on the example of Figs. 7.3 and 7.5.\n(i) During the first stage, as long as μ(t) \u001c mF , we can replace φ(m) coth φ(m) by 1 in v and w, so that the drift\nvelocity v behaves (Fig. 7.1) as\n\u0015 γ(J − T )(m + m)\nγT \u0014 g + Jm\nB\nv(m) ≈\n−m =\n,\n(7.42)\n~\nT\n~\nand the diffusion coefficient as w ≈ γT/~. Integration of (7.30) then yields the motion\nμ(t) ∼ mB (et/τreg − 1) =\n\ng\n(et/τreg − 1)\nJ−T\n\n(7.43)\n\nfor the center of the peak, with the characteristic time\nτreg =\n\n~\n.\nγ(J − T )\n\n(7.44)\n\nAfter beginning to move as μ ∼ γgt/~, the distribution shifts away from the origin faster and faster. Once μ has\nreached values of the order of several times mB , (J − T ) μ becomes larger than g, so that v(μ) does not depend much\non g. It little matters for the subsequent evolution whether the coupling g is present or not. Thus, after t/τreg reaches\n2 or 3, the spin-apparatus coupling may be switched off and the increase of μ goes on nearly unchanged. In fact, the\ndistribution moves towards mF rather than m⇑ , but mF −m⇑ is small, less than g/J. We shall call τreg the first registration\ntime. After it, M will necessarily reach the ferromagnetic state +mF , independent of S, although the evolution is not\nachieved yet.\nWe have seen that during this first stage the width (7.39) is governed both by the drift which yields the factor\n(mB + μ)2 , increasing as e2t/τreg , and by the diffusion which raises δ0 up to δ1 .\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n89\n\n(ii) During the second stage μ(t) rises rapidly from mB to mF , since the drift velocity v(μ) is no longer small. The\ndistribution has become wide, and its width is now governed mainly by the drift term. Matching D(μ) with (7.39) for\nμ larger than mB yields the width\nr\nτreg δ1\nD(μ)\n~δ1\n∼\n(7.45)\n√ v(μ) =\n√ v(μ),\nN\nmB N\nγg N\nwhich varies proportionally to v (μ).The drift velocity v(m) first increases and then decreases as function of m (Fig.\n7.1), down to 0 for m = m⇑ ' mF . Accordingly, the width D(t) increases as function of time, then decreases (Fig. 7.5).\nThe time dependence (7.30) of μ(t) and hence of D(t) is evaluated explicitly in the Appendix E.1, where μ is related\nto t through Eq.

From the equation (7.46) that relates μ to t, we find this\nsecond registration time, the duration of the second stage, much longer than the first, as\nτ0reg = τreg (1 + a) ln\n\nmF\n,\nmB\n\n(7.48)\n\n(iii) The third stage of the registration, the establishment of thermal equilibrium, has been studied in § 7.1.3\nand § 7.1.4. While μ(t) tends exponentially to m⇑ (or to mF if the coupling g has been switched off), we saw that\nthe equilibrium width of P↑↑ (m, t) is reached as a result of competition between the drift, which according to (7.45)\nnarrows the distribution, and the diffusion which becomes again relevant and tends to widen it. It is shown in the\nAppendix E.1 that the final relaxation takes place, for times t − τ0reg ∼ τreg , according to\n\n!1/a\n!\n\n\n1\nm\nt\nF\n.\nμ(t) = mF    1 −\nexp −\n2 mB\naτreg\n\n(7.49)\n\nAt low temperatures, T \u001c J, we have mF ∼ 1, mB ∼ g/J, a ∼ 1. If T lies close to the transition temperature,\nJ − T \u001c J, we have m2F ∼ 3(J − T )/J, mB = g/(J − T ) and a ∼ 12 .\nThe above scenario for the registration process is illustrated by Fig. 7.5 which represents a numerical solution of\nthe equation for P (m, t) = P↑↑ (m, t)/r↑↑ (0). The curves exhibit the motion from 0 to mF of the\n√ center μ(t) of the peak\n(also shown by Fig. 7.3), its large initial widening, the intermediate regime where the width D(t)/N is proportional\nto μ(t), and the final adjustment of μ and D to their equilibrium values in the ferromagnetic state. Except near the\ninitial and final state, the width is not small although we have taken a fairly large value N = 1000, but one can see\nthat the Gaussian approximation used for P↑↑ (m, t) is sufficient and that the resulting formulae given above for μ(t)\nand D(t) fit the curves. But while a mean-field theory neglecting the fluctuations is satisfactory at equilibrium, the\ndynamics entails large fluctuations of m at intermediate times.\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n90\n\nP\n10\n\n25\n6\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n4\n\ntΤ reg =\n0\n\n3\n5\n\n-1.0\n\n0.25\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n1.0\n\nm\n\nFigure 7.5: The registration process for a quadratic interaction (q = 2). The probability density P(m, t) = P↑↑ (m, t)/r↑↑ (0) for the magnetization m\nof M is represented at different times. The parameters were chosen as N = 1000, T = 0.65J and g = 0.05J as in Figs. 7.1 and 7.3. The time scale is\nhere the registration time τreg = ~/γ(J − T ) = 2.86 τ J . After a few times τreg the evolution is no longer sensitive to the system-apparatus coupling\n√\ng. In the initial fully disordered paramagnetic state (T 0 = ∞), P(m, 0) is a Gaussian centered at m = 0 with width 1/ N. In the course of time,\nthe peak of P considerably widens, then narrows and reaches eventually the equilibrium ferromagnetic distribution with positive magnetization\nm⇑ = 0.90, which is given by (3.57). The repulsive fixed point lies at −mB with mB = 0.14 and no weight is found below this. The second\nregistration time, at which μ(t) reaches 0.80, is τ0reg = 3τreg . It is seen that beyond this, the peak at m⇑ quickly builds up.\n\n7.2.4. The registration process for a first-order transition\nThere is a star above us which unites souls of the first order,\nthough worlds and ages separate them\nChristina, Queen of Sweden\nThe process is different when the interaction is quartic (q = 4), a case that we chose to exemplify the first-order\ntransitions which occur when 3J4 > J2 . The spin-apparatus coupling g must then at least be larger than the threshold\n(7.35) to ensure that v(m) remains positive up to m⇑ , which now lies near mF ' 1 (Figs. 3.3 and 7.2). At the beginning\nof the evolution, we find from v(m) ≈ (γ/~)(g − T m), using g \u001c T , the motion\nμ(t) ≈\n\ng\n(1 − e−t/τ1 ),\nT\n\nτ1 =\n\n~\n.\nγT\n\n(7.50)\n\nLike for q = 2, the peak shifts first as μ ∼ γgt/~, but here its motion slows down as t increases, instead of escaping\nmore and more rapidly off the paramagnetic region, as exhibited on the example of Figs. 7.4 and 7.6. Extrapolation\nof (7.50) towards times larger than τ1 is not possible, since μ would then not go beyond g/T , and could not reach mF .\nIn fact, v(m) does not vanish at m = g/T as implied by the above approximation but only decreases down to a positive\nminimum near mc ' 3hc /2T according to (7.34). The vicinity of mc is thus a bottleneck for the motion from μ = 0 to\nμ = 1 of the peak of P↑↑ (m, t): This motion is the slowest around mc . The determination of the evolution of P↑↑ (m, t),\nembedded in μ(t) and D(t), and the evaluation of the registration time thus require a control of the shape of v(m), not\nonly near its zeroes, but also near its minimum (Fig. 7.2).\nLet us recall the parameters which characterize v(m). For g = 0, it has 5 zeroes. Three of them correspond to\nthe attractive fixed points ±mF ' ±1 and 0 associated with the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic\nstates. The other two\n√\n√\nare repulsive, producing a bifurcation in the flow of P(m, t); they are located at m ' ± T/J, that is, at m ' ±mc 3\naccording to (7.34). When\n√ g increases and becomes larger than hc , there remain the two ferromagnetic points, while\n√\nthe repulsive point −mc 3 is shifted towards −mB ' −2mc . The paramagnetic point and the repulsive point mc 3\nconverge towards each other, giving rise to the minimum of v(m) near m = mc . The value of v(m) at this minimum is\nexpressed by\nδm2c\n~\nv(mc ) '\n,\nγT\nmc\n\nr\nδmc '\n\n(g − hc )mc\n,\nT\n\n2\nhc ' T mc ,\n3\n\nr\nmc =\n\nT\n.\n3J\n\n(7.51)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n91\n\nWe construct in Appendix E.2, for δmc \u001c mc and mc small, a parametrization of v(m) which reproduces all these\nfeatures, so as to derive an algebraic approximation (E.12) which expresses the time dependence of μ(t) over all times.\nAfter the initial evolution (7.50) of μ(t) for t \u001c τ1 = ~/γT , the motion of the peak P↑↑ (m, t) is characterized by a\nmuch larger time scale. We define the registration time as\nπ~\nτreg =\nγT\n\ns\n\nmc T\n.\ng − hc\n\n(7.52)\n\nThe bottleneck stage takes place around 21 τreg . Between the times t = 14 τreg and t = 43 τreg , the average magnetization\nμ(t) lingers in the narrow range mc ± δmc , according to (Fig. 7.4)\nμ(t) = mc − δmc cotan\n\nπt\n.\nτreg\n\n(7.53)\n\nIt is shown in Appendix E.2 that, under the considered conditions on the parameters, μ(t) rises thereafter rapidly\naccording to (E.15), and that the full time taken by the peak μ(t) of P↑↑ (m, t) to go from 0 to the close vicinity of 1 is\nτreg (Eq. (7.52)). It is also shown in Appendix E.2 that the final relaxation takes place on the short time scale ~/γJ.\nWe have focused on the location of the peak of P↑↑ (m, t). The consideration of its width D(t) is essential to\ndetermine when S and A may be decoupled. During the bottleneck stage, the sole drift effect would produce a\nnarrowing of D(t) around t = 21 τreg expressed by the first term of (7.31), but the smallness of v(m) enhances the\nsecond term, so that the diffusion acts during a long time and produces a large widening of D(t). By using the\nparabolic approximation for v(m), which is represented by the first term of (E.11), and by replacing w(m) by γT/~,\nwe obtain, with μ(t) expressed by (7.53),\niZ μ\nh\ndμ0\n.\n(7.54)\nD(μ) ∼ 2mc (μ − mc )2 + δm2c\n2 3\n0\n2\n0 [(μ − mc ) + δmc ]\nAfter the bottleneck has been passed, the diffusion may again be neglected. From (7.31) and (7.54), we find for all\nvalues of μ(t) such that μ − mc \u001d δmc\n√\n3π~2 m3c 2\n3π T mc\nD(μ) ∼ 2 2 5 v (μ) =\n(Jμ3 + g)2 [1 − μ coth β(Jμ3 + g)]2 ,\n(7.55)\n4(g − hc )5/2\n4γ T δmc\nwhere we used (7.6), (7.51) and (4.24). Without any diffusion, the\nv2 (μ) would have been 1/v2 (0) =\n√ coefficient of\n2\n2 2 2\n5/2\n9~ /4γ T mc ; both factors v(μ) are multiplied by the large factor π/3(mc /δmc ) due to diffusion.\n√\nThe distribution P↑↑ (m, t) thus extends, at times larger than 34 τreg , over the region μ(t) ± D(t)/N. The first\nregistration time has been defined in § 7.2.3 as the time after which S and A can be decoupled\n√ without affecting the\nprocess. When g is switched off (g → 0), a repulsive fixed point appears at the zero m = mc 3 of v(m). In order to\nensure a proper registration we need this decoupling to take place after the whole distribution P↑↑ (m, t) has passed this\nbifurcation, that is, at a time toff such that\nμ(toff ) −\n\np\n\n√\nD(toff )/N > mc 3.\n\n(7.56)\n\nThe time dependence (E.15) of μ shows that the lower bound of toff is equal to τreg within a correction of order\nτ1 \u001c τreg . Moreover, we need the distribution to be sufficiently narrow so that (7.56) is satisfied after g is switched\noff. Taking for instance μ(toff ) = 2mc , which according to (E.15) is reached at the time toff = τreg (1 − 0.25 δmc /mc ),\nwe thus find, by inserting (7.55) with μ = 2mc and g ' hc into (7.56), by using (7.51) and evaluating the last bracket\nof (7.55) for mc = 0.268, a further lower bound for the coupling g in our first order case q = 4:\n\u0012 J \u00132/5\ng − hc\n8\n.\nhc\nNT\n\n(7.57)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n92\n\nThe first registration time, which governs the possibility of decoupling, and the second one, which is the delay\nafter which the pointer variable approaches the equilibrium value, are therefore nearly the same, namely τreg , contrary\nto the case q = 2 of a second order transition (§ 7.2.3).\nThe registration process for q = 4 is illustrated by Figs. 7.4 and 7.6, obtained through numerical integration. The\ntime dependence of μ(t) as well as the widening of the distribution are influenced by the existence of the minimum\nfor the drift velocity. Although in this example g lies above the threshold hc , N is not sufficiently large to fulfil the\ncondition (7.57). The\n√ widening is so large that a significant part of the weight P(m, t) remains for a long time below\nthe bifurcation mc 3 which appears when g is switched off. The bound (7.57) was evaluated by requiring that such a\nswitching off takes place after the average magnetization μ passes 2mc = 0.54. Here however, for N = 1000, T = 0.2J\nand g = 0.045J, the bound is very stringent, since we cannot switch off g before μ has reached (at the time 1.09τreg\nfound from (E.15)) the value 1 − 13 · 10−5 , close to the equilibrium value mF = 1 − 9 · 10−5 .\nAltogether, for q = 2 as well as for q = 4, we can check that the approximate algebraic treatment of §§ 7.2.3 and\n7.2.4 fits the numerical solution of Eq. (7.1) exemplified by the figures 7.3 to 7.6. In both cases, the registration times\n(7.44) and (7.48) for q = 2 or (7.52) for q = 4, which characterize the evolution of the diagonal blocks of the density\nmatrix of the total system D̂, are much longer than the truncation time (5.6) over which the off-diagonal blocks decay.\nTwo reasons conspire to ensure this large ratio: the weakness of the coupling γ between magnet and bath, which\nmakes τreg large; and the large value of N, which makes τtrunc small.\nP\ntΤ reg =\n\n14\n12\n10\n\n0\n\n0.1\n0.2\n\n8\n6\n\n0.4\n\n4\n0.6\n2\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n1.0\n\nm\n\nFigure 7.6: The registration process for quartic interactions (q = 4). The probability density P(m, t) = P↑↑ (m, t)/r↑↑ (0) as function of m is\nrepresented at different times up to t = 1.5 τreg . The parameters are chosen as N = 1000, T = 0.2J and g = 0.045J as in Fig 7.4. The time scale is\nhere the registration time τreg = 38τ J = 38~/γJ, which is large due to the existence of a bottleneck around mc = 0.268. The coupling g exceeds\nthe critical value hc = 0.0357J needed for proper registration, but since (g − hc )/hc is small, the drift velocity has a low positive minimum at 0.270\nnear mc (Fig. 7.2). Around this minimum, reached at the time 21 τreg , the peak shifts slowly and widens much. Then, the motion fastens and the\npeak narrows rapidly, coming close to ferromagnetism around the time τreg , after which equilibrium is exponentially reached.\n\n7.3. Giant fluctuations of the magnetization\nWe have studied in subsection 7.2 the evolution of the probability distribution P(m, t) = P↑↑ (m, t)/r↑↑ (0) of the\nmagnetization of M in case this distribution presents a single peak (7.10) at all times. This occurs when P(m, t) always\nremains entirely located, except for negligible tails, on a single side of the bifurcation −mB of the drift flow v(m). We\nwill now consider the case of an active bifurcation [265, 266, 267, 268, 269]: The initial distribution is split during\nthe evolution into two parts evolving towards +mF and −mF . This situation is relevant to our measurement process for\nq = 2 in regard to two questions: (i) How fast should one perform the cooling of the bath before the initial time, and\nthe switching on of the system-apparatus interaction around the initial time? (ii) What is the percentage of errors of\nregistration if the coupling g is so small that it violates the condition (7.41)?\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n93\n\n7.3.1. Dynamics of the invariance breaking\nBe the change\nthat you want to see in the world\nMohandas Gandhi\nIn order to answer the above two questions, we first determine the Green’s function for the equation of motion\n(7.1) which governs P(m, t) for q = 2 in the Markovian regime. This will allow us to deal with an arbitrary initial\ncondition. The Green’s function G(m, m0 , t − t0 ) is characterized by the equation\n∂\n1 ∂2\n∂\nG(m, m0 , t − t0 ) +\n[v(m)G(m, m0 , t − t0 )] −\n[w(m)G(m, m0 , t − t0 )] = δ(m − m0 )δ(t − t0 ),\n(7.58)\n∂t\n∂m\nN ∂m2\nwith G(m, m0 , t − t0 ) = 0 for t < t0 . We have replaced the initial time 0 by a running time t0 in order to take advantage of\nthe convolution property of G. The functions v(m) and w(m) defined by (7.6) and (7.7) involve a field h which stands\neither for an applied external field if A = M + B evolves alone (a case that could appear but which we do not consider),\nor for ±g if we consider P↑↑ or P↓↓ if A is coupled to S during the measurement. We wish to face the situation in which\nP(m, t) lies, at least after some time, astride the bifurcation point −mB = −h/(J − T ). Such a situation has extensively\nbeen studied [265, 266, 267, 268, 269], and we adapt the existing methods to the present problem which is similar to\nSuzuki’s model.\nWe first note that the initial distribution P(m, t0 = 0) is concentrated near the origin, a property thus satisfied by\nthe variable m0 in G(m, m0 , t). In this region, it is legitimate to simplify v(m0 ) and w(m0 ) into\nγT\nγ\n[h + (J − T )m0 ],\nw(m0 ) ≈\n,\n(7.59)\n~\n~\nwhere we also used h \u001c T . In order to implement this simplification which holds only for m0 \u001c 1, we replace the\nforward equation (7.58) in terms of t which characterizes G(m, m0 , t − t0 ) by the equivalent backward equation, for\n∂G(m, m0 , t − t0 )/∂t0 , in terms of the initial time t0 which runs down from t to 0. This equation is written and solved in\nAppendix F. The distribution P(m, t) is then given by\nZ\nP(m, t) =\ndm0G(m, m0 , t)P(m0 , 0).\n(7.60)\nv(m0 ) ≈\n\nWe derive below several approximations for P(m, t), which are valid in limiting cases. These various results are\nencompassed by the general expression (F.13)–(F.15) for P(m, t), obtained through the less elementary approach of\nAppendix F.\nAs in § 7.2.3, the evolution takes place in three stages [265, 266, 267, 268, 269]: (i) widening of the initial\ndistribution, which here takes place over the bifurcation −mB ; (ii) drift on both sides of −mB towards +mF and −mF ;\n(iii) narrowing around +mF and −mF of the two final peaks, which evolve separately towards equilibrium. We shall\nnot need to consider here the last stage, the approach to quasi-equilibrium, that we studied in § 7.1.4. or (i) (ii) (iii)??\nThe probability distribution P(m, t) is thus expressed in terms of the initial distribution P(m, 0) by (7.60), at all\ntimes,\n√ except during the final equilibration. If P(m, 0) is a narrow Gaussian peak centered at m = μ0 with a width\nδ0 / N, we can use the expression (F.10) of G, which yields\nr\n\n\nN (μ0 − μ0 )2\nN 1\nv(μ0 )\n\n.\nP(m, t) =\nexp  −\n(7.61)\nv(m) 2π δ1 (t)\n2 δ21 (t)\nThe function μ0 (m, t) is defined for arbitrary values of m by\nZ m\ndm00\n,\n(7.62)\nt=\n00\nμ0 (m,t) v(m )\nwhile the variance that enters (7.61) is determined by\nT\nT −2t/τreg\n(1 − e−2t/τreg ) ≡ δ21 −\ne\n,\nJ−T\nJ−T\nWith time, it increases from δ20 /N to δ21 /N.\nδ21 (t) ≡ δ20 +\n\nδ21 ≡\n\nT\nT0\n+\n.\nT0 − J J − T\n\n(7.63)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n94\n\nPM\n12\ntΤ reg =\n\n25\n\n10\n10\n8\n\n0\n6\n\n6\n5\n4\n2\n\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.5\n1\n\n0.0\n\n4\n2\n\n3\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nm\n\nFigure 7.7: Relaxation of an unstable paramagnetic state (q = 2) in the absence of a field (g = 0). The probability distribution PM (m, t) is\nrepresented at several√times. As in Figs. 7.3 and 7.5 the parameters are N = 1000 and T = 0.65J. First the Gaussian paramagnetic peak around\nm = 0 with width 1/ N widens considerably. Around t = τflat = 2.2τreg , the distribution extends over most of the interval −mF , +mF (mF = 0.872)\nand is nearly flat. Then, two peaks progressively build up, moving towards −mF and +mF . Finally each peak tends to the Gaussian ferromagnetic\nequilibrium shape, the curves at t = 10τreg and 25τreg basically coincide.\n\n7.3.2. Spontaneous relaxation of the initial paramagnetic state\nCo se doma uvar̆ı́, to se doma snı́ 68\nCzech proverb\nThe registration process that we studied in § 7.2.3 is the same as the relaxation, for q = 2 and T < J, of the\ninitial paramagnetic state (3.49) towards the positive ferromagnetic state +mF in the presence of a sufficiently large\npositive external field h. We now consider the situation in which A evolves in the absence of a field. The process will\ndescribe the dynamics of the spontaneous symmetry breaking, which leads from the unstable symmetric paramagnetic\ndistribution PM (m, 0) to the ferromagnetic distribution (3.57) for +mF and −mF , occurring with equal probabilities.\nWe present below an approximate analytic solution, and illustrate it by Fig. 7.7 which relies on a numerical solution.\nApart from the final stage, the result is given by (7.61) with μ0 = 0, δ20 = T 0 /(T 0 − J), and v(m) = (γ/~)Jm[1 −\nm coth(Jm/T )]. During the first stage, we have v(m) ∼ m/τreg and hence μ0 ∼ me−t/τreg , so that (7.61) reduces to\nr\n\n\nNm2 e−2t/τreg\nN e−t/τreg\nPM (m, t) =\nexp   −\n(7.64)\n.\n2π δ1 (t)\n2δ21 (t)\nOn the time scale τreg = ~/γ(J − T ), this distribution widens exponentially, with the variance\nT \u0015\nT0\n1 \u0014 2 2t/τreg\nT\n−\nδ1 e\n,\nδ21 ≡\n+\n.\nN\nJ−T\nT0 − J J − T\n\n(7.65)\n\nAs in § 7.2.3, the widening is first induced by the diffusion term, which is then relayed by the gradient of the drift\nvelocity v(m). However, the effect is√much stronger here because the distribution remains centered √\naround m = 0.\nIn fact, at times of order τreg ln N, the width of the peak of PM (m, t) is no longer of order 1/ N, but it is finite\nfor large N. If we define the lifetime τpara of the paramagnetic state as the delay during which this width is less that\n√\nα, say α = 1/10, it equals (for α N \u001d 1)\n√\nτpara = τreg ln α N =\n\n√\n~\nln α N.\nγ(J − T )\n\n(7.66)\n\nThe second stage of the evolution is then reached (Fig. 7.7). An analytic expression of PM (m, t) can then be found\nby using the Mittag-Leffler approximation (E.1) for v(m) (with h = 0).

When they get well separated, PM (m, t) is concentrated in two symmetric regions, below mF and above −mF , and it reaches a scaling regime [265, 266, 267, 268, 269]\nin which (for m > 0)\n#2\n\"\nmF\nμ0 (m, t) ∼ mF e−t/τreg\n(7.72)\n2(mF − m)\n√\nis small, of order 1/ N.

In particular, its tail above mmax is short,\na+1\nk\nwhereas its tail below mmax extends\n√ far as 1/(mmax − m) ; only moments h(mF − m) i with k < a exist.\nAfter a delay of order aτreg ln N, the width of the peaks of PM (m, t) and their distance to ±mF reach an order of\n√\nmagnitude 1/ N. The diffusion term becomes active, and each peak tends to the Gaussian shape (3.57) as in § 7.1.4.\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n96\n\nThis crossover could be expressed explicitly by writing the Green’s function for m and m0 near mF (as we did near 0 in\n§ 7.3.1) and by taking (7.74) as initial condition. All the above features fit the numerical solution shown by Fig. 7.7.\nIn our measurement problem, q = 2, the above evolution begins to take place at the time −τinit at which the\napparatus is initialized (§ 3.3.3). Before t = −τinit , paramagnetic equilibrium has been reached at the temperature\nT 0 > J, and the initial distribution of m is given by (3.49), (3.50) (3.52). The sudden cooling of the bath down to the\ntemperature T < J lets the evolution (7.64) start at the time −τinit . We wish that, at the time t = 0 when the coupling\ng is switched on and the measurement begins, the distribution PM (m, 0) is still narrow, close to (3.49). We thus need\nδ1 (τinit ) to be of the order of δ0 , that is,\nT0 J − T\nJ−T\n2τinit\n=\n.\n< δ20\nτreg\nT\nT0 − J T\n\n(7.76)\n\nThe bath should be cooled down and the system-apparatus interaction ĤSA should be switched on over a delay τinit\nnot larger than the registration time τreg = ~/γ(J − T ).\nThe situation is more favorable in case the initial depolarized state of the spins of M is generated by a radiofrequency field rather than through equilibration with the phonon bath at a high but finite temperature T 0 . In this case,\na sudden cooling of the bath at the time −τinit is not needed. The bath can beforehand be cooled at the required\ntemperature T lower than T c = J. At the time −τinit , the spins are suddenly set by the field into their most disordered\nstate, a process which hardly affects the bath since γ \u001c 1. The above discussion then holds as if T 0 were infinite.\nIf a weak field h0 is accidentally present during the preparation by thermalization of the initial paramagnetic state,\nit should not produce a bias in the measurement. This field shifts the initial expectation value hmi of m from 0 to\nμ0 = h0 /(T 0 − J), which enters (7.61). At the time 0, hmi has become μ0 exp(τinit /τreg ), so that the residual field h0 is\nineffective provided μ0 < δ0 , that is for\nr\nT 0 (T 0 − J)\nh0 <\n.\n(7.77)\nN\nThe success of the measurement process thus requires the conditions (7.76) and (7.77) on the parameters τinit , T 0 , h0\nthat characterize the preparation of the initial state of the apparatus.\nFor a quartic interaction (q = 4), the initial paramagnetic state is metastable rather than unstable. Its spontaneous\ndecay in the absence of a field requires m to cross the potential barrier of the free energy which ensures metastability,\nas shown by Fig. 3.3. At temperatures T below the transition point but not too low, the dynamics is governed by an\nactivation process, with a characteristic duration of order (~/γJ) exp(∆F/T ), where ∆F is the height of the barrier, for\ninstance ∆F = 0.054NT for T = 0.2J. The lifetime of the paramagnetic state is thus exponentially larger than the\nregistration time for large N, so that there is no hurry in performing the measurement after preparation of the initial\nstate.\nThe above derivation holds for a large statistical ensemble E of systems in both classical and quantum statistical\nmechanics. In the former case, the doubly peaked probability P(m) reached at the final time can be interpreted in\nterms of the individual systems of E: the magnetization of half of these systems is expected to reach mF , the other\nhalf −mF . However, this seemingly natural assertion requires a proof in quantum physics, due to the ambiguity of the\ndecomposition of the ensemble E into subensembles (§ 10.2.3). Such a proof is displayed in the last part of § 11.2.4;\nit relies on a relaxation process generated by specific interactions within the magnetic dot.\n7.3.3. Probability of wrong registrations for second order phase transitions of the magnet\nJe suis malade,\ncomplètement malade69\nWritten by Serge Lama, sung by Dalida\nWe have seen (§ 7.2.3) how the magnet M, under the conjugate effect of B and S, reaches quasi certainly the\nfinal magnetization +mF in the sector ↑↑ where sz = +1, provided g is not too small. We expect that if the condition\n69 I am sick, completely sick\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n97\n\n(7.41) on g is violated, the apparatus will indicate, with some probability P− , the wrong magnetization −mF , although\nsz = +1. The evolution of P↑↑ (m, t) in such a situation is illustrated by Fig. 7.8. A similar failure may occur if the\naverage magnetization μ0 in the initial state is not 0 but takes a negative value due to a biased preparation.\nP\n10\n\n20\n\n6\n15\ntΤ reg =\n10\n\n0\n4\n\n5\n10 6\n-1.0\n\n0.25\n1\n\n3\n1.5\n\n2\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n1.0\n\nm\n\nFigure 7.8: Wrong registration for quadratic interactions (q = 2). The probability distribution P(m, t) is represented at different times for the\nsame parameters N = 1000 and T = 0.65 as in Fig. 7.5, but the coupling g = 0.03J is now sufficiently weak so that the apparatus registers the\nmagnetization −mF with a significant probability P− , although the system has a spin sz = +1. Like in Fig. 7.7, the probability distribution flattens\nbefore the two ferromagnetic peaks emerge (with weights P+ and P− ).\n\nThe probability P− of a wrong registration −mF for sz = +1 arises from values m < mB < 0 and reads\nZ mB\nZ mB\nP↑↑ (m, t)\nP− =\ndm\n≡\ndm P (m, t) ,\nr↑↑ (0)\n−1\n−1\n\n(7.78)\n\nwhere the time t is in principle such that P↑↑ (m, t) has reached its equilibrium shape, with two peaks around +mF\nand −mF . In fact, we do not need the final equilibrium to have been reached since (7.78) remains constant after P↑↑\nhas split into two separate parts. And even the latter condition is not necessary: After the time τreg the diffusion term\nbecomes inactive and the evolution of P↑↑ (m, t) is governed by the pure drift Green’s function (F.7); then there is no\nlonger any transfer of weight across the bifurcation −mB = −g/(J − T ). We can therefore evaluate (7.78) at the rather\nearly stage when the distribution has not yet spread out beyond the small m region where (7.59) holds, provided we\ntake t \u001d τreg .\nWe thus use the expression (7.61) of P↑↑ (m, t) valid during the first stage of the process, which reads\nr\n\n\ni2\n\nN 1\nN h\n\n\n−t/τreg\n−t/τreg\n− mB − μ 0\n(7.79)\nP(m, t) = e\nexp\n− 2δ2 (t) (m + mB )e\n.\n2π δ1 (t)\n1\nBy taking (m + mB )e−t/τreg as variable we check that the integral (7.78) depends on time only through the exponential\nin (7.63), so that it remains constant as soon as t \u001d τreg , when the second stage of the evolution is reached. We\neventually find:\nr\nN 1\n1\nλ≡\n(mB + μ0 ),\n(7.80)\nP− = erfc λ,\n2\n2 δ1\nwhere the error function, defined by\nZ ∞\n2\n2\nerfc λ = √\ndξe−ξ ,\n(7.81)\nπ λ\nbehaves for λ \u001d 1 as\n\n1\n2\nerfc λ ∼ √ e−λ .\nπλ\n\n(7.82)\n\nThe diffusion which takes place during the first stage of the evolution has changed in (7.80) the initial width δ0 into\nδ1 , given by (7.40).\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n98\n\n√\n\nFor μ0 = 0, the probability of error becomes sizeable when Ng/J is not sufficiently large. For example, for T =\n0.65J and g = 0.03J, we find numerically P− = 21%, 13%, 5.4%, 1.15% and 0.065% for N = 250, 500, 1000, 2000\nand 4000, respectively. These data are reasonably fitted by the approximation P− (N) = 1.2 N −1/4 exp(−0.0014N) for\n(7.80). The result for N = 1000 is illustrated by the weight of the peak near −mF in Fig. 7.8. False registrations were\nalso present with the data of Fig. 7.5 (N = 1000, T = 0.65J, g = 0.05J), with a probability P− = 0.36%, but the effect\nis too small to be visible on the scale of the figure.\nThe occurrence of a negative μ0 increases P− , an effect which, with the above data, becomes sizeable for |μ0 | ∼\n0.05. For P↓↓ the percentage of errors is given by (7.80) with μ0 changed into −μ0 in λ.\nWe write for completeness in Appendix F the evolution of the shape of P(m, t). This is not crucial for the measurement problem (for which P↑↑ (m, t) = r↑↑ (0) P (m, t)), but it is relevant for the dynamics of the phase transition, depending on the initial conditions and on the presence of a parasite field. Here again, Suzuki’s regime\n[265, 266, 267, 268, 269], where the distribution is no longer peaked, is reached for t \u001d τreg . Now P(m, t) is\nasymmetric, but it still has a quasi linear behavior in a wide range around m = 0 when τ ' τflat (see Eqs. (7.69),\n(7.70)).\n7.3.4. Possible failure of registration for first order transitions\nQuem não tem cão,\ncaça como gato 70\nPortuguese proverb\nThe situation is quite different for first-order transitions (q = 4) as regards the possibility of wrong registrations.\nNote first that F(m) has a high maximum for negative m between 0 and m⇓ < 0 (Figs. 3.3 and 3.4), which constitutes a\npractically impassable barrier that diffusion is not sufficient to overcome. Accordingly, the zero of v(m) at m = −mB '\n−2mc is a repulsive fixed point (Fig.7.2 and § 7.2.4), which prevents the distribution from developing a tail below it.\nWe shall therefore never find any registration with negative ferromagnetic magnetization in the sector sz = +1.\nP\nt  ΤJ =\n\n14\n\n0, 0.1 0.2 0.4 1, 2, 10\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n\n-0.10\n\n-0.05\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\nm\n\nFigure 7.9: Failure of measurement for quartic interactions (q = 4). The probability distribution P(m, t) is represented at times up to 10 τ J , where\nτ J = ~/γJ. The parameters are N = 1000 and T = 0.2 as in Figs. 7.4 and 7.6, but here g = 0.01J lies below the threshold hc . The peak evolves\ntowards metastable paramagnetic equilibrium in the presence of the field g, but g is too small to allow crossing the barrier and reaching the more\nstable ferromagnetic equilibrium around mF ' 1. Switching off the coupling g brings back the distribution to its original place around 0, so that no\nproper registration is achieved.\n\nNevertheless, we have seen (§ 7.2.2) that registration is possible only if the coupling g exceeds hc . For g < hc ,\nthe peak of P(m) initially at m = 0 moves upwards in the sector ↑↑ associated with sz = +1 (Fig. 7.9), and ends\nup by stabilizing at the first attractive point encountered, at m = mP (Fig. 7.2). Symmetrically, the distribution of\nP↓↓ (m) ends up at −mP . However this difference between the two values of sz cannot be regarded as a registration\n70 Who has no dog, hunts as a cat\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n99\n\nsince switching off the coupling g between S and A brings back both distributions P↑↑ and P↓↓ to the initial Gaussian\nshape around m = 0. The apparatus A then always relaxes back to the locally stable paramagnetic state.\nFinally, if the coupling g, although larger than the threshold hc , is close to it, the registration takes place correctly\n√\nprovided this coupling remains active until the distribution P↑↑ (m) has completely passed the bifurcation mc 3 occurring for g = 0 (Eq. (7.56)). The lower bound toff of the time when g can thus be safely switched off is close to τreg\n(which is also close to the time needed to reach ferromagnetic equilibrium).\nIn case S and A are√decoupled too early, so that the condition (7.56) is violated, the tail of P↑↑ (m, t) lying below\nthe bifurcation m = mc 3 is pushed back towards the paramagnetic region m ≈ 0. If the decoupling g → 0 is made\nsuddenly at the time toff , the probability P0 of such events can be evaluated as in § 7.3.3 in terms of the error function\nby integration of P↑↑ (m, toff ) from m = −1 up to mc . It represents the probability of aborted measurement processes,\nfor which the apparatus returns to its neutral paramagnetic state without giving any indication, while S is left in the\nstate | ↑i. In a set of repeated measurements, a proportion P0 of runs are not registered at all, the other ones being\nregistered correctly.\n7.3.5. Erasure of the pointer indication\nDe dag van morgen deelt met zijn eigen zorgen71\nDutch proverb\nAs shown in §§ 7.2.3 and 7.2.4, the registration is achieved at a time tf sufficiently larger than the delay τreg after\nwhich S and M have been decoupled. The state D̂(tf ) of S + A is then given by the expected expression (1.7). Within\nthe considered approximations, the distributions P↑↑ (m, t) and P↓↓ (m, t) no longer evolve for t > tf , and remain fully\nconcentrated near mF and −mF , respectively, so that the results can be read out or processed at any observation time\ntobs > tf . However, the breaking of invariance, on which we rely to assert that the two ferromagnetic states of the\npointer are stationary, is rigorous only in the large N limit. Strictly speaking, for finite N, the states R̂M⇑ and R̂M⇓\nreached by M at this stage in each sector are not in equilibrium (though they may have a long lifetime). Indeed,\nin the Markovian regime, we have shown in § 7.1.3 that the evolution of M under the influence of the thermal bath\ncannot stop until PM (m, t) becomes proportional to G(m) exp[−βE(m)], with E(m) = −JNq−1 mq . Otherwise, the timederivative (7.21) of the free energy F(m) of the state R̂M (t) cannot vanish. The limit reached by R̂↑↑ (t)/r↑↑ (0) (and of\nR̂↓↓ (t)/r↓↓ (0)) is then 21 (R̂M⇑ + R̂M⇓ ). Hence, when the latter true equilibrium state for finite N is attained, the indication\nof the pointer is completely random. We have lost all information about the initial state of S, and the spin S has been\ncompletely depolarized whatever its initial state: the result of the measurement has been washed out. We denote as\nτeras the characteristic time which governs this erasure of the indication of the pointer.\nIt is therefore essential to read or process the registered data before such a loss of memory begins to occur72 . The\nobservation must take place at a time tobs much shorter than the erasure time:\nτreg < tf < tobs \u001c τeras .\n\n(7.83)\n\nThe dynamics of the erasure, a process leading M from R̂M⇑ or R̂M⇓ to the state 12 (R̂M⇑ + R̂M⇓ ) of complete\nequilibrium, is governed by the Eq. (4.16) for PM (m, t) (with K̃t (ω) replaced by K̃(ω) and g = 0), which retains the\nquantum character of the apparatus. We will rely on this equation in subsection 8.1 where studying the Curie–Weiss\nmodel in the extreme case of N = 2. For the larger values of N and the temperatures considered here, we can use its\ncontinuous semi-classical limit (7.1), to be solved for an initial condition expressed by (3.55) with mi = mF or −mF .\nHere we have to deal with the progressive, very slow leakage of the distribution PM (m, t) from one of the ferromagnetic\nstates to the other through the free energy barrier that separates them. This mechanism, disregarded in §§ 7.2.3, 7.2.4,\n7.3.3 and 7.3.4, is controlled by the weak tail of the distribution PM (m, t) which extends into the regions of m where\nF(m) is largest. The drift term of (7.1) alone would repel the distribution P↑↑ (m, t) and keep it concentrated near mF .\nAn essential role is now played by the diffusion term, which tends to flatten this distribution over the whole range of\nm, and thus allows the leak towards −mF . Rather than solving this equation, it will be sufficient for our purpose to\n71 The day of tomorrow addresses its own worries\n72 Photographs on film or paper fade out after some time\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n100\n\nrely on a semi-phenomenological argument: Under the considered conditions, the full equilibration is an activation\nprocess governed by the height of the free energy barrier. Denoting as ∆F the difference between the maximum of\nF(m) and its minimum, Fferro , we thus estimate the time scale of erasure as:\nτeras ∼\n\n∆F\n~\nexp\n,\nγJ\nT\n\n(7.84)\n\nwhich is large as an exponential of N. In order to use the process as a measurement, we need this time to be much\nlarger than the registration time so that we are able to satisfy (7.83), which yields\nJ\n∆F\nexp\n,\nJ−T\nT\n\n(q = 2);\n\nJ\nT\n\ns\n\nmc T\n∆F\nexp\n,\ng − hc\nT\n\n(q = 4).\n\n(7.85)\n\nFrom (3.55) (taken for h = 0), we find the numerical value of ∆F/T for the examples of figs. 7.5 and 7.6, namely\n0.130N for q = 2, T = 0.065J, and 0.607N for q = 4, T = 0.2J (see fig. 3.3). The condition (7.85) sets again a lower\nbound on N to allow successful measurements, N \u001d 25 for the example with quadratic interactions, N \u001d 7 for the\nexample with quartic interactions. Such a condition is violated for a non-macroscopic apparatus, in particular in the\nmodel with N = 2 treated below in subsection 8.1 which will require special care to ensure registration.\n7.3.6. “Buridan’s ass”effect: hesitation\nDo not hesitate,\nor you will be left in between doing something,\nhaving something and being nothing\nEthiopian proverb\nIn the case of a second-order transition (q = 2), the subsections 7.2 and 7.3, illustrated by Figs. 7.5, 7.7 and 7.8,\nshow off the occurrence, for the evolution of the probability distribution P(m, t), of two contrasted regimes, depending\nwhether the bifurcation −mB is active or not. The mathematical problem is the same as for many problems of statistical\nmechanics involving dynamics of instabilities, such as directed Brownian motion near an unstable fixed point, and it\nhas been extensively studied [265, 266, 267, 268, 269]. The most remarkable feature is the behavior exemplified by\nFig. 7.7: For a long duration, the random magnetization m hesitates so much between the two stable values +mF and\n−mF that a wide range of values of m in the interval −mF , +mF have nearly equal probabilities. We have proposed to\nterm this anomalous situation Buridan’s ass effect [247], referring to the celebrated argument attributed to Buridan,\na dialectician of the first half of the XIVth century: An ass placed just half way between two identical bales of hay\nwould theoretically stay there indefinitely and starve to death, because the absence of causal reason to choose one bale\nor the other would let it hesitate for ever, at least according to Buridan73 .\nIn fact, major qualitative differences distinguish the situation in which the final state +mF is reached with probability P+ = 1 (subsection 7.2) from the situation in which significant probabilities P+ and P− to reach either +mF or −mF\nexist (subsection\n7.3). In the first case, the peak of P(m, t) moves simply from 0 to +mF ; the fluctuation of m remains\n√\nof order 1/ N at all times, even when it is largest, at the time when the average drift velocity v(μ) is maximum (Eq.\n(7.45)). In the second case, the exponential rise of the fluctuations of m leads, during a long period, to a broad and flat\ndistribution P(m, t), with a shape independent of N.\nIn both cases, we encountered (for q = 2) the same time scale τreg = ~/γ(J − T ), which characterizes the first\nstage of the motion described by either (7.43), (7.39) or (7.79). However, in the first case, P+ ' 1, the duration\n(7.48) of the whole process is just the product of τreg by a factor independent of N, of order 2 ln[mF (J − T )/g], as also\nshown by (E.6), whereas in the second case, P+ < 1, the dynamics becomes infinitely slow\n√ in the large N limit. The\ncharacteristic time τflat at which the distribution is flat, given by (7.69), is of order τreg ln[ NmF (J − T )/J]. Suzuki’s\nscaling regime [265, 266, 267, 268, 269] is attained over times of order τflat . Then P(m, t) does not depend on N for\n73 The effect was never observed, though, at the farm where the last author of the present work grew up\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n101\n\n√\n\nN → ∞, but the duration√of the relaxation process is large as ln N. It is this long delay which allows the initial\ndistribution, narrow as 1/ N, to broaden enormously instead of being shifted towards one side.\nBuridan’s argument has been regarded as a forerunner of the idea of probability. The infinite time during which\nthe ass remains at m = 0 is recovered here for N → ∞. An infinite duration of the process is also found in the absence\nof diffusion in the limit of a narrow initial distribution (δ0 → 0). The flatness of P(m, t) at times of order τflat means\nthat at such times we cannot predict at all where the ass will be on the interval −mF , +mF , an idea that Buridan could\nnot emit before the elaboration of the concept of probability. The counterpart of the field h, for Buridan’s ass, would\nbe a strong wind which pushes it; the counterpart of μ0 would be a different distance from the two bales of hay; in\nboth of these cases, the behavior of the ass becomes predictable within small fluctuations.\nSince the slowing factor which distinguishes the time scales in the two regimes is logarithmic, very large values\nof N are required to exhibit a large\n√ ratio for the relaxation times. In Figs. 7.5, 7.7 and 7.8 we have taken N = 1000 so\nas to make the fluctuations in 1/ N visible. As a consequence, the duration of the registration is hardly larger in Fig.\n7.7 (q = 2, bias) than in Fig. 7.5 (q = 2, no bias).\nExcept during the final equilibration, the magnet keeps during its evolution some memory of its initial state\nthrough δ1 (Eq. (7.40)). If the bifurcation is inactive (§ 7.2.3), this quantity occurs through the variance (7.45) of\nthe distribution. If it is active (§ 7.3.2), it occurs through the time scale τflat , but not through the shape of P(m, t).\nOur model of the ferromagnet is well-known for being exactly solvable at equilibrium in the large N limit by\nmeans of a static mean-field approach. In the single peak regime, the dynamics expressed by (7.30) is also the same as\nthe outcome of a time-dependent mean-field approach. However, in the regime leading to two peaks at +mF and −mF ,\nno mean-field approximation can describe the dynamics even for large N, due to the giant fluctuations.\nThe intuitive\n√\nidea that the variable m, because it is macroscopic, should display fluctuations small as 1/ N is then wrong, except\nnear the initial time or for each peak of P(m, t) near the final equilibrium.\nThe giant fluctuations of m which occur in Buridan’s ass regime may be regarded as a dynamic counterpart of\nthe fluctuations that occur at equilibrium at the critical point T = J [250, 251]. In both cases, the order parameter,\nalthough macroscopic, presents large fluctuations in the large N limit, so that its treatment requires statistical mechanics. Although no temperature can be associated with M during the relaxation process, the transition from T 0 > J to\nT < J involves intermediate states which behave as in the critical region. The well-known critical fluctuations and\ncritical slowing down manifest themselves here by the large uncertainty on m displayed during a long delay by P(m, t).\nSuzuki’s slowing down and flattening [265, 266, 267, 268, 269] take place not only in the symmetric case (§ 7.3.2),\nbut also in the asymmetric case (§ 7.3.3), provided P− is sizeable. Thus the occurrence of Buridan’s ass effect\nis governed by the non vanishing of the probabilities P+ and P− of +mF and −mF in the final state. Everything\ntakes place as if the behavior were governed by final causes: The process is deterministic if the target is unique; it\ndisplays large uncertainties and is slow if hesitation may lead to one target or to the other. These features reflect in a\nprobabilistic language, first, the slowness of the pure drift motion near the bifurcation which implies a long random\ndelay to set m into motion, and, second, the importance of the diffusion term there.\n8. Imperfect measurements, failures and multiple measurements\nNiet al wat blinkt is goud 74\nTout ce qui brille n’est pas or 74\nDutch and french proverbs\nIn sections 5 to 7, we have solved our model under conditions on the various parameters which ensure that the\nmeasurement is ideal. We will resume these conditions in section 9.4. We explore beforehand some situations in\nwhich they may be violated, so as to set forth how each violation prevents the dynamical process from being usable as\na quantum measurement. We have already seen that, in case the spin-apparatus interaction presents no randomness,\nthe magnet-bath interaction should not be too small; otherwise, recurrence would occur in the off-diagonal blocks\nof the density operator, and would thus prevent their truncation (§ 5.1). We have also shown how a spin-apparatus\ncoupling that is too weak may prevent the registration to take place for q = 4 (§ 7.2.2 and § 7.2.4), or may lead to\n74 All that glitters is not gold\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n102\n\nwrong results for q = 2 (§ 7.3.3). We study below what happens if the number of degrees of freedom of the pointer\nis small, by letting N = 2 (subsection 8.1); see [164, 166] for model studies along this line. We then examine the\nimportance of the commutation [4, 13, 76, 270, 271, 272] of the measured observable with the Hamiltonian of the\nsystem (subsection 8.2). Finally we exhibit a process which might allow imperfect simultaneous measurements of\nnon-commuting observables (subsection 8.3) [273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278].\nThe solution of these extensions of the Curie–Weiss model involves many technicalities that we could not skip.\nThe reader interested only in the results will find them in subsection 9.5.\n8.1. Microscopic pointer\nCe que je sais le mieux,\nc’est mon commencement75\nJean Racine, Les Plaideurs\nIn the above sections, we have relied on the large number N of degrees of freedom of the magnet M. As the statistical fluctuations of the magnetization m are then weak, the magnet can behave as a macroscopic pointer with classical\nfeatures. Moreover\nthe truncation time τtrunc is the shortest among all the characteristic times (section 5) because it\n√\nbehaves as 1/ N. The large value of N was also used (section 7) to describe the registration process by means of a\npartial differential equation. It is natural to wonder whether a small value of N can preserve the characteristic properties of a quantum measurement. Actually the irreversibility of any measurement process (subsection 6.2) requires the\napparatus to be large. In subsection 6.1, we showed that the irreversibility of the truncation can be ensured by a large\nvalue of N and a randomness in the couplings gn , n = 1, · · · , N (subsection 6.2); but this irreversibility, as well as that\nof the registration (section 7), can also be caused by the large size of the bath. For small N, the irreversibility of both\nthe truncation and the registration should be ensured by the bath. We now study the extreme situation in which N = 2.\n8.1.1. Need for a low temperature\nFor N = 2 the magnetization m̂ has the eigenvalue m = 0 with multiplicity 2, regarded as “paramagnetic”, and two\nnon-degenerate eigenvalues m = +1 and m = −1 regarded as “ferromagnetic”. Since m̂4 = m̂2 , we may set J4 = 0 and\ndenote J2 = J. The corresponding eigenenergies of Ĥ M are 0 and −J, and those of the Hamiltonian Ĥi of Eq.

(We recall that PM = P↑↑ +P↓↓ .) The initial conditions are thus Pi j (m, 0) = ri j (0)δm,0 .\nIn order to identify the process with an ideal measurement, we need at least to find at sufficiently large times\n(i) the truncation, expressed by P↑↓ (m, t) → 0, and (ii) the system-pointer correlations expressed by P↑↑ (m, t) →\n75 What I know the best I shall begin with\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n103\n\nr↑↑ (0)δm,1 and P↓↓ (m, t) → r↓↓ (0)δm,−1 . This requires, for the magnet in contact with the bath, a long lifetime for\nthe “ferromagnetic” states m = +1 and m = −1. However, the breaking of invariance, which for large N allows\nthe ferromagnetic state where m is concentrated near +mF to be stable, cannot occur here: Nothing hinders here the\ncoupling with the bath to induce transitions from m = +1 to m = −1 through m = 0, so that for large times P(+1, t)\nand P(−1, t), where P(m, t) ≡ P↑↑ (m, t)/r↑↑ (0), tend to a common value close to 21 for T \u001c J.\nThis is made obvious by the expression of (7.21) of the H-theorem. The dissipation in the Markovian regime\n[197, 121, 122] reads here\ndF(t)\ndt\n\n=\n\n−\n\ni P(0, t)eβ~ω+\nγ ω+ e−|ω+ |/Γ h\nβ~ω+\nP(0,\nt)e\n−\n2P(1,\nt)\nln\n+ [ω+ 7→ ω− ,\n2β eβ~ω+ − 1\n2P(1, t)\n\nP(1, t) 7→ P(−1, t)] , (8.6)\n\nand the free energy decreases until the equilibrium 2PM (±1) = PM (0) exp β~ω± is reached. The only possibility\nto preserve a long lifetime for the state m = +1 is to have a low transition rate from m = +1 to m = 0, that is,\naccording to (8.2), a small K̃t (ω+ ). This quantity is dominated in the Markovian regime by a factor exp(−β~ω+ ).\nHence, unless T \u001c J, the apparatus cannot keep the result of the measurement registered during a significant time,\nafter the interaction with S has been switched off. If this condition is satisfied, we may expect to reach for some lapse\nof time a state where P(1, t) = P↑↑ (1, t)/r↑↑ (0) remains close to 1 while P(0, t) is small as P(−1, t).\nMoreover, a faithful registration requires that the coupling g with S is sufficiently large so that the final state, in\nthe evolution of P↑↑ (m, t), has a very small probability to yield m = −1. Since in the Markovian regime the transition\nprobabilities in (8.2) and (8.3) depend on g through ω± = J ± 2g in K̃(ω± ) and K̃(−ω± ) [197, 121, 122], and since this\ndependence arises mainly from exp β~ω± , we must have exp 4βg \u001d 1. The coupling g should moreover not modify\nmuch the spectrum, so that we are led to impose the conditions\nT \u001c 4g \u001c J.\n\n(8.7)\n\n8.1.2. Relaxation of the apparatus alone\nLaat hem maar met rust76\nDutch expression\nAs we did in § 7.3.2 for large N, we focus here on the evolution of the probabilities P(m, t) ≡ P↑↑ (m, t)/r↑↑ (0) for\nthe apparatus alone. It is governed by equations (8.2) and (8.3) in which ω+ = ω− = J/~. For a weak coupling γ we\nexpect that the Markovian regime, where K̃t (ω) = K̃(ω) will be reached before the probabilities have deviated much\nfrom their initial value.

In a measurement, the interaction g between S and\nA must thus be switched on rapidly after the preparation (§ 3.3.3), in a delay τinit \u001c τ so that P(0) is still close to 1\nwhen the measurement process begins.\nWe now evaluate the delay τobs during which the pointer keeps its value and can be observed, after the measurement is achieved and after the coupling with S is switched off.

However, during the time lapse τ \u001c t \u001c τ exp(J/T ), P(1, t) retains a value 1 − 12 exp(−J/T ) close to 1,\nso that the probability of a false registration is then weak.

Registration\nWe now study the time-dependence of the registration process, and determine the probability to reach a false\nresult, that is, to find m = −1 in the sector ↑↑. In the Markovian regime and under the conditions (8.7), the equations\nof motion (8.2), (8.3) for the probabilities P(m, t) = P↑↑ (m, t)/r↑↑ (0) read\ndP(0, t)\ndt\ndP(±1, t)\nτ\ndt\nτ\n\n= e−(J+2g)/T P(1, t) + e−(J−2g)/T P(−1, t) − P(0, t),\n=\n\n1\nP(0, t) − e−(J±2g)/T P(±1, t).\n2\n\n(8.16)\n(8.17)\n\nWe have disregarded in each term contributions of relative order exp(−J/T ) and 2g/J.

At the end of this stage, at times\nτ \u001c t \u001c τreg we reach a nearly stationary situation in which P(0, t) is small as 2 exp(−J/T ), while P(1, t) and P(−1, t)\nare close to 12 . Unexpectedly, in spite of the presence of the coupling g which is large compared to T , the magnet\nM remains for a long time in a state close to the equilibrium state which would be associated to g = 0, without any\ninvariance breaking. This behavior arises from the large value of the transition probabilities from m = 0 to m = ±1,\nwhich are proportional to K̃(−ω± ). For J ± 2g \u001d T , the latter quantity reduces to ~(J ± 2g)/4, which is not sensitive\nto g for 2g \u001c J.\nIn contrast to the situation for large N, the magnet thus begins to lose memory of its initial state. For N \u001d 1, it\nwas the coupling g which triggered the evolution of M, inducing the motion of the peak of P↑↑ (m, t), initially at m = 0,\ntowards larger and larger values of m. Only an initial state involving values m < −mB led to false results at the end of\nthe process. Here, rather surprisingly, the two possible results m = +1 and m = −1 come out nearly symmetrically\nafter the first stage of the process, for τ \u001c t \u001c τreg . In fact we do not even need the initial state to be “paramagnetic”.\nOn this time scale, any initial state for which P(1, 0) = P(−1, 0) leads to P(1, t) = P(−1, t) ' 21 . (An arbitrary initial\ncondition would lead to P(±1, t) = P(±1, 0) + 21 P(0, 0).)\nFortunately, when t approaches τreg the effect of g is felt. For t \u001d τreg the probabilities P(m, t) reach the values\n1\ne−4g/T\n,\nP(−1, t) =\n,\nP(0, t) = 2e−J/T ,\n(8.27)\n−4g/T\n1+e\n1 + e−4g/T\nwhich correspond to the thermal equilibrium of M in the field g. Thus, the probability of a false measurement is here\nP(1, t) =\n\nP− = e−4g/T ,\n\n(8.28)\n\nand it is small if the conditions (8.7) are satisfied. On the other hand, the registration time is τreg , and the registration\ncan be achieved only if the interaction ĤSA remains switched on during a delay larger than τreg . After this delay, if we\nswitch off the coupling g, the result remains registered for a time which allows observation, since τobs , determined in\n§ 8.1.2, is much larger than τtrunc .\nThus, not only the first stage of the registration process is odd, but also the second one. The mechanism at play\nin section 7 was a dynamical breaking of invariance whereas here we have to rely on the establishment of thermal\nequilibrium in the presence of g. The coupling should be kept active for a long time until the values (8.27) are reached,\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n106\n\nwhereas for N \u001d 1, only the beginning of the evolution of P↑↑ (m, t) required the presence of the coupling g; afterwards\nP↑↑ reached the ferromagnetic peak at m = mF , and remained there stably.\nFor N = 2 the possibility of registration on the time scale τreg relies on the form of the transition probabilities\nfrom m = ±1 to m = 0, which are proportional to K̃(ω± ). Although small as exp(−β~ω± )K̃(−ω± ), these transition\nprobabilities contain a factor exp(−β~ω± ) ∝ exp(∓2g/T ) which, since 2g \u001d T , strongly distinguishes +1 from −1,\nwhereas K̃(−ω+ ) ' K̃(−ω− ). Hence the transition rate from m = −1 to m = 0, behaving as exp[−(J − 2g)/T ], allows\nP(0) to slowly increase at the expense of P(−1), then to rapidly decay symmetrically. Since the transition rate from\nm = +1 to m = 0, behaving as exp[−(J + 2g)/T ], is much weaker, the resulting increase of P(1) remains gained.\nAltogether P(1, t) rises in two steps, from 0 to 21 on the time scale τ, then from 12 to nearly 1 on the time scale τreg , as\nshown by (8.25). Meanwhile, P(−1, t) rises from 0 to 21 , then decreases back to 0, ensuring a correct registration only\nat the end of the process, while P(0, t) remains nearly 0 between τ and τreg .\n8.1.4. Truncation\nLes optimistes écrivent mal77\nPaul Valéry, Mauvaises pensées et autres\nIt remains to study the evolution of the off-diagonal blocks of the density operator D̂, which are characterized\nby the three functions of time P↑↓ (m, t). Their equations of motion (8.4), (8.5) involve oscillations in P↑↓ (±1, t) with\nfrequency 2g/π~ generated by the coupling g with S and by a relaxation process generated by the bath. Since the\noscillations are not necessarily rapid, and since γ is small, the damping effect of the bath is expected to occur over\ntimes large compared to ~/T , so that we can again work in the Markovian regime. Moreover, since g \u001c J, we are led\nto replace ω+ and ω− in K̃t> and K̃t< by J~. Hence, we can replace, for instance, K̃t> (ω+ ) + K̃t< (ω− ) by K̃(J/~).\nThe equations of motion for the set P↑↓ (m, t) are thus simplified into\ndP↑↓ (0, t)\ndt\ndP↑↓ (±1, t)\nτ\ndt\nτ\n\n=\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nε P↑↓ (1, t) + P↑↓ (−1, t) − P↑↓ (0, t),\n\n(8.29)\n\n=\n\n1\n±iλP↑↓ (±1, t) + P↑↓ (0, t) − εP↑↓ (±1, t),\n2\n\n(8.30)\n\n4g\n,\nγJ\n\n(8.31)\n\nwhere ε and λ are defined by\nε = e−J/T ,\n\nλ=\n\nwith γ \u001c 1, g \u001c T \u001c J.

However, here again, the other two quantities |P↑↓ (±1, t)| increase in the meanwhile and\nthe truncation of the state is far from being achieved after the time τ.

The quantities P↑↓ (m, t) remain for\na long time proportional to r↑↓ (0), with a coefficient of order 1 for P↑↓ (±1, t), of order ε for P↑↓ (0, t). Truncation is\nthus here a much slower process than registration: equilibrium is reached much faster for the diagonal elements (8.27)\nthan for the off-diagonal ones which are long to disappear. Let us stress that for the present case of a small apparatus,\nthey disappear due to the bath (“environment-induced decoherence” [32, 33, 40, 199, 200, 201, 202]) rather than, as\nin our previous discussion of a large apparatus, due to fast dephasing caused by the large size of M.\nFor 2λ > ε, we are in an oscillatory situation, where the eigenvalues\nr\nε 1 + 2λ2\nε2\nελ2\n2−\nz1,2 =\n±\ni\nλ\n−\n(8.40)\n2 1 + λ2\n4\n1 + λ2\nare complex conjugate.

The truncation time (8.42) practically does not depend on g (within a factor\n2 when 2λ varies from ε to ∞), in contrast to both the truncation time of section 5 and the irreversibility time of\nsection 6. The present truncation time is comparable to the lifetime τobs of an initial pure state m = +1 when it\nspontaneously decays towards m = ±1 with equal probabilities (§ 8.1.2). Hence in both cases the truncation takes\nplace over the delay during which the result of the measurement can be observed.\nFor λ \u001d ε and t \u001d τ, the off-diagonal contributions (8.41) to D̂ are governed by\n\nP↑↓ (±1, t) ∼\n\nr↑↓ (0) −t/τred ±iλt/τ\ne\n.\n2(1 ± iλ)\n\n(8.44)\n\nThe effects on M of S and B are well separated: the oscillations are the same as for γ = 0, while the decay, with\ncharacteristic time τ/ε = (~/γJ) exp(J/T ), is a pure effect of the bath. The amplitude becomes small for λ \u001d 1, that\nis, g \u001d γJ.\n8.1.5. Is this process with bath-induced decoherence a measurement?\nКаждая ворона своего вороненка хвалит.\n\n78\n\nRussian proverb\nWhen the number N of degrees of freedom of the pointer is small as here, the present model appears as a specific\nexample among the general class of models considered by Spehner and Haake [182, 183]. As shown by these\nauthors, the truncation is then governed by the large number of degrees of freedom of the bath, not of the pointer;\nthe truncation is then not faster than the registration. Our detailed study allows us to compare the mechanisms of two\ntypes of processes, for large N and for small N.\nWe have seen (§ 8.1.3) that for N = 2 as for N \u001d 1 both couplings g and γ between S , M and B establish\nthe diagonal correlations between ŝz and m̂ needed to establish Born’s rule. This result is embedded in the values\nreached by P↑↑ and P↓↓ after the time τreg = (2~/γJ) exp[(J − 2g)/T ], much longer than the lifetime τ = ~/γJ of\nthe initial state in the absence of a field or a coupling. Although this property is one important feature of a quantum\nmeasurement, its mechanism is here only a relaxation towards thermal equilibrium. The registration is fragile and\ndoes not survive beyond a delay τobs = (~/γJ) exp(J/T ) once the coupling with S is switched off. For larger N, the\nexistence of a spontaneously broken invariance ensured the long lifetime of the ferromagnetic states, and hence the\nrobust registration of the measurement.\nAnother feature of a quantum measurement, the truncation of the state that represents a large set of runs, has also\nbeen recovered for N = 2, but with an unsatisfactorily long time scale. For large N, the truncation process took\nplace rapidly and was achieved before the registration in the apparatus really began, but here, whatever the parameters\nε and λ, the expectation values h ŝ x i, h ŝy i and the off-diagonal correlations embedded in P↑↓ and P↓↑ fade out over a\ntruncation time τtrunc given by (8.39) or (8.42), which is longer than the registration time and even than the observation\ntime if 2λ \u001c ε. It is difficult to regard such a slow decay as the “collapse” of the state.\nBy studying the case N = 2, we wished to test whether an environment-induced decoherence [32, 33, 40, 199,\n200, 201, 202] might cause truncation. Here the “environment” is the bath B, which is the source of irreversibility. It\nimposes thermal equilibrium to S + M, hence suppressing gradually the off-diagonal elements of D̂ which vanish at\nequilibrium, a suppression that we defined as “truncation”. However, usually, decoherence time scales are the shortest\nof all; here, for N = 2, contrary to what happened for N \u001d 1, the truncation time is not shorter than the registration\ntime.\nThe effect of the bath is therefore quite different for large and for small N. For N \u001d 1, we have seen in §§ 5.1.2 and\n6.2.4 that the rapid initial truncation was ensured by the large size of the pointer M, whereas bath-induced decoherence\n78 Every crow promotes her baby bird\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n109\n\nplayed only a minor role, being only one among the two possible mechanisms of suppression of recurrences. For N =\n2, the truncation itself is caused by the bath, but we cannot really distinguish decoherence from thermal equilibration:\nAlthough the dynamics of the diagonal and off-diagonal blocks of D̂ are decoupled, there is no neat separation of time\nscales for the truncation and the registration.\nA last feature of measurements, the uniqueness of the outcome of individual runs, is essential as it conditions both\nBorn’s rule and von Neumann’s reduction. We have stressed (§§ 1.1.2 and 1.3.2) that truncation, which concerns the\nlarge set of runs of the measurement, does not imply reduction, which concerns individual runs. The latter property\nwill be proven in section 11 for the Curie–Weiss model; its explanation will rely on a coupling between the large\nnumber of eigenstates of M involved for N \u001d 1 in each ferromagnetic equilibrium state. Here, for N = 2, the\n“ferromagnetic” state is non degenerate, and that mechanism cannot be invoked.\nAnyhow, the process that we described cannot be regarded for N = 2 as a full measurement. Being microscopic,\nthe pair of spins M is not a “pointer” that can be observed directly. In order to get a stable signal, which provides\nus with information and which we may use at a macroscopic level, we need to couple M to a genuine macroscopic\napparatus. This should be done after the time τreg = (2~/γJ) exp[(J − 2g)/T ] when the correlations P↑↑ (m, t) =\nr↑↑ (0)δm,1 and P↓↓ (m, t) = r↓↓ (0)δm,−1 have been created between S and M. Then, S and M should be decoupled, and\nthe measurement of m should be performed in the delay τobs = (~/γJ) exp(J/T ). In this hypothetical process, the\ndecoupling of S and M will entail truncation, the correlations which survive for the duration τtrunc = 2τobs in P↑↓ and\nP↓↑ being destroyed.\nAltogether, it is not legitimate for small N to regard M + B as a “measurement apparatus”, since nothing can be\nsaid about individual runs. Anyhow, registering robustly the outcomes of the process so as to read them during a long\ndelay requires a further apparatus involving a macroscopic pointer. The system M, even accompanied with its bath, is\nnot more than a quantum device coupled to S. However, its marginal state is represented by a diagonal density matrix,\nin the basis which diagonalizes m̂, so that the respective probabilities of m = 0, m = +1 and m = −1, from which we\nmay infer r↑↑ (0) and r↓↓ (0), can be determined by means of an apparatus with classical features.\n8.1.6. Can one simultaneously “measure” non-commuting variables?\n79\n\nԵրկու երնեկ մի տեղ չեն լինում:\nArmenian proverb\nAlthough the process described above cannot be regarded as an ideal measurement, we have seen that it allows\nus to determine the diagonal elements r↑↑ (0) and r↓↓ (0) of the density matrix of S at the initial time. Surprisingly,\nthe same device may also give us access to the off-diagonal elements, owing to the pathologically slow truncation.\nImagine S and M are decoupled at some time τdec of order τtrunc . For 2λ \u001c ε, this time can be shorter than the\nobservation time, so that a rapid measurement of m will inform us statistically on r↑↑ (0) and r↓↓ (0). However, the\ntransverse components of the spin S have not disappeared on average, and r↑↓ (τdec ) is given at the decoupling time\nand later on by\n√\nX\nε + ε2 − 4λ2 −τdec /τtrunc\nr↑↓ (τdec ) =\nP↑↓ (m, τdec ) = r↑↓ (0) √\ne\n.\n(8.45)\n2 ε2 − 4λ2\nm\nA subsequent measurement on S in the x-direction at a time t > τdec will then provide r↑↓ (t) + r↓↑ (t) = 2<r↓↑ (τdec ).\nIf the various parameters entering (8.45) are well controlled, we can thus, through repeated measurements, determine\nindirectly r↑↓ (0) + r↓↑ (0), as well as r↑↑ (0) and r↓↓ (0).\nNote, however, that such a procedure gives us access only to the statistical properties of the initial state of S, and\nthat von Neumann’s reduction is precluded.\nThus a unique experimental setting may be used to determine the statistics of the non-commuting observables ŝ x\nand ŝz . This possibility is reminiscent of a general result [279]; see also [280, 281]. Suppose we wish to determine all\nthe matrix elements ri j of the unknown n × n density matrix of a system S at the initial time. Coupling during some\ndelay S with a similar auxiliary system S0 , the initial state of which is known, leads to some density matrix for the\n79 Two hopeful dreams cannot coexist\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n110\n\ncompound system. The set ri j is thus mapped onto the n2 diagonal elements of the latter. These diagonal elements\nmay be measured simultaneously by means of a single apparatus, and inversion of the mapping yields the whole set\nri j . Here the magnet M plays the role of the auxiliary system S0 ; we can thus understand the paradoxical possibility\nof determining the statistics of both ŝ x and ŝz with a single device.\nIn this context we note that the simultaneous measurement of non-commuting observables is an important chapter of modern quantum mechanics. Its recent developments are given in [273, 274, 275, 276, 277] (among other\nreferences) and reviewed in [278].\nWith this setup we can also repeat measurements in the z-direction and see how much lapse should be in between\nto avoid non-idealities.\n8.2. Measuring a non-conserved quantity\nL’homme est plein d’imperfections, mais ce n’est pas\nétonnant si l’on songe à l’époque où il a été créé 80\nAlphonse Allais\nIt has been stressed by Wigner [282] that an observable that does not commute with some conserved quantity of\nthe total system (tested system S plus apparatus A) cannot be measured exactly, and the probability of unsuccessful\nexperiments has been estimated by Araki and Yanase [76, 283]. (Modern developments of this Wigner-Araki-Yanase\nlimitation are given in [270, 271, 272].) However, neither the irreversibility nor the dynamics of the measurement\nprocess were considered. We focus here on the extreme case in which Wigner’s conserved quantity is the energy\nitself. We have assumed till now that the measured observable ŝz commuted with the full Hamiltonian of S + A. This\nhas allowed us to split the dynamical analysis into two separate parts: The diagonal blocks R↑↑ , R↓↓ of the full density\nmatrix of S + A are not coupled to the off-diagonal blocks R↑↓ , R↓↑ . This gives rise, for N \u001d 1, to a large ratio between\nthe time scales that characterize the truncation and the registration.\nWe will discuss, by solving a slightly modified version of our model, under which conditions one can still measure\na quantity which is not conserved. We allow therefore transitions between different eigenvalues of ŝz , by introducing\na magnetic field that acts on S. The part ĤS of the Hamiltonian, instead of vanishing as in (3.4), is taken as\nĤS = −b ŝy .\n\n(8.46)\n\nWe take as measuring device a large, Ising magnet, with q = 2 and N \u001d 1.\nWe wish to study how the additional field affects the dynamics of the measurement. We shall therefore work out\nthe equations at lowest order\n√ in b, which however need not be finite as N → ∞. In fact, a crucial parameter turns out\nto be the combination b/g N.\n8.2.1. The changes in the dynamics\nPlus ça change, plus c’est la même chose81\nFrench saying\nThe formalism of subsection 4.2 remains unchanged, the unperturbed Hamiltonian being now\n1\nJN m̂2 .\n2\nThe additional contribution (8.46) entersh the basic\ni equation (4.5) in two different ways.\n(i) On the left-hand side, the term − ĤS , D̂ /i~ yields a contribution\n!\nb R̂↑↓ + R̂↓↑ R̂↓↓ − R̂↑↑\n~ R̂↓↓ − R̂↑↑ −R̂↑↓ − R̂↓↑\nĤ0 = ĤS + ĤSA + ĤM = −b ŝy − Ngm̂ ŝz −\n\n80 Man is full of imperfections, but this is not surprising if one considers when he was created\n81 The more it changes, the more it remains the same\n\n(8.47)\n\n(8.48)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n111\n\nto dD̂/dt which couples the diagonal and off-diagonal sectors of (3.18). Accordingly, we must add to the right-hand\nside of the equation of motion (4.16) for dP↑↑ /dt the term ~−1 b(P↑↓ + P↓↑ ), and subtract it from the equation for\ndP↓↓ /dt; we should add to the equations (4.18) for dP↑↓ /dt and dP↓↑ /dt the term ~−1 b(P↓↓ − P↑↑ ).\n(ii) The presence of ĤS in Ĥ0 has another, indirect effect. The operators σ̂(n)\na (u) defined by (4.4), which enter the\n(n)\nright-hand side of eq. (4.5), no longer commute with ŝz . In fact, while σ̂(n)\nz (u) still equals σ̂z , the operators\nh (n) i†\n(n) −iĤ0 (m̂+δm)u/~ iĤ0 (m̂)u/~\nσ̂(n)\ne\n= e−iĤ0 (m̂)u/~ eiĤ0 (m̂−δm)u/~ σ̂(n)\n+ (u) = σ̂− (u) = σ̂+ e\n+\n\n(8.49)\n\nnow contain contributions in ŝ x and ŝy , which can be found by using the expression (8.47) of Ĥ0 and the identity\nexp(i a · ŝ) = cos(a) + i sin(a) a · ŝ/a. For N \u001d 1 and arbitrary b, we should therefore modify the bath terms in dPi j /dt\nby using the expression\n\"\n(n)\nσ̂(n)\n+ (u) = σ̂ exp\n\nNgm̂ ŝz + b ŝy\n2im̂u\nJ + Ng2 2 2 2\n~\nN g m̂ + b2\n\n!#\n,\n\n(8.50)\n\n\u0011\n\u0010 p\ninstead of (B.7); we have dropped in the square bracket contributions that oscillate rapidly as exp 2iu N 2 g2 m̂2 + b2 /~\nwith factors ŝ x and coefficients of order 1/N.\nExcept in § 8.2.5 we assume that S and A remain coupled at all times. Their joint distribution D̂(t) is then expected\nto be driven by the bath B to an equilibrium D̂(tf ) ∝ exp(−Ĥ0 /T ) at large times. The temperature T is imposed by the\nfactor K(u) that enters the equation of motion (4.5), while Ĥ0 is imposed by the form of σ̂(n)\na (u). The additional terms\nin (8.50) are needed to ensure that S + M reaches the required equilibrium state. As discussed in § 7.1.4, invariance\nis broken in the final state. Its density operator involves two incoherent contributions, for whichh\u0010the magnetization\n\u0011 of\ni\nM lies either close to +mF or close to −mF . In the first one, the marginal state of S is r̂(tf ) ∝ exp b ŝy + NgmF ŝz /T .\nIf b \u001c Ng, a condition that we will impose from now on, this state cannot be distinguished from the projection\non sz = +1. As when b = 0, the sign of the observed magnetization ±mF of M is fully correlated with that of the\nz-component of the spin S in the final state, while h ŝ x (tf )i = h ŝy (tf )i = 0. If dynamical stability of subensembles is\nensured as in § 11.2.4, the process is consistent with von Neumann’s reduction, and it can be used as a preparation.\nNevertheless, nothing warrants the weights of the two possible outcomes, +mF , sz = +1 and −mF , sz = −1, to\nbe equal to the diagonal elements r↑↑ (0) and r↓↓ (0) of the initial density matrix: Born’s rule may be violated. A full\nstudy of the dynamics is required to evaluate these weights, so as to determine whether the process is still a faithful\nmeasurement.\nThis study will be simplified by noting that the expression (8.50) depends on b only through the ratio b/Ngm̂. Once\nthe registration has been established, at times of order τreg , the relevant eigenvalues of m̂, of order mB , are finite for\nlarge N and the field b does not contribute to σ̂(n)\nNg.

However, we have shown (section 6) that for the off-diagonal blocks the bath terms in (4.29) have\nthe sole effect of inhibiting the recurrences in P↑↓ (m, t). Anyhow, such recurrences are not seen when m is treated as\na continuous variable.

Over a short lapse around any time t, the\ncoupled equations for C x = P↑↓ + P↓↑ , Cy = iP↑↓ − iP↓↑ and Cz = P↑↑ − P↓↓ simply describe, for each m, a Larmor\nprecession of S [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65] submitted to the field b along ŷ and to the field Ngm along ẑ, where m is a\nclassical random variable governed by the probability distribution PM (m, t). The slow evolution of PM (m, t) is coupled\nto this rapid precession through (8.52) and (8.53).\n8.2.2.

Truncation is an ongoing process, which may\ntake place (if b is sufficiently large) for t \u001d τtrunc : The non-conservation of the measured quantity sz tends to feed\nup the off-diagonal components R̂↑↓ and R̂↓↑ of the density matrix D̂ of S + M.

The stationary value of h ŝy m̂(t)i agrees\nwith the value of the random field applied to S. The precession around ŷ explains the factor −bh ŝz (0)i in h ŝ x (t)i. The\nrotation\n√ around z hinders h ŝ x (t)i through randomness of m, its effects are characterized by the parameter Ngm, of order\ngδ0 N. This explains the occurrence of this parameter in the denominator. Moreover, this same rotation around ẑ\nfeeds up h ŝy (t)i from h ŝ x (t)i, and it takes place in a direction depending on the sign of m; as soon as registration begins,\nthis sign of m is on average positive for sz = +1, negative for sz = −1.Thus the two rotations around ŷ and ẑ yield\na polarization along x̂ with a sign opposite to that along ẑ, whereas the polarization along ŷ is positive whatever that\nalong ẑ. When√t \u001d τleak , the random values of m are all positive (for P↑↑ ) or all negative (for\n√ P↓↓ ), with a modulus\nlarger than 1/ N. Hence S precesses around an axis close to +ẑ or −ẑ, even if b is of order g N, so that the leakage\nfrom Cz towards C x and Cy is inhibited for such times. Altogether, the duration of the effect is τleak , and its size is\n√\ncharacterized by the dimensionless parameter b/g N.\n8.2.4. Possibility of an ideal measurement\nThe loftier and more distant the ideal,\nthe greater its power to lift up the soul\nHebrew proverb\nWe wish to find an upper bound on the field b such that the process can be used as a measurement. Obviously, if\nthe Larmor period τLarmor = π~/b is longer than the registration time τreg = ~/γ(J − T ), we can completely disregard\nthe field. However, we shall see that this condition, b \u001c πγ(J − T ), is too stringent and that even large violations of\nthe conservation law of the measured quantity ŝz do not prevent an ideal measurement.\nWe therefore turn to the registration, still assuming that S and A remain coupled till the end of the process. At\nlowest order in b, the right-hand side of (8.52) and (8.53) is expressed by (8.55) with (8.56). The Green’s functions\nG↑ and G↓ of the left-hand sides are given by (F.10) with h = +g and h = −g, respectively.

A large\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n116\n\nnumber N of degrees of freedom of the pointer and/or a large coupling g inhibit the transitions between sz = +1 and\nsz = −1 induced by ĤS , making the leakage time short and rendering the field b ineffective. If g is small, approaching\nthe lower bound (7.41), the constraint (8.71) becomes stringent, since γ \u001c 1. Too weak a coupling γ with the bath\nmakes the registration so slow that b has time to spoil the measurement during the leakage delay.\n8.2.5. Switching on and off the system-apparatus interaction\nHaastige spoed is zelden goed84\nDutch proverb\nThe condition (8.71), which ensures that the process behaves as an ideal measurement although ŝz is not conserved,\nhas been established by assuming that S and A interact from the time t = 0 to the time t = tf at which the pointer has\nreached ±mF . However, in a realistic ideal measurement, S and A should be decoupled both before t = 0 and after\nsome time larger than τreg . At such times, the observable ŝz to be tested suffers oscillations with period τLarmor = πb/~,\nwhich may be rapid. Two problems then arise.\n(i) The repeated process informs us through reading of M about the diagonal elements of the density matrix r̂ of\nS, not at any time, but at the time when the coupling g is switched on, that we took as the origin of time t = 0. Before\nthis time, the diagonal elements r↑↑ (t) and r↓↓ (t) oscillate freely with the period τLarmor . If we wish the outcomes of\nM to be meaningful, we need to control, within a latitude small compared to τLarmor , the time at which the interaction\nis turned on. Moreover, this coupling must occur suddenly: The time during which g rises from 0 to its actual value\nshould be short, much shorter than the leakage time.\n(ii) Suppose that the coupling g is switched off at some time τdec larger than τregR, the condition (8.71) being\nsatisfied. At this decoupling time P↑↑ (m, τdec ) presents a peak for m > 0, with weight dm m P↑↑ (m, τdec ) = r↑↑ (0),\nP↓↓ (m, τdec ) a peak for m < 0 with weight r↓↓ (0), while P↑↓ (m, τdec ) vanishes. Afterwards the system and the apparatus\nevolve\nindependently. The Larmor Rprecession of S [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65] manifests itself through oscillations of\nR\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndm P↑↑ (m, t) − P↓↓ (m, t) and of dm P↑↓ (m, t) + P↓↑ (m, t) , while M relaxes under the influence of the bath B.\nThe two peaks of the probability distribution PM (m, t) = P↑↑ (m, t) + P↓↓ (m, t) move apart, towards +mF and −mF ,\nrespectively. At the final time tf , once the apparatus has reached equilibrium with broken invariance, we can observe\non the pointer the outcomes +mF with probability r↑↑ (0), or −mF with probability r↓↓ (0). Thus the counting rate agrees\nwith Born’s rule. However the process is not an ideal measurement in von Neumann’s sense: Even if the outcome of\nA is well-defined at each run (section 11), it is correlated not with the state of S at the final reading time, but only\nwith its state r̂(τdec ) at the decoupling time, a state which has been kept unchanged since the truncation owing to the\ninteraction of S with M. Selecting the events with +mF at the time tf cannot be used as a preparation of S in the state\n|↑i, since r̂(t) has evolved after the decoupling.\n8.3. Attempt to simultaneously measure non-commutative variables\nJe moet niet teveel hooi op je vork nemen85\nQui trop embrasse mal étreint 86\nDutch and French proverbs\nBooks of quantum mechanics tell that a precise simultaneous measurement of non-commuting variables is impossible [10, 11, 31, 48, 85]. It is, however, physically sensible to imagine a setting with which we would try to perform\nsuch a measurement approximately [273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 284]. It is interesting to analyze the corresponding\ndynamical process so as to understand how it differs from a standard measurement.\nConsider first successive measurements. In a first stage the component ŝz of the spin S is tested by coupling S to\nA between the time t = 0 and some time τdec at which ĤSA is switched off. If τdec is larger than the registration time\nτreg , the apparatus A produces m = mF with probability r↑↑ (0) and m = −mF with probability r↓↓ (0). An interaction\nĤSA0 is then switched on between S and a second apparatus A0 , analogous to A but coupled to the component ŝv of\nŝ in some v-direction. It is the new diagonal marginal state r̂(τdec ), equal to the diagonal part of r̂(0), which is then\n84 Being quick is hardly ever good\n85 You should not put too much hay on your fork\n86 He who embraces too much fails to catch\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n117\n\ntested by A0 . In this measurement of ŝv the probability of reading m0 = +mF on A0 and finding ŝ in the v-direction\nis r↑↑ (0) cos2 12 θ + r↓↓ (0) sin2 12 θ, where θ and φ are the Euler angles of v. The measurement of ŝv alone would have\nprovided the additional contribution <r↑↓ (0) sin θeiφ . We therefore recover dynamically all the standard predictions\nof quantum mechanics.\nThings will be different if the second apparatus is switched on too soon after the first one or at the same time.\n8.3.1. A model with two apparatuses\nLife is transparent,\nbut we insist on making it opaque\nConfucius\nLet us imagine we attempt to measure simultaneously the non-commuting components ŝz and ŝ x of the spin ŝ. To\nthis aim we extend our model by assuming that, starting from the time t = 0, S is coupled with two apparatuses A\nand A0 of the same type as above, A0 being suited to the measurement of ŝ x . We denote by γ0 , g0 , N 0 , J 0 , T 0 , . . . ,\nthe parameters of the second apparatus. The overall Hamiltonian Ĥ = ĤSA + ĤSA0 + ĤA + ĤA0 thus involves, in\naddition to the contributions defined in subsection 3.2, the Hamiltonian ĤA0 of the second apparatus A0 , analogous to\nPN 0 0 (n)\nĤA = ĤM + ĤB + ĤMB , with magnetization m0 = (1/N 0 ) n=1\nσ̂ x , and the coupling term\nĤSA0 = −N 0 g0 ŝ x m̂0\n\n(8.72)\n\nof A and S. The solution of the Liouville–von Neumann equation for S + A+A should determine how the indications\nof A and A0 can inform us about the initial state r̂(0) of S, and how the final state of S is correlated with these\nindications.\nWe readily note that such a dynamical process can not behave as an ideal measurement, since we expect that,\nwhatever the initial state r̂(0) of S, its final state will be perturbed.\nThe equations of motion are worked out as in section 4. After elimination of the baths B and B0 at lowest order\nin γ and γ0 , the density operator D̂ of S + M + M0 can be parametrized as in § 3.3.1 and § 4.4.1 by four functions\nPi j (m, m0 , t), where i, j =↑, ↓ refer to S, and where the magnetizations m and m0 behave as random variables. However,\nsince the functions Pi j are now coupled, it is more suitable to express the dynamics in terms of PMM0 (m, m0 , t) =\nP↑↑ + P↓↓ , which describes the joint probability distribution of m and m0 , and of the set Ca (m, m0 , t) defined for a = x, y\nand z by (3.30), which describe the correlations between ŝa and the two magnets M and M0 . The density operator D̂(t)\nof S + M + M0 generalizing (3.18), with (3.26), (3.29) and (3.30), is\n0\n\n0\n\nD̂(t) =\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\nPMM0 (m̂, m̂0 , t) + C(m̂, m̂0 , t) · ŝ .\nNN 0G(m̂)G(m̂0 )\n\n(8.73)\n\n(There is no ambiguity in this definition, since m̂ and m̂0 commute.) The full dynamics are thus governed by coupled\nequations for the functions PMM0 (m, m0 , t) and C(m, m0 , t) which parametrize D̂(t). The initial state D̂(0) is factorized\nas r̂(0) ⊗ R̂M (0) ⊗ R̂M0 (0), where R̂M (0) and R̂M0 (0) describe the metastable paramagnetic states (3.46) of M and M0 ,\nso that the initial conditions are\nPMM0 (m, m0 , 0) = PM (m, 0)PM0 (m0 , 0),\n\nC(m, m0 , 0) = PMM0 (m, m0 , 0)hŝ(0)i,\n\n(8.74)\n\nwhere PM (m, 0) and PM0 (m0 , 0) have the Gaussian form (3.49) and where hŝ(0)i is the initial polarization of S.\nTwo types of contributions enter ∂PMM0 /∂t and ∂C/∂t, the first one active on the time scale τtrunc , and the second\none on the time scale τreg , but these time scales need not be very different here. On the one hand, for given m and m0 ,\nthe coupling ĤSA + ĤSA0 of S with the magnets M and M0 behaves as a magnetic field b applied to S. This effective\nfield is equal to\n\nb(m, m0 ) =\n\n2N 0 g0 m0\n2Ngm\nẑ +\nx̂ = bû,\n~\n~\n\nb(m, m0 ) ≡ |b(m, m0 )| =\n\n2\n~\n\nq\n\nN 2 g2 m2 + N 02 g02 m02 ,\n\nwhere ẑ and x̂ are the unit vectors in the z- and x-direction, respectively.

The distribution\nPMM0 (m, m0 , t) is insensitive to the part ĤSA + ĤSA0 of the Hamiltonian, and therefore evolves slowly, only under the\neffect of the baths.\nOn the other hand, ∂PMM0 /∂t and ∂C/∂t involve contributions from the baths B and B0 , which can be derived from\nthe right-hand sides of (4.30) and (4.29). They couple all four functions PMM0 and C, they are characterized by the\ntime scales τreg and τ0reg , and they depend on all parameters of the model. In contrast with what happened for a single\napparatus, the effects of the precession (8.76) and of the baths can no longer be separated. Indeed, the precession tends\nto eliminate the components of C(m, m0 , t) that are perpendicular to b, but the baths tend to continuously activate the\ncreation of such components. The truncation, which for a single apparatus involved only the off-diagonal sectors\nand was achieved after a brief delay, is now replaced by an overall damping process taking place along with the\nregistration, under the simultaneous contradictory effects of the couplings of M and M0 with S and with the baths.\nSuch an interplay, together with the coupling of four functions PMM0 , C of three variables m, m0 , t, make the\nequations of motion difficult to solve, whether analytically or numerically. A qualitative analysis will, however,\nsuffice to provide us with some interesting conclusions.\n8.3.2. Structure of the outcome\nNote first that the positivity of the density operator (8.73), maintained by the dynamics, is expressed by the\ncondition\nPMM0 (m, m0 , t) ≥ |C(m, m0 , t)|,\n\n(8.77)\n\nwhich holds at any time.\nThe outcome of the process is characterized by the limit, for t larger than the registration time τreg , of the distributions PMM0 and C. In this last stage of the evolution, the interaction of M with the bath B is expected to drive it towards\neither one of the two equilibrium states at temperature T , for which the normalized distribution PM⇑ (m) (or PM⇓ (m))\nexpressed by (3.57) is concentrated near m = +mF (or m = −mF ). In order to avoid the possibility of a final relaxation\nof M towards its metastable paramagnetic state, which may produce failures as in § 7.3.4, we consider here only a\nquadratic coupling J2 . Likewise, M0 is stabilized into either one of the ferromagnetic states P0M0 ⇑ (m0 ) (or PM0 ⇓ (m0 ))\nwith m0 ' +m0F (or m0 = −m0F ). Hence, PMM0 (m, m0 , t), which describes the statistics of the indications of the pointers,\nends up as a sum of four narrow peaks which settle at m = εmF , m0 = ε0 m0F , with ε = ±1, ε0 = ±1, to wit,\nX X\nPMM0 (m, m0 , t) 7→\nPεε0 PMε (m)PM0 ε0 (m0 ).\n(8.78)\nε=±1 ε0 =±1\n\nThe weights Pεε0 of these peaks characterize the proportions of counts detected on M and M0 in repeated experiments;\nthey are the only observed quantities.\nThe precession (8.76) together with smoothing over m and m0 eliminates the component Cy of C, so that the\nsubsequent evolution keeps no memory of Cy (m, m0 , 0). Thus, among the initial data (8.74) pertaining to S, only\nh ŝ x (0)i and h ŝz (0)i are relevant to the determination of the final state: the frequencies Pεε0 of the outcomes depend\nonly on h ŝ x (0)i and h ŝz (0)i (and on the parameters of the apparatuses).\nIf h ŝ x (0)i = h ŝz (0)i = 0 we have Pεε0 = 14 due to the symmetry m ↔ −m, m0 ↔ −m0 . Likewise, if h ŝ x (0)i = 0, the\nsymmetry m0 ↔ −m0 implies that P++ = P+− and P−+ = P−− . Since the equations of motion are linear, P++ − P−+ is\nin this situation proportional to h ŝz (0)i; we define the proportionality coefficient λ by Pε+ = 14 (1 + ελh ŝz (0)i). In the\nsituation h ŝz (0)i = 0 we have similarly P+ε0 = P−ε0 = 14 (1 + ε0 λ0 h ŝ x (0)i). Relying on the linearity of the equations of\nmotion, we find altogether for an arbitrary initial state of S the general form for the probabilities Pεε0 :\n\u0001\n1\n1 + ελh ŝz (0)i + ε0 λ0 h ŝ x (0)i ,\n4\nwhere h ŝz (0)i = r↑↑ (0) − r↓↓ (0), h ŝ x (0)i = r↑↓ (0) + r↓↑ (0). We term λ and λ0 the efficiency factors.\nPεε0 =\n\n(8.79)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n119\n\nIn the long time limit, the functions C(m.m0 , t) also tend to sums of four peaks located at m = ±mF , m0 = ±m0F , as\nimplied by (8.77). With each peak is associated a direction uεε0 , given by (8.75) where m = εmF , m0 = ε0 m0F , around\nwhich the precession (8.76) takes place. The truncation process eliminates the component of C perpendicular to uεε0 ,\nfor each peak. Thus, if in their final state the apparatuses M and M0 indicate εmF , ε0 m0F , the spin S is lead into a state\npartly polarized in the direction uεε0 of the effective field b generated by the two ferromagnets.\n8.3.3. A fully informative statistical process\nYou may look up for inspiration or look down in desperation,\nbut do not look sideways for information\nIndian proverb\nA well-defined indication for both pointers M and M0 can be obtained here in each individual run, because the\nargument of § 11.2.4 holds separately for the apparatuses A and A0 at the end of the process. A mere counting of the\npair of outcomes ε, ε0 then provides experimentally the probability (8.79).\nHowever, the present process cannot be regarded as an ideal measurement. On the one hand, the above-mentioned\ncorrelations between the final state of S and the indications of the apparatus are not complete; they are limited by\nthe inequality (8.77). In an ideal measurement the correlation must be complete: if the apparatuses are such that\nthey provide well-defined outcomes at each run (section 11), and if for a given run we read +mF on the apparatus M\nmeasuring ŝz , the spin S must have been led by the ideal process into the pure state |↑i. Here we cannot make such\nassertions about an individual system, and we cannot use the process as a preparation.\nOn the other hand, in an ideal measurement, the outcome of the process is unique for both S and M in case S is\ninitially in an eigenstate of the tested quantity. Suppose the spin S is initially oriented up in the z-direction, that is,\nr̂(0) = |↑ih↑|. The response of the apparatuses M and M0 is given by (8.79) as\nP++ = P+− =\n\n1\n(1 + λ),\n4\n\nP−+ = P−− =\n\n1\n(1 − λ),\n4\n\n(8.80)\n\nso that there exists a probability 12 (1 − λ) to read the wrong result −mF on M. Indeed, without even solving the\nequations of motion to express the efficiency factors λ and λ0 in terms of the various parameters of the model, we can\nassert that λ is smaller than 1: Because all Pεε0 must be non-negative for any initial state of S, and because (8.79) has\nthe form 41 (1 + a · hŝ(0)i), we must have |a| < 1, so that λ and λ0 should satisfy\nλ2 + λ02 ≤ 1,\n\n(8.81)\n\nand because not only ŝz but also ŝ x are tested, λ should be non zero so that the probability of failure 12 (1 − λ) is finite.\nIt is therefore clear why the attempt to perform a simultaneous ideal measurement of ŝ x and ŝz fails. Both Born’s rule\n0\n0\n\nand von Neumann’s truncation are violated, because A and A influence each other though their couplings to S.\nNevertheless, consider a set of repeated experiments in which we read simultaneously the indications of the two\napparatuses M and M0 . If the runs are sufficiently numerous, we can determine the probabilities Pεε0 from the frequencies of occurrence of the four possible outcomes ±mF , ±mF0 . Let us assume that the coefficients λ, λ0 , which\ndepend on the parameters of the model, take significant values. This requires an adequate choice of these parameters.\nIn particular, the couplings g and g0 , needed to trigger the beginning of the registration, should however be small\nand should soon be switched off so as to reduce the blurring effect of the precession around b. This smallness is\nconsistent with the choice of a second order transition for M, already noted. Finally, the couplings γ, γ0 should ensure\nregistration before disorder is settled. Under such conditions, inversion of eq. (8.79) yields\n1\n(P++ + P+− − P−+ − P−− ),\nλ\n1\nh ŝ x (0)i = r↑↓ (0) + r↓↑ (0) = 0 (P++ − P+− + P−+ − P−− ).\nλ\nh ŝz (0)i\n\n= r↑↑ (0) − r↓↓ (0) =\n\n(8.82)\n\nThus, a sequence of repeated experiments reveals the initial expectation values of both ŝz and ŝ x , although these\nobservables do not commute.\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n120\n\nParadoxically, as regards the determination of an unknown initial density matrix, the present process is more\ninformative than an ideal measurement with a single apparatus [279]. Repeated measurements of ŝz yield r↑↑ (0) (and\nr↓↓ (0)) through counting of the outcomes ±mF of M. Here we moreover find through repeated experiments the real\npart of r↑↓ (0). However, more numerous runs are needed to reach a given precision if λ and λ0 are small. (If the\nparameters of the model are such that λ and λ0 nearly vanish, the relaxation of M and M0 is not controlled by S, all\nPεε0 lie close to 14 , and the observation of the outcomes is not informative since they are fully random.)\nMore generally, for a repeated process using three apparatuses M, M0 and M00 coupled to ŝz , ŝ x and ŝy , respectively,\nthe statistics of readings allows us to determine simultaneously all matrix elements of the initial density operator r̂(0).\nThe considered single compound apparatus thus provides full statistical information about the state r̂(0) of S. Our\nknowledge is gained indirectly, through an expression of the type (8.82) which involves both statistics and calibration\nso as to determine the parameters λ, λ0 and λ00 . A process of the present type, although it violates the standard rules of\nthe ideal measurement, can be regarded as a complete statistical measurement of the initial state of S. The knowledge\nof the efficiency factors allows us to determine simultaneously the statistics of the observables currently regarded as\nincompatible. The price to pay is the loss of precision due to the fact that the efficiency factors are less than 1, which\nrequires a large number of runs.\nThe dynamics thus establish a one-to-one correspondence between the initial density matrix of S, which embeds\nthe whole quantum probabilistic information on S, and the classical probabilities of the various indications that may\nbe registered by the apparatuses at the final time. The possibility of such a mapping was considered in [279]. The\nsize of the domain in which the counting rates may lie is limited; for instance, if S is initially polarized along z in\n(8.79), no Pεε0 can lie beyond the interval [ 14 (1 − λ), 14 (1 + λ)]. The limited size of the domain for the probabilities\nof the apparatus indications is needed to reconcile the classical nature of these probabilities with the peculiarities\nof the quantum probabilities of S that arise from non commutation. It also sets limitations on the precision of the\nmeasurement.\nMotivated by the physics of spin-orbit interaction in solids, Sokolovski and Sherman recently studied a model\nrelated to (8.72) [285]. Two components of the spin 12 couple not with collective magnetizations as in (8.72), but with\nthe components of the momentum (the proper kinetic energy is neglected so that these are the only two terms in the\nHamiltonian). The motivation for studying this model is the same as above: to understand the physics of simultaneous\nmeasurement for two non-commuting observables [285]. The authors show that, as a result of interaction, the average\ncomponents of the momentum get correlated with the time-averaged values of the spin [instead of the initial values of\nthe spin as in (8.78), (8.79)]. This difference relates to the fact that the model by Sokolovski and Sherman does not\nhave macroscopic measuring apparatuses that would enforce relaxation in time.\n8.3.4. Testing Bell’s inequality\nLove levels all inequalities\nItalian proverb\nBell’s inequality for an EPR [51] pair of spins is expressed in the CHSH form as [286]\n(2)\n(1) (2)\n(1) (2)\n(1) (2)\n|h ŝ(1)\na ŝa0 i + h ŝb ŝa0 i + h ŝa ŝb0 i − h ŝb ŝb0 i| ≤ 2,\n\n(8.83)\n\n(1)\n(1)\nin the\nwhich holds for classical random variables s = ±1. If ŝ(1)\na and ŝb are the components of a quantum spin ŝ\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\n0\n0\ntwo fixed directions a and b, and ŝa0 and ŝb0 the components the other spin ŝ in directions a and b , the left-hand\n√\nside of (8.83) can rise up to 2 2 87 .\nStandard measurement devices allow us to test simultaneously a pair of commuting observables, for instance ŝ(1)\na\n(1) (2)\nand ŝ(2)\na0 . At least theoretically, the counting rates in repeated runs directly provide their correlation, namely h ŝa ŝa0 i.\n(1)\n(2)\n(2)\nHowever, since ŝ(1)\na and ŝb , as well as ŝa0 and ŝb0 do not commute, we need four different settings to determine\nthe four terms of (8.83). Checking the violation of Bells inequalities thus requires combining the outcomes of four\nincompatible experimental contexts [150, 151, 152], in each of which the spin pair is being tested through repeated\n\n87 For the establishment of Bell-type equalities for SQUIDs, see Jaeger et al. [287]\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n121\n\nruns. This necessity may be regarded as a “contextuality loophole” [153, 154]. Either hidden variables exist, and\nthey cannot be governed by ordinary probabilities and ordinary logic, since there is no global distribution function\nthat would yield as marginals the partial results tested in the four different contexts. Or we must admit that quantum\nmechanics forbids us to put together the results of these different measurements. The latter alternative is favored by the\nsolution of models, in which the values of physical quantities do not pre-exist but are produced during a measurement\nprocess owing to the interaction between the system and the apparatus. Since these values reflect the reality of the\nsystem only within its context, it appears inconsistent to put them together [31, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154].\nIn the present situation it is tempting to imagine using a combination of apparatuses of the previous type so as to\n(1) (2)\n(2)\nsimultaneously test all four non-commuting observables ŝ(1)\na , ŝb , ŝa0 , and ŝb0 through repeated runs. Such a unique\nexperimental setting would bypass the contextuality loophole. However, as shown in § 8.3.3, the counting rates of the\n(1)\ntwo apparatuses associated with the components ŝ(1)\na and ŝb of the first spin are not directly related to the statistics of\n√\nthese components, but only reflect them through an efficiency factor λ at most equal to 1/ 2. For the pair of spins,\n(2)\none can generalize Eqs. (8.79) , (8.82), and deduce a correlation such as h ŝ(1)\na ŝa0 i from the statistical indications of the\ncorresponding apparatuses, but this quantum correlation is at least equal to twice the associated observed correlation\n(since 1/λ2 > 2).\nThus, with this experimental setting which circumvents the contextuallity loophole, the correlations directly exhibited by the counting rates satisfy Bell’s inequality; this is natural since the outcomes of the macroscopic apparatus\nare measured simultaneously and therefore have a classical nature [288]. However, from these very observations,\nwe can use standard quantum mechanics to analyse the results. We thus infer indirectly from the observations, by\nusing a mapping of the type (8.82), the tested quantum correlations (8.83) between spins components. Within a single\nset of repeated experiments where the various data are simultaneously registered, we thus acknowledge the violation of Bell’s inequality. Here this violation no longer appears as a consequence of merging incompatible sets of\nmeasurements, but as a consequence of a theoretical analysis of the ordinary correlations produced in the apparatus.\n9. Analysis of the results\nAnd the rain from heaven was restrained\nGenesis 8.2\nIn section 3 we have introduced the Curie–Weiss model for the quantum measurement of a spin 21 and in sections\n4–8 we have discussed the dynamics of the density operator characterizing a large set of runs. For the readers who\nhave not desired to go through all the details, and for those who did, we resume here the main points as a separate\nreading guide, and add pedagogical hints for making students familiar with the matter and techniques. We will discuss\nthe solution of the quantum measurement problem for this model in section 11 by considering properties of individual\nruns.\n9.1. Requirements for models of quantum measurements\nJ’ai perdu mon Eurydice88\nChe farò senza Euridice?89\nChristoph Willibald Gluck, Orphée et Eurydice; Orfeo ed Euridice\nA model for the apparatus A and its coupling with the tested system S that accounts for the various properties of\nideal quantum measurements should in principle satisfy the following requirements (“R”):\nR1: simulate as much as possible nearly ideal real experiments, and be sufficiently flexible to allow discussing imperfect processes;\nR2: ensure unbiased, robust and permanent registration by the pointer of A, which should therefore be macroscopic;\n88 I lost my Euridice\n89 What shall I do without Euridice?\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n122\n\nR3: involve an apparatus initially in a metastable state and evolving towards one or another stable state under the\ninfluence of S, so as to amplify this signal; the transition of A, instead of occurring spontaneously, is triggered by S;\nR4: include a bath where the free energy released because of the irreversibility of the process may be dumped;\nR5: be solvable so as to provide a complete scenario of the joint evolution of S + A and to exhibit the characteristic\ntimes;\nR6: conserve the tested observable;\nR7: lead to a final state devoid of “Schrödinger cats”; for the whole set of runs (truncation, § 1.3.2), and to a von\nNeumann reduced state for each individual run;\nR8: satisfy Born’s rule for the registered results;\nR9: produce, for ideal measurements or preparations, the required diagonal correlations between the tested system S\nand the indication of the pointer, as coded in the expression (9.1) for the final state of S + A;\nR10: ensure that the pointer gives at each run a well-defined indication; this requires sufficiently complex interactions\nwithin the apparatus (dynamical stability and hierarchic structure of subensembles, see subsection 11.2).\nThese features need not be fulfilled with mathematical rigor. A physical scope is sufficient, where violations may\noccur over unreachable time scales or with a negligible probability.\n9.2. Features of the Curie–Weiss model\nWhen you can measure what you are speaking about,\nand express it in numbers, you know something about it\nLord Kelvin\nThe above Curie–Weiss model is satisfactory in this respect (except for the requirement R10 which will be discussed in § 11.2.1). Its choice (section 3) has relied on a compromise between two conflicting requirements. On the\none hand, the apparatus A simulates a real object, a magnetic dot which behaves as a magnetic memory. On the other\nhand, the Hamiltonian of S + A is sufficiently simple so as to afford an explicit and detailed dynamical solution. The\nregistration device is schematized as a set M of N Ising spins (the magnet). The size of the dot is supposed to be much\nsmaller than the range of the interactions, both among the N spins and between them and the tested spin S. We further\nsimplify by taking into account only interactions between the z-components of the spins of M and S. Finally, as in a\nreal magnetic dot, phonons (with a quasi-ohmic behavior [121, 122, 174, 175, 197]) behave as a thermal bath B which\nensures equilibrium in the final state (Fig. 3.1). In spite of the schematic nature of the model, its solution turns out to\nexhibit a rich structure and to display the various features listed in subsection 9.1.\nIn particular, the choice for A = M + B of a system which can undergo a phase transition implies many properties\ndesirable for a measuring apparatus. The weakness of the interaction γ between each spin of the magnet M and\nthe phonon bath B, maintained at a temperature T lower than T c , ensures a long lifetime for the initial metastable\nparamagnetic state. By itself, the system M+B would ultimately relax spontaneously towards a stable state, but here\nits transition is triggered by S. The symmetry breaking in the dynamics of the measurement produces either one of\nthe two possible final stable ferromagnetic states, in one-to-one correspondence with the eigenvalues of the tested\nobservable ŝz of the system S, so that the sign of the final magnetization can behave as a pointer. It is this breaking\nof symmetry which underlies registration, entailing the irreversibility of the transition from the paramagnetic to either\none of the ferromagnetic macroscopic states. Moreover, the built-in symmetry between the two possible outcomes of\nA prevents the appearance of bias.\nAn essential property of a measurement, often overlooked, is the ability of the apparatus A to register the indication\nof the pointer. Here this is ensured by the large value of the number N of spins of M, which entails a neat separation\nbetween the two ferromagnetic states of M and their extremely long lifetime. This stability warrants a permanent\nand robust registration. The large value of N is also an essential ingredient in the proof of the uniqueness of the\nindication fo the pointer in each run (§ 11.2.4). In both the paramagnetic state and the ferromagnetic states, the\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n123\n\n√\npointer variable m presents statistical fluctuations negligible as 1/ N. Moreover, breaking of invariance makes\nquantum coherences ineffective (§ 11.2.4). The nature of the order parameter, a macroscopic magnetization, also\nmakes the result accessible to reading, processing or printing. These properties cannot be implemented in models for\nwhich the pointer is a microscopic object.\nThe coupling between the tested spin S and the apparatus A has been chosen in such a way that the observable ŝz\nis conserved, [ ŝz , Ĥ] = 0, so as to remain unperturbed during its measurement. This coupling triggers the beginning\nof the registration process, which thereby ends up in a situation which informs us about the the physical state of S at\nthe final moment, so that the process might be used as a measurement. This requires a sufficiently large value of the\ncoupling constant g which characterizes the interaction of S and M.\nOnce the probability distribution of the magnetization m has left the vicinity of m = 0 to move towards either +mF\nor −mF , the motion of this pointer is driven by the bath through the coupling γ between M and B. Somewhat later\nthe interaction g between S and A becomes ineffective and can as well be switched off. It is the interplay between\nthe metastability of the initial state of A, the initial triggering of M by S, and the ensuing action of B on M which\nensures an amplification of the initial perturbation. This amplification is necessary since the indication of the pointer\nM, which is macroscopic, should reflect an effect caused by the tested system S, which is microscopic — the very\nessence of a measurement.\nSuch a number of adequate properties makes this model attractive, but technical developments were needed to\nelaborate in sections 4 to 7 a rigorous proof that the final state of S + A has the form (1.7), viz.\nX\u0010\nX\n\u0011\nD̂ (tf ) =\nΠ̂i r̂ (0) Π̂i ⊗ R̂i =\npi r̂i ⊗ R̂i ,\n(9.1)\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere r̂ describes S and R̂ describes A. This form encompasses most among the required specific features of ideal\nquantum measurements, in particular the absence of off-diagonal terms. These developments have allowed us to\ndiscuss the conditions under which the process might be used as a measurement, and also to explore what happens if\none or another condition is violated.\nNote, however, that the final form (9.1) of the density operator of S + A concerns the statistics of a large set of runs\nof the measurement. This form is necessary, but not sufficient, to ensure that the interaction process can be regarded\nas an ideal measurement. It remains to elaborate the physical interpretation of this result by turning to individual\nmeasurements. We postpone his task to section 11.\n9.3. Scenario of the Curie–Weiss ideal measurement: the characteristic time scales\nWhen God made time, he made enough of it\nIrish proverb\nThe above study (sections 4–7) of the dynamical process undergone by S + A has revealed several successive steps\ninvolving different time scales. These steps will be resumed in section 11 (table 1).\n9.3.1. Preparation\nBefore S and A are coupled, A should be prepared in a metastable state. Indeed, in the old days of photography\nthe unexposed film was metastable and could not be prevented from evolving in the dark on a time scale of months. In\nour magnetic case, for quartic interactions within M, the lifetime of the paramagnetic initial state is extremely large,\nexponentially large in N. For quadratic interactions with coupling constant J, it was evaluated in section § 7.3.2 (eq.\n(7.66)) as\nτpara =\n\n√\n~\nln α N,\nγ(J − T )\n\n(9.2)\n\n√\nwhere α is typically of order 1/10, and it is larger than all other characteristic times for α N \u001d 1. We can thus engage\nthe measurement process by switching on the interaction between S and M during the delay τpara after preparation of\nA, before the paramagnetic state is spontaneously spoiled.\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n124\n\n9.3.2. Truncation\nLet us recall (§ 3.3.2 and Fig. 3.2) our decomposition of the density matrix D̂ of the total system S + A into blocks\nwith definite value sz =↑, ↓ of the tested spin component ŝz :\n!\nR̂↑↑ R̂↑↓\nD̂ =\n.\n(9.3)\nR̂↓↑ R̂↓↓\nThe first stage of the measurement process is the truncation, defined as the disappearance of the off-diagonal blocks\nR̂↑↓ and R̂↓↑ of the full density matrix (section 5). It takes place during the truncation time\nτtrunc = √\n\n~\n\n,\n\n2Nδ0 g\n\n(9.4)\n\nwhich is governed by the coupling\n√ constant g between S and M and the size N of the pointer (the fluctuation of M\nin the paramagnetic state is δ0 / N). This characteristic time is the shortest of all; its briefness reflects an effect\nproduced by a macroscopic object, the pointer M, on a microscopic one, the tested system S. During the delay τtrunc ,\nthe off-diagonal components a = x, y of the spin S decay on average as h ŝa (t)i = h ŝa (0)i exp[−(t/τtrunc )2 ].\n†\nOver the time scale τtrunc , only the off-diagonal blocks R̂↑↓ = R̂↓↑\nof the overall density matrix D̂ of S + A\nare affected by the evolution. Correlations between S and M, involving larger and larger numbers k = 1, 2, · · · of\nspins of M, such as h ŝa m̂k (t)ic ∝ tk exp[−(t/τtrunc )2 ] (a = x, y) are\n√ successively created in a cascade: They develop\nlater and later, each one reaches a small maximum for t = τtrunc k/2 and then tends to zero (§ 5.1.3 and Fig. 5.1).\nThe information originally carried by the off-diagonal elements of the initial density matrix of S are thus transferred\ntowards correlations which couple the system S with more and more spins of M and eventually decline (§ 5.1.4).\nWhen t increases far beyond τtrunc , all the matrix elements of R̂↑↓ that contribute to correlations of rank k \u001c N tend to\nzero. Correlations of higher rank k, for large but finite N, are the residue of reversibility of the microscopic evolution\ngenerated by ĤSA (§ 5.3.2).\nIf the total Hamiltonian of S + A did reduce to the coupling ĤSA = −Ng ŝz m̂ which produces the above behavior,\nthe truncation would be provisional, since S + A would periodically return to its initial state with the recurrence time\nτrecur =\n\nπ~\n,\n2g\n\n(9.5)\n\nmuch larger than τtrunc (§ 5.3.1). As in spin-echo experiments, the extremely small but extremely numerous correlations created by the interaction between S and the many spins of M would conspire to progressively reconstruct the\noff-diagonal blocks of the initial uncorrelated state of S + A: The reversibility and simplicity of the dynamics would\nruin the initial truncation.\nTwo possible mechanisms can prevent such recurrences to occur. In subsection 6.1 we slightly modify the model,\ntaking into account the (realistic) possibility of a spread δg in the coupling constants gn between S and each spin\nof the magnet M. The Hamiltonian (6.1) with the conditions (6.2) then produces the same initial truncation as with\nconstant g, over the same characteristic time τtrunc , but recurrences are now ruled out owing to the dispersion of the\n2\ngn , which produces an extra damping as exp[−(t/τM\nirrev ) ]. The irreversibility time induced by the spreading δg in the\nspin-magnet couplings,\nτM\nirrev = √\n\n~\n2Nδg\n\n,\n\n(9.6)\n\n√\nis intermediate between τtrunc and τrecur provided δg is sufficiently large, viz. g/ N \u001c δg \u001c g. As usual for a\nreversible linear evolution, a recurrence phenomenon still occurs here, but the recurrence time is inaccessibly large as\nshown in § 6.1.2 (see eq. (6.20)). The numerous but weak correlations between S and M, issued from the off-diagonal\nblocks of the initial density matrix of S, are therefore completely ineffective over any reasonable time lapse.\nAn alternative mechanism can also rule out any recurrence, even if the couplings between S and the spins are all\nequal (subsection 6.2). In this case, the required irreversibility is induced by the bath, which produces an extra decay,\nas exp[−NB(t)], of the off-diagonal blocks (the shape of B(t) is shown in Fig 6.1). The initial truncation of section 5,\nfor t \u001c 1/Γ, is not affected by the interaction with the bath if NB(τtrunc ) \u001c 1, that is, if\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n125\n\nγ~2 Γ2\n1,\n8πNδ40 g2\n\n(9.7)\n\nwhere Γ is the Debye cutoff on the phonon frequencies. At times t such that t \u001d ~/2πT , B(t) is quasi linear and the\nbath produces an exponential decay, as exp(−t/τBirrev ), where the bath-induced irreversibility time is defined as\n2~\n2~ tanh g/T\n'\n.\n(9.8)\nNγg\nNγT\nThis expression is a typical decoherence time, inversely proportional to the temperature T of B, to the bath-magnet\ncoupling γ and to the number N of degrees of freedom of the system S + M. (Note that τBirrev < ~/2πT .) The pth recurrence is then damped by a factor exp(−pτrecur /τBirrev ), so that the phonon bath eliminates all recurrences if\nτBirrev \u001c τrecur .\nAt this stage, the truncation is achieved in the sense that the off-diagonal blocks R̂↑↓ (t) and R̂↓↑ (t) of the density\noperator (9.3) of S + A have practically disappeared in a definitive way. The off-diagonal correlations created during\nthe truncation process have been irremediably destroyed at the end of this process, whereas the diagonal correlations\nneeded to register in A the tested properties of S are not yet created. See also § 11.2.4 below.\nτBirrev =\n\n9.3.3. Registration by the pointer\nOur fates are as registered in the scripts of heaven\nJapanese proverb\nJust after the above processes are achieved, the diagonal blocks R̂↑↑ (t) and R̂↓↓ (t) as well as the marginal density\noperator R̂(t) = trS D̂(t) = R̂↑↑ (t) + R̂↓↓ (t) of A remain nearly unaffected. The process cannot yet be regarded as a\nmeasurement: The pointer gives no indication, m is still small, and no correlation exists between A and the initial\nstate of S. The registration then starts and proceeds on time scales much larger than the above ones. It is a slower\nprocess because it leads to a change of a macroscopic object, the apparatus, triggered by the microscopic S. We term\nas “registration” a process which modifies the density operator of S + A associated with a large set of measurements.\nTo take advantage of the information stored thereby in the pointer of A, we need that for each individual measurement\nthe indication of this pointer be well-defined (see section 11).\nAfter a brief transient regime, the process becomes Markovian (§ 7.1.1). The evolution of each of the two diagonal\nblocks R̂↑↑ (t) or R̂↓↓ (t) can be expressed in terms of that of the corresponding probability distribution P↑↑ (m, t) or\nP↓↓ (m, t) for the magnetization of M, which obeys an equation of the Fokker-Planck type [254]. This equation,\npresenting classical features (§ 7.1.2), is governed for P↑↑ (m, t) by a drift velocity v(m) given by (7.6) and illustrated\nby Figs. 7.1 and 7.2, and by a diffusion coefficient given by (7.7). The irreversibility of the process is exhibited by an\nH-theorem (§ 7.1.3) which implies the decrease of the free energy of M. Thus, the total entropy of M + B increases,\nand some energy is dumped from M into B, while the transition leads from the paramagnetic to either one of the\nferromagnetic states. The existence of two possible final states is associated with breaking of ergodicity, discussed for\nfinite but large N in § 7.1.4 and subsection 7.3.\nFor purely quadratic interactions within M (the coupling (3.7) having the form J m̂2 ), the registration proceeds\nin three stages (§ 7.2.3), illustrated by Figs. 7.3 and 7.5. Firstly the distribution P↑↑ (m, t), initially a paramagnetic\nsymmetric peak around m = 0, is shifted faster and faster towards the positive direction of m and it widens, under the\nconjugate effects of both S and B. For suitably chosen parameters, after a delay given by Eq. (7.44),\n~\n,\n(9.9)\nγ(J − T )\nthat we term the first registration time, P↑↑ (m, t) is entirely located in the positive region of m, its tail in the region\nm < 0 has then become negligible. Symmetrically, P↓↓ (m, t) lies entirely in the m < 0 region for t > τreg . Thereafter\nthe coupling between M and S becomes ineffective and may be switched off, so that the registration is virtually, but\nnot yet fully, achieved at this time τreg .\nThe last two stages describe a standard relaxation process for which the tested system S is no longer relevant.\nThe stochastic motion of m is first governed mainly by the contribution of B to the drift of the magnetization m. The\nτreg =\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n126\n\ndistribution P↑↑ (m, t) moves rapidly towards +mF , first widening, then narrowing. We term as second registration time\nτ0reg the delay needed for the average magnetization to go from 0 to the vicinity of mF . It is expressed by Eq. (7.48),\ntogether with (7.47) and (7.36). During the third stage of the registration, both the drift and the diffusion generated\nby B establish thermal equilibrium of the pointer in an exponential process, and stabilize the distribution P↑↑ (m, t)\naround +mF . Thus, R̂↑↑ (t) ends up as r↑↑ (0)R̂⇑ , where R̂⇑ denotes the ferromagnetic equilibrium state with positive\nmagnetization, and, likewise, R̂↓↓ (t) ends up as r↓↓ (0)R̂⇓ .\nFor purely quartic interactions within M (coupling as J m̂4 ), or for 3J4 > J2 , the transition is of first order. We can\nagain distinguish in the registration the above three stages (§ 7.2.4), illustrated by Figs 7.4 and 7.6. Here the first stage\nis slowed down by the need to pass through the bottleneck m ' mc given by (7.34). The widening of the distribution\nP↑↑ (m, t) is much larger than for quadratic interactions, because diffusion is effective during the large duration of the\nbottleneck stage. Both the first and the second registration times defined above are nearly equal here, and given by\n(7.51), that is,\ns\nr\nmc T\nT\n2\nπ~\n,\nmc '\n,\nh c ' T mc .\n(9.10)\nτreg =\nγT g − hc\n3J\n3\nThe last stage is again an exponential relaxation towards the ferromagnetic state +mF for\n√ P↑↑ (m, t).\nThe ratio τreg /τtrunc between the registration and truncation times, proportional to N/γ, is large for two reasons,\nthe weakness of γ and the large value of N. As usual in statistical mechanics, the coexistence of very different time\nscales is associated here with exact and approximate conservation laws, expressed by [ ŝz , Ĥ] = 0 and [m̂, Ĥ] =\n√\n[m̂, ĤMB ] ∝ γ, which is small because γ \u001c 1.\nIf N is finite, the registration is not permanent. However, the characteristic time of erasure τeras is much larger\nthan the registration time τreg by a factor behaving as an exponential of N (§ 7.3.5).\nThe time scales involved in this Curie–Weiss measurement process present some analogy with the relaxation\ntimes in nuclear magnetic resonance [204, 205]. The truncation, i. e., the disappearance of the transverse components\nh ŝ x i and h ŝy i and of their correlations with A, can be compared to the transverse relaxation in nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR). The truncation time τtrunc , as well as is the relaxation time T2∗ associated in NMR with a dispersion\nin the precession frequencies of the spins of a sample due to a non-uniformity of the field along z, are durations of\ndephasing processes in which complex exponentials interfere destructively. By themselves, these phenomena give rise\nto recurrences (in our model of measurement) or to spin echoes (in NMR). The bath-induced irreversibility time τBirrev\nis comparable to the relaxation time T2 : both characterize decoherence effects, namely the damping of recurrences\nin the measurement, and the complete transverse relaxation which damps the echoes in NMR. Finally the registration\ntime characterizes the equilibration of the diagonal blocks of the density matrix D̂, in the same way as the relaxation\ntime T1 characterizes the equilibration of the longitudinal polarization of the spins submitted to the field along z.\n9.3.4. Reduction\nThe stages of the measurement process described in §§ 9.3.1–9.3.3 are related to the evolution of the density\noperator D̂(t) describing the statistics of the observables of S + A for the full ensemble E of runs. Consideration of\nindividual runs requires a study of the dynamics for arbitrary subensembles Esub of E. This study will be achieved in\nsection 11, where we will show that a last stage is required, near the end of the scenario (table 1). The model will then\nbe supplemented with a weak interaction within the apparatus, which produce transitions conserving m between the\nstates of the pointer M. These interactions have a size ∆, and the duration of the relaxation of the subensembles towards\nequilibrium is characterized by the very short time scale τsub = ~/∆ (Eq 11.17), much shorter than the registration\ntime.\nThe above summary exhibits the different roles played by the various coupling constants. On the one hand,\ntruncation is ensured entirely by the coupling g between S and M. Moreover, the beginning of the registration is also\ngoverned by g, which selects one of the alternative ferromagnetic states and which should therefore be sufficiently\nlarge. On the other hand, the coupling γ between M and B governs the registration, since the relaxation of M towards\nferromagnetic equilibrium requires a dumping of energy in the bath. Finally, the weak interaction ∆ within A governs\nthe subensemble relaxation, which ensures the uniqueness of the outcome of each run and allows reduction.\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n127\n\n9.4. Conditions for ideality of the measurement\nWhat you do not wish for yourself,\ndo not do to others\nConfucius\nStrictly speaking, for finite values of the parameters of the model, the process that we have studied cannot be an\nideal measurement in a mathematical sense. However, in a physical sense, the situation is comparable to the solution\nof the irreversibility paradox, which is found by disregarding correlations between inaccessibly large numbers of\nparticles and by focusing on time scales short compared to the inaccessible Poincaré recurrence time. Here (after\nhaving achieved the solution in section 11) we will likewise identify physically the process with an ideal measurement,\nwithin negligible deviations, provided the parameters of the model satisfy some conditions.\nThe definition of the apparatus includes a macroscopic pointer, so that\nN \u001d 1.\n\n(9.11)\n\nThe temperature T of the bath B should lie below the transition temperature of the magnet M, which equals J for\nquadratic interactions (q = 2) and 0.363 J for purely quartic interactions (q = 4).\nOur solution was found by retaining only the lowest order in the coupling between B and M. Neglecting the higher\norder terms is justified provided\nT\n.\n(9.12)\nJ\nThis condition ensures that the autocorrelation time of the bath, ~/T , is short compared to the registration time (9.9)\nor (9.10). We have also assumed a large value for the Debye cutoff, a natural physical constraint expressed by\nγ\n\n~Γ \u001d J.\n\n(9.13)\n\nThe irreversibility of the truncation, if it is ensured by a dispersion δg of the couplings between tested spin and\napparatus spins, requires a neat separation of the time scales τtrunc \u001c τM\nirrev \u001c τrecur , that is\nδg\n1\nδ0\n\ng\nπ\n\nr\n\n2\n.\nN\n\n(9.14)\n\n√\nThe coefficient δ0 , the width of the initial paramagnetic distribution of m N, is somewhat larger than 1 for q = 2\n(quadratic Ising interactions, Eq. (3.52) and equal to 1 for q = 4 (quartic interactions) or when using a strong RF field\nto initialize the magnet, so that the condition (9.14) is readily satisfied.\nIf the irreversibility of the truncation is ensured by the bath, we should have NB(τrecur ) = τrecur /τBirrev \u001d 1, that is\n4\ng\ntanh .\n(9.15)\nπN\nT\nThis condition provides a lower bound on the bath-magnet coupling. An upper bound is also provided by (9.7) if we\nwish the initial truncation to be controlled by M only. Both bounds are easily satisfied for N \u001d 1.\nThe coupling g between S and M has been assumed to be rather weak,\nγ\n\ng < T.\n\n(9.16)\n\nHowever, this coupling should be sufficiently strong to initiate the registration, and to ensure that the final indication\nof the pointer after decoupling will be +mF if S lies initially in the state |↑i, −mF if it lies initially in the state |↓i. For\nq = 2, this condition is not very stringent. We have seen in § 7.2.2 that it is expressed by (7.41), namely\ng\n\n(J − T )δ1\n,\n√\nN\n\nδ21 = δ20 +\n\nT\nT0\nT\n=\n+\n.\nJ−T\nT0 − J J − T\n\n(9.17)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n128\n\nFor purely quartic interactions − 14 J m̂4 (or for 3J4 > J2 ) the paramagnetic state is locally stable in the absence of\ninteraction with S. The coupling g should therefore be larger than some threshold, finite for large N,\nr\ng > hc '\n\n4T 3\n,\n27J\n\n(9.18)\n\nso as to trigger the phase transition from m = 0 to m = ± mF during the delay (9.10). Moreover, if we wish the\ndecoupling between S and A to take place before the magnet has reached ferromagnetic equilibrium, g must lie\nsufficiently above hc (see Eq. (7.57)).\nIf all the above conditions are satisfied, the final state reached by S + A for the full set of runs of the measurement is\nphysically indistinguishable from the surmise (9.1), which encompasses necessary properties of ideal measurements,\nto wit, truncation and unbiased registration, that is, full correlation between the indication of the apparatus and the\nfinal state of the tested system. However, these properties are not sufficient to ensure the uniqueness of the outcome\nof individual runs (section 11).\n9.5. Processes differing from ideal measurements\nIn de beperking toont zich de meester90\nLe mieux est l’ennemi du bien91\nDutch and French sayings\nViolations of some among the conditions of subsection 9.4 or modifications of the model allow us to get a better\ninsight on quantum measurements, by evaluating deviations from ideality and exploring processes which fail to be\nmeasurements, but are still respectable evolutions of coupled quantum mechanical systems.\nIn subsection 5.2, we modify the initial state of the apparatus, assuming that it is not prepared in an equilibrium\nparamagnetic state. This discussion leads us to understand truncation as a consequence of the disordered nature of\nthe initial state of M, whether or not this state is pure (§ 5.2.2). For “squeezed” initial states, the rapid truncation\nmechanism can even fail (§ 5.2.3).\nImperfect preparation may also produce another kind of failure. In § 7.3.3 we consider a bias in the initial state\ndue to the presence during the preparation stage of a parasite magnetic field which produces a paramagnetic state with\nnon-zero average magnetization. Wrong registrations, for which M reaches for instance a negative magnetization −mF\nin the final state although it is coupled to a tested spin in the state sz = +1, may then occur with a probability expressed\nby (7.79).\nSection 6 shows that recurrences are not washed out if the conditions Eq. (9.14) or (9.15) are not fulfilled. The\n2\nB\nprobability for the p-th recurrence to occur is exp[−(pτrecur /τM\nirrev ) ] in the first case, exp(−pτrecur /τirrev ) in the second\ncase. The process is not an ideal measurement if recurrences are still present when the outcome is read.\nThe violation of the condition (9.17) for q = 2 or (9.18) for q = 4 prevents the registration from taking place\nproperly. For q = 2, if the coupling g is too weak to satisfy (9.17), the apparatus does relax towards either one of the\nferromagnetic states ±mF , but it may provide a false indication. The probability for getting wrongly −mF for an initial\nstate |↑i of S, evaluated in § 7.3.3, is given by (7.79). For q = 4, the registration is aborted if (9.18) is violated: the\nmagnet M does not leave the paramagnetic region, and its magnetization returns to 0 when the coupling is switched\noff.\nThe large number N of elements of the pointer M is essential to ensure a faithful and long-lasting registration for\neach individual run. It also warrants a brief truncation time, and an efficient suppression of recurrences by the bath.\nWe study in subsection 8.1 the extreme situation with N = 2, for which m̂ has only two “paramagnetic” eigenstates\nwith m = 0 and two “ferromagnetic” eigenstates with m = ±1. Although correlations can be established at the time\n(8.20) between the initial state of S and the magnet M in agreement with Born’s rule, there is no true registration.\nThe indication of M reached at that time is lost after a delay τobs expressed by (8.15); moreover, a macroscopic extra\napparatus is needed to observe M itself during this delay. On the other hand, the truncation process, governed here by\n90 Conciseness exposes the master\n91 Best is the enemy of good\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n129\n\nthe bath, is more akin to equilibration than to decoherence; it has an anomalously long characteristic time, longer than\nthe registration time. These non-idealities of the model with N = 2 are discussed in § 8.1.5. However, such a device\nmight be used (§ 8.1.6) to implement the idea of determining all four elements of the density matrix of S by means of\nrepeated experiments using a single apparatus [279, 280, 281].\nIn subsection 8.2 we tackle the situation in which the measured observable ŝz is not conserved during the evolution.\nAn ideal measurement is still feasible under the condition (8.71), but it fails if S and A are not decoupled after some\ndelay (§ 8.2.5).\nThe model can also be extended (subsection 8.3) by simultaneously coupling S with two apparatuses A and\nA0 which, taken separately, would measure ŝz and ŝ x , respectively. The simultaneous measurement of such noncommuting observables is of course impossible. However, here again, repeated runs can provide full information on\nthe statistics of both ŝz and ŝ x in the initial state r̂(0) (§ 8.3.3). More generally, all the elements of the density matrix\nr̂(0) characterizing an ensemble of identically prepared spins S can be determined by repeated experiments involving\na compound apparatus A+A0 +A00 , where A, A0 and A00 are simultaneously coupled to the observables ŝ x , ŝy and ŝz ,\nrespectively. Indirect tests of Bell’s inequalities may rely on this idea (§ 8.3.4).\n9.6. Pedagogical hints\nThe path is made by walking\nLe mouvement se prouve en marchant\nAfrican and French proverbs\nModels of quantum measurements give rise to many exercises of tutorial interest, which help the students to better\ngrasp quantum (statistical) mechanics. We have encountered above several questions which may inspire teachers. The\nexercises that they suggest require the use of density operators. As quantum mechanics is often taught only in the\nlanguage of pure states, we present in appendix G an introduction for students on this topic.\nFor instance, the treatment of a thermal bath at lowest order in its coupling with the rest of the system (subsection\n4.2 and Appendix A), although standard, deserves to be worked out by advanced students.\nFor a general class of models of measurement involving a pointer with many degrees of freedom, the truncation\nmechanism exhibited in § 5.1.2 shows how dephasing can eliminate the off-diagonal blocks of the density matrix of S\n+ A over a short time through interferences.\nThe evaluation of the recurrence time for the pointer coupled with the tested system, or more generally for an\narbitrary quantum system (or for a linear dynamical system) having a random spectrum (§ 6.1.2 and Appendix C) is\nalso of general interest.\nWe now give two further examples of exercises for students which highlight the central steps of the quantum\nmeasurement.\n9.6.1. End of “Schrödinger cats”\nFocusing on the Curie-Weiss model, we present here a simpler derivation of the processes which first lead to truncation and which prevent recurrences from occurring. We showed in section 6 and Appendix D that the interactions\nJ2 and J4 between the spins σ̂(n) of M play little role here, so that we neglect them. We further assume that M lies\ninitially in the most disordered state (3.47), that we write out, using the notation (3.1), as\nR̂M (0) =\n\n1 (1)\n(N)\nσ̂ ⊗ σ̂(2)\n0 ⊗ · · · ⊗ σ̂0 .\n2N 0\n\n(9.19)\n\nThis occurs for q = 4 and in the general case of J2 > 0 provided the temperature of preparation T 0 in (3.52) is much\nhigher than J2 , so that δ0 = 1. Then, since the Hamiltonian ĤSA + ĤB + ĤMB is a sum of independent contributions\nassociated with each spin σ̂(n) , the spins of M behave independently at all times, and the off-diagonal block R̂↑↓ (t) of\nD̂(t) has the form\nR̂↑↓ (t) = r↑↓ (0) ρ̂(1) (t) ⊗ ρ̂(2) (t) ⊗ · · · ⊗ ρ̂(N) (t),\n(9.20)\n(n)\nwhere ρ̂(n) (t) is a 2 × 2 matrix in the Hilbert space of the spin σ̂(n) . This matrix will depend on σ̂(n)\nz but not on σ̂ x and\n(n)\nσ̂y , and it will neither be hermitean nor normalized.\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n130\n\nThe task starts with keeping the effect of the bath as in subsection 6.2, but leaves open the possibility for the\nPN\ncoupling gn to be random as in subsection 6.1, whence the coupling between S and A reads ĤSA = − ŝz n=1\ngn σ̂(n)\nz\ninstead of (3.5). (As simpler preliminary exercises, one may keep the gn = g as constant, and/or disregard the bath.)\nEach factor ρ̂(n) (t), initially equal to 12 σ̂(n)\n0 , evolves according to the same equation as (4.8) for R̂↑↓ (t), rewritten with\nN = 1. (To convince oneself of the product structure (9.20), it is instructive to work out the cases N = 1 and N = 2\nin Eq. (4.8) or (4.18).)

By increasing\nN, e.g., N = 1, 2, 10, 100, he/she can convince him/herself that the decay near t = 0 becomes close to a Gaussian\ndecay, over the characteristic time τtrunc of Eq. (9.4). The student may demonstrate this analytically by setting\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n131\n\ncos 2gn t/~ ≈ exp(−2g2n t2 /~2 ) for small t. This time characterizes decoherence, that is, disappearance of the offdiagonal blocks of the density matrix; we called it “truncation time” rather than “decoherence time” to distinguish it\nfrom usual decoherence, which is induced by a thermal environment and coded in the second factor of Evol(t).\nThe exercise continues with the aim to show that |Evol| \u001c 1 at t = τrecur in order that the model describes a faithful\nquantum measurement. To this aim, keeping γ = 0, the student can in the first factor of Evol decompose gn = g + δgn ,\nwhere δgn is a small Gaussian random variable with hδgn i = 0 and hδg2n i ≡ δg2 \u001c g2 , and average over the δgn . The\nGaussian decay (6.10) will thereby be recovered, which already prevents recurrences. The student may also take e.g.\nN = 10 or 100, and plot the function to show this decay and to estimate the size of Evol at later times.\nNext by taking γ > 0 the effect of the bath in (9.27) can be analyzed. For values γ such that γN \u001d 1 the bath will\nlead to a suppression. Several further tasks can be given now: Take all gn equal and plot the function Evol(t); take\na small spread in them and compare the results; make the small-gn approximation gn coth gn /T ≈ T , and compare\nagain.\nAt least one of the two effects (spread in the couplings or suppression by the bath) should be strong enough to\nprevent recurrences, that is, to make |r↑↓ (t)| \u001c |r↑↓ (0)| at any time t \u001d τtrunc , including the recurrence times. The\nstudent can recover the conditions (9.14) or (9.15) under which the two mechanisms achieve to do so. The above\nstudy will show him/her that, in the dynamical process for which each spin σ̂(n) of M independently rotates and is\ndamped by the bath, the truncation, which destroys the expectation values h ŝa i and all correlations h ŝa m̂k (t)i (a = x or\ny, k ≥ 1), arises from the precession of the tested spin ŝ around the z-axis; this is caused by the conjugate effect of the\nmany spins σ̂(n) of M, while the suppression of recurrences is either due to dephasing if the gn are non-identical, or\ndue to damping by the bath.\nA less heavy exercise is to derive (5.27) from (5.26); hereto the student first calculates hmi and then hm2 i. Many\nother exercises may be inspired by sections 5 and 6, including the establishment and disappearance of the off-diagonal\nspin-magnet correlations (§ 5.1.3); the numerical or analytical derivation of the damping function B(t) (Appendix D);\nits short-time behavior obtained either as for (D.9) or from the first two terms of the short-time expansion of K(t);\nthe analytical study of the autocorrelation functions K(t), K>t and K<t of the bath for different time scales using the\ncomplex plane technique of Appendix D.\n9.6.2. Simplified description of the registration process\nWe have seen in § 7.1.2 that the registration process looks, for the diagonal block R↑↑ (t), as a classical relaxation of\nthe magnet M towards the stable state with magnetization +mF under the effect of the coupling g which behaves in this\nsector as a positive field. This idea can be used to describe the registration by means of the classical Fokker-Planck\nequation (7.1) which governs the evolution of the probability distribution P(m, t) = P↑↑ (m, t)/r↑↑ (0).\nBy assuming explicit expressions for the drift and the diffusion coefficient which enter this equation of motion,\none can recover some of the results of section 7 in a form adapted to teaching.\nIn particular, if we keep aside the shape and the width of the probability distribution, which has a narrow peak for\nlarge N (§ 7.2.1), the center μ(t) of this peak moves according to the mean-field equation\ndμ(t)\n= v[μ(t)],\ndt\n\n(9.28)\n\nwhere v(m) is the local drift velocity of the flow of m., This equation can be solved once v(m) is given, and its general\nproperties do not depend on the precise form of v(m). The first choice is phenomenological: we take v(m) proportional\nto −dF/dm, where F is the free energy (3.55), resulting in\n!\nC(m)\nT 1+m\nq−1\nv(m) =\nJm + g − ln\n,\n~\n2 1−m\n\n(9.29)\n\nwith a dimensionless, positive function C(m) which may depend smoothly on m in various ways (§ 7.1.2), or even be\napproximated as a constant. An alternative phenomenological choice consists in deriving from detailed balance, as in\n§ 7.1.2, the expression (7.14) for v(m), that is, within a multiplicative factor θ(m),\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n132\n\n!\ng + Jmq−1\n1\ntanh\n−m .\n(9.30)\nθ(m)\nT\npossibly approximating θ as a constant.

Comparison between quadratic\ninteractions (q = 2) and quartic interactions (q = 4) is instructive. The student can determine in the latter case the\nminimum value of the coupling g below which the registration cannot take place, and convince him/herself that it\ndoes not depend on the form of C(m). Approaching this threshold from above, one observes the slowing down of the\nprocess around the crossing of the bottleneck. This feature is made obvious by comparing the Figs 7.3 and 7.4 which\nillustrate the two situations q = 2 and q = 4, respectively, and which were evaluated by using the form (9.30)) of v(m).\nThe above exercise overlooks the broadening and subsequent narrowing of the profile at intermediate times, which\nis relevant for finite values of N. More advanced students may be proposed to numerically solve the time evolution of\nP(m, t), i. e., the whole registration process, at finite N, taking in the rate equations Eq.

The relevant rate coefficients are listed at the end of Appendix B.\n10. Statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics\nA man should first direct himself in the way he should go.\nOnly then should he instruct others\nBuddha\nMeasurements constitute privileged tools for relating experimental reality and quantum theory. The solution of\nmodels of quantum measurements is therefore expected to enlighten the foundations of quantum mechanics, in the\nsame way as the elucidation of the paradoxes of classical statistical mechanics has provided a deeper understanding of the Second Law of thermodynamics, either through an interpretation of entropy as missing information at the\nmicroscopic scale [57, 58, 74, 73, 81, 71, 289, 290], or through a microscopic interpretation of the work and heat\nconcepts [72, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298]. In fact, the whole literature devoted to the quantum measurement problem has as a background the interpretation of quantum mechanics. Conversely, some specific formulation\nof the principles and some interpretation are needed to understand the meaning of calculations about models. The use\nof quantum statistical mechanics (sections 2 and 9) provides us with a density operator of the form (9.1) at the final\ntime; before drawing physical conclusions (section 11) we have to make clear what such a technical tool really means.\nWe prefer, among the various interpretations of quantum mechanics [31, 34, 36, 299], the statistical one which we\nestimate the most adequate. We review below the main features of this statistical interpretation, as underlined by Park\n[28] and supported by other authors. It is akin to the one advocated by Ballentine [9, 48], but it does not coincide with\nthe latter in all aspects. For a related historic perspective, see Plotnitsky [300].\n10.1. Principles\nIn its statistical interpretation (also called ensemble interpretation), quantum mechanics presents some conceptual\nanalogy with statistical mechanics. It has a dualistic nature, involving two types of mathematical objects, associated with a system and with possible predictions about it, respectively. On the one hand, the “observables”, noncommutative random operators, describe the physical quantities related to the studied system. On the other hand, a\n“state” of this system, represented by a density operator, gathers the whole probabilistic information available about\nit under given circumstances.\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n133\n\n10.1.1. Physical quantities: observables\nHello, Dolly!\nIt’s so nice to have you back where you belong\nWritten by Jerry Herman, sung by Louis Armstrong\nIn classical physics, the physical quantities are represented by c-numbers, that is, scalar commuting variables,\npossibly random in stochastic dynamics or in classical statistical mechanics. In quantum physics, the situation is\ndifferent. The physical quantities cannot be directly observed or manipulated; hence we refrain from the idea that they\nmight take well-defined scalar values. The microscopic description of a system requires counterintuitive concepts,\nwhich nevertheless have a precise mathematical representation, and which will eventually turn out to fit experiments.\nThe physical quantities that we are considering are, for instance, the position, the momentum, or the components of\nthe spin of each particle constituting the considered system, or a field at any point. The mathematical tools accounting\nfor such quantities in unspecified circumstances have a random nature. Termed as “observables”, they are elements of\nsome algebra which depends on the specific system. One should not be misled by the possibly subjective connotation\nof the term “observable”: the “observables” of quantum mechanics pertain only to the system, and do not refer to any\nexternal observer or measuring device. Along the lines of Heisenberg’s matrix theory [10, 11, 31, 34, 36, 48, 85, 299],\nthey can be represented as linear operators acting in a complex Hilbert space H, or as matrices once a basis is chosen\nin this space, which exhibits the algebraic structure.\nThe present more abstract approach is also more general, as it encompasses other representations, termed as\nLiouville representations [75, 301, 302] in which the product is implemented differently; an example of these, the\nWigner representation, is useful in the semi-classical limit. The structure of the set of observables, a C ∗ -algebra [156],\ninvolves addition, multiplication by complex c-numbers, hermitean conjugation, and non-commutative product92 .\nThe physical observables Ô are hermitean. They play in quantum mechanics the same rôle as random variables\nin classical statistical mechanics, except for the essential fact that they belong to a non-commutative algebra, the\nstructure of which fully characterizes the system [156]. Ordinary reasoning and macroscopic experience do not help\nus to develop intuition about such non-commuting physical quantities, and this is the main incentive for proposals of\nalternative interpretations of quantum mechanics [17, 19, 214, 216, 217, 303].\nIn some circumstances, when the observables of interest constitute a commutative subset, the peculiar aspects of\nquantum mechanics that raise difficulties of interpretation do not appear [156, 115, 116]. For instance, the classical\nprobability theory is sufficient for working out the statistical mechanics of non-interacting Fermi or Bose gases at thermal equilibrium. This simplification occurs because we deal there only with commuting observables, the occupation\nnumber operators n̂k for the single particle states |ki, which can be treated as random c-numbers taking the discrete\nvalues nk = 0 or 1 for fermions, nk = 0, 1, 2, · · · for bosons. However, even in this simple case, it is the underlying\nnon-commutative algebra of the creation and annihilation operators â†k and âk which explains why the eigenvalues of\nn̂k = â†k âk are those integers. A similar situation occurs for macroscopic systems, for which classical behaviors emerge\nfrom the hidden microscopic fundamental quantum theory. The variables controlled in practice then commute, at least\napproximately, so that classical concepts are sufficient. Macroscopic properties such as electronic conduction versus\ninsulation, magnetism, heat capacities, superfluidity, or the very existence of crystals all have a quantum origin but\nobey equations of a “classical” type, in the sense that they involve only commutative variables. Non commutation, the\nessence of quantum mechanics, may manifest itself only exceptionally in systems that are not microscopic, see [304]\nand references therein.\nWhat one calls “quantum” and “classical” depends, though, on which quantities are observed and how the difference with respect to their classical limit is quantified (if such a limit exists at all). We have identified above a\n“truly quantum” behavior with non-commutativity, a deep but restrictive definition. Other viewpoints are currently\nexpressed, such as dependence on ~. Quantum electrodynamics have two classical limits, wave-like when the noncommutation of the electric and magnetic fields is not effective, and particle-like when the number of photons is well\ndefined. Moreover, the quantal or classical nature of a given concept may depend on the specific situation. The cen92 In mathematical terms, a C ∗ -algebra is defined as a closed associative algebra, including an involution x ↔ x∗ (with (xy)∗ = y∗ x∗ ) and a norm\n(with ||x + y|| ≤ ||x|| + ||y|| and ||xy|| ≤ ||x|| ||y||) which satisfies the identity ||x∗ x|| = ||x||2 = ||x∗ ||2 . In quantum mechanics or quantum field theory, we\ndeal with a C ∗ -algebra over complex numbers including unity; an observable is a self-adjoint element of C ∗ and a state is a positive linear functional\non C ∗\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n134\n\nter of mass of a small metallic grain can be described by its “classical” value, while the shape of its heat capacity\nrequires a quantum description, such as the Debye model although the concept of specific heat, its measurement, its\nthermodynamic aspects, are all “pre-quantal”. On the other hand, in atomic clocks one needs to control the quantum\nfluctuations of the position of the center of mass, which is therefore not so classical. An extreme case of quantal center\nof mass is a mechanical resonator in its ground state or excited by one phonon [305].\n10.1.2. Dynamics\nDynamics is currently implemented in the quantum theory through the Schrödinger picture, where the observables\nremain constant while the states (pure or mixed) evolve according to the Schrödinger or the Liouville-von Neumann\nequation. Following the tradition, we have relied on this procedure in sections 4 to 8, and will still use it in section 11.\nThe evolution then bears on the wave function or the density operator, objects which characterize our information on\nthe system. However, dynamics should be regarded as a property of the system itself, regardless of its observers. It is\ntherefore conceptually enlightening to account for the evolution of an isolated system in the Heisenberg picture, as a\nchange in time of its observables which pertain to this system.\nWe should then implement the dynamics as a transformation of the set of observables, represented by a linear\nmapping that leaves invariant the algebraic relations between the whole set of observables [10, 11, 31, 34, 36, 48, 85].\nIn the Hilbert space representation, this implies that the transformation is unitary. (In Liouville representations,\nwhere observables behave as vectors, their evolution is generated by the Liouvillian superoperator.) Denoting by t0\nthe reference time at which the observables Ô are defined, we can thus write the observables Ô(t, t0 ) at the running\ntime t as Ô(t, t0 ) = Û † (t, t0 )ÔÛ(t, t0 ), where the unitary transformation Û(t, t0 ) carries the set of observables from t0\nto t. (In the Schrödinger picture, it is the density operator which depends on time, according to Û(t, t0 )D̂Û † (t, t0 ).)\nThe infinitesimal generator of this transformation being the Hamiltonian Ĥ, the time-dependent observable Ô(t, t0 )\nis characterized either by the usual Heisenberg equation i~∂Ô(t, t0 )/∂t = [Ô(t, t0 ), Ĥ] with the boundary condition\nÔ(t0 , t0 ) = Ô or by the backward equation i~∂Ô(t, t0 )/∂t0 = [Ĥ, Ô(t, t0 )] with the boundary condition Ô(t, t) = Ô.\nThe backward equation, more general as it also holds if Ĥ or Ô depend explicitly on time, is efficient for producing\ndynamical approximations, in particular for correlation functions [306]. The interest of the backward viewpoint for\nthe registration in a measurement is exhibited in § 7.3.1, Appendix F and § 13.1.3.\nNote that the observables and their evolution in the Heisenberg picture can be regarded as non commutative, onetime random objects that may be ascribed to a single system. We do not speak yet of information available about these\ntime-dependent observables in some specific circumstance. This will require the introduction of statistical ensembles\nof similarly prepared systems (§ 10.1.3) and of “states” that encompass the information and from which probabilistic\npredictions about measurements can be derived (§ 10.1.4).\nThe Heisenberg picture thus defines time-dependent algebraic structures that are dynamically invariant [156]. For\ninstance, the x − p commutation relation acquires a definite kinematical status, irrespective of the statistics of these\nphysical quantities. Whereas the Schrödinger picture tangles the deterministic and probabilistic aspects of quantum\nmechanics within the time-dependent states |ψ(t)i or D̂(t), these two aspects are well separated in the Heisenberg\npicture, deterministic dynamics of the observables, probabilistic nature of the time-independent states. We will rely\non this remark in subsection 13.1. The Heisenberg picture also allows to define correlations of observables taken\nat different times and pertaining to the same system [299, 306]. Such autocorrelations, as the Green’s functions in\nfield theory, contain detailed information about the dynamical probabilistic behavior of the systems of the considered\nensemble, but cannot be directly observed through ideal measurements.\n10.1.3. Interpretation of probabilities and statistical ensembles of systems\nWhat is true is no more sure than the probable\nGreek proverb\nWhile the observables and their evolution appear as properties of the objects under study, our knowledge about\nthem is probabilistic. The statistical interpretation highlights the fact that quantum mechanics provides us only with\nprobabilities [9, 10, 11, 28, 29, 31, 52, 58]. Although a probabilistic theory may produce some predictions with certainty, most quantities that we deal with at the microscopic scale are subject to statistical fluctuations: expectation\nvalues, correlations at a given time, or autocorrelations at different times when we observe for instance the successive transitions of a trapped ion [307, 308]. Exact properties of individual systems can be found only in special\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n135\n\ncircumstances, such as the ideal measurement of some observable (section 11). Thus, explicitly or implicitly, our\ndescriptions refer to statistical ensembles of systems and to repeated experiments [9, 28, 31]. Even when we describe\na single object we should imagine that it belongs to a thought ensemble E [299], all elements of which are considered\nto be prepared under similar conditions characterized by the same set of data93 . Notice the similarity with ensemble\ntheory in classical statistical physics, which also allows probabilistic predictions on single systems [55, 56]. However,\nthere is no quantum system devoid of any statistical fluctuations [9, 31]. Individual events resulting from the same\npreparation are in general not identical but obey some probability law, even when the preparation is as complete as\npossible.\nThe concept of probability, inherent to quantum mechanics, is subject to several interpretations, two of which are\ncurrently used in physics94 . On the one hand, in the “frequentist” interpretation, a probability is identified with the\nrelative frequency of occurrence of a given event. This conception of probabilities, the current one in the XVIIth and\nXVIIIth centuries, has been given a mathematical foundation, on which we will return in § 11.2.2, by Venn [309] and\nvon Mises [310]. On the other hand, in the “logical Bayesian” approach, initiated by Bayes and Laplace, and later\non formalized by Cox [311] and advocated by Jaynes [289], probabilities are defined as a mathematical measure\nof likelihood of events; they are not inherent to the considered object alone, but are tools for making reasonable\npredictions about this object through consistent inference95 . Both interpretations are relevant to quantum theory, and\ntheir equivalence has been established [313], in the context of assigning a quantum probability distribution to a system\n(§ 10.2.2). In fact, understanding the conceptual quantum issues (including measurement) does not demand that one\nadheres to one rather than to the other. Possible mistakes committed in discussing these issues should not be assigned\nto a specific (Bayesian or frequency) interpretation of probability [314, 315].\nDepending on the circumstances, one of these interpretations may look more natural than the other. In measurement theory, Born’s probabilities pi can be regarded as relative frequencies, since pi is identified, for a large set E of\nruns, with the relative number of runs having produced the outcome Ai of the pointer. We will rely on the same idea\nin section 11, where we consider arbitrary subensembles of E: For a given subensemble, the weight qi associated with\neach outcome Ai will then be interpreted as a probability in the sense of a proportion of runs of each type. On the other\nhand, according to its definition in § 10.1.4, the concept of quantum state has a Bayesian aspect. In this approach, the\nprior needed for assigning a state to a system in given circumstances is provided by unitary invariance (§ 10.2.2). A\nstate does not pertain to a system in itself, but characterizes our information on it or on the ensemble to which it belongs. In fact, information has turned out to be a central concept in statistical physics [57, 58, 74, 73, 81, 71, 289, 290].\nThis idea is exemplified by spin-echo experiments [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 204, 205]. After the initial relaxation, an\nobserver not aware of the history of the system cannot describe its spins better than by means of a completely random\nprobability distribution. However, the experimentalist, who is able to manipulate the sample so as to let the original\nmagnetization revive, includes in his probabilistic description the hidden correlations that keep track of the ordering\nof the initial state. Likewise, we can assign different probabilities to the content of a coded message that we have\nintercepted, depending on our knowledge about the coding [74]. Since quantum theory is irreducibly probabilistic, it\nhas thus a partly subjective nature — or rather “inter-subjective” since under similar conditions all observers, using\nthe same knowledge, will describe a quantum system in the same way and will make the same probabilistic predictions about it. The recent developments about the use of quantum systems as information processors [42] enforce this\ninformation-based interpretation [88, 316] (see the end of § 12.4.2).\nIt is important to note that, depending on the available information, a given system may be embedded in different\nstatistical ensembles, and hence may be described by different probability distributions. This occurs both in classical\nprobability theory and in quantum physics. Such a distinction between an ensemble and one of its subensembles, both\n93 When accounting probabilistically for the cosmic microwave spectrum, one imagines the Universe to belong to an ensemble of possible\nuniverses. With a single Universe at hand, this leads to the unsolvable cosmic variance problem. The same ideas hold whenever probabilities are\napplied to a single system or event [311], and this is the subject of standard and thorough developments in books of probabilities, including already\nLaplace’s\n94 Kolmogorov’s axioms, the starting point of many mathematical treatises, do not prejudge how probabilities may be interpreted in applications\n95 We keep aside the “subjective Bayesian” interpretation, developed by de Finetti [312], and suited more to ordinary life or economy than to\nscience. There, probabilities are associated with the state of mind of an agent, and help him to take rational decisions. Prior probabilities reflect\ntheir subjectivity, whereas priors are provided by a physical invariance in quantum mechanics (unitary invariance in Hilbert space) or in statistical\nmechanics (invariance under canonical transformations in phase space), so that the entropy is then defined uniquely\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n136\n\ncontaining the considered system, will turn out to be essential in measurements (§ 11.1.2). There, a single run may\nbe regarded as an event chosen among all possible runs issued from the initial state D̂(0) of S + A, but may also be\nregarded as belonging to some subset of runs – in particular the subset that will be tagged after achievement of the\nprocess by some specific indication of the pointer (§ 11.3.2). The study of the dynamics of subensembles (subsection\n11.2) will therefore be a crucial issue in the understanding of reduction in measurements.\n10.1.4. States\nL’Etat c’est moi96\nLouis XIV\nIn the present scope, the definition of a quantum state is conceptually the same as in statistical mechanics [123,\n73, 28]: A state of the considered system (or more precisely a state of the real or virtual statistical ensemble E (or\nsubensemble) of systems to which it belongs) is characterized by specifying the correspondence Ô 7→ hÔi between\nthe elements Ô of the C ∗ -algebra of observables and c-numbers hÔi. This correspondence has the following properties\n[52, 58]: it is linear, it associates a real number to hermitean operators, a non-negative number to the square of an\nobservable, and the number 1 to the unit operator. Such properties entail in particular that hÔ2 i − hÔi2 cannot be\nnegative.\nThe c-number hÔi associated through the above mathematical definition with the observable Ô will eventually\nbe interpreted as the expectation value of the physical quantity represented by Ô, and this interpretation will emerge\nfrom the ideal measurement process of Ô (§ 11.3.1). Accordingly, hÔ2 i − hÔi2 appears as the variance of Ô; likewise,\nthe probability of finding for Ô some eigenvalue Oi is the expectation value hΠ̂i i of the projection operator Π̂i over\nthe corresponding eigenspace of Oi . A quantum state has thus a probabilistic nature, as it is identified with the\ncollection of expectation values of all the observables. However, if two observables Ô1 and Ô2 do not commute and\nthus cannot be measured simultaneously, hÔ1 i and hÔ2 i, taken together, should not be regarded as expectation values\nin the ordinary sense of probability theory (§ 10.2.1).\nFor infinite systems or fields, this definition of a state as a mapping of the algebra of observables onto commuting\nc-numbers has given rise to mathematical developments in the theory of C ∗ -algebras [156]. Focusing on the vector\nspace structure of the set of observables, one then considers the states as elements of the dual vector space. For finite\nsystems the above properties are implemented in an elementary way once the observables are represented as operators\nin a Hilbert space. The mapping is represented by a density operator D̂ in this Hilbert space, which is hermitean,\nnon-negative and normalized, and which generates all the expectation values through [52, 58]\nÔ 7→ hÔi = trD̂Ô.\n\n(10.1)\n\nIn fact, according to Gleason’s theorem [50], the linearity of this correspondence for any pair of commuting observables is sufficient to ensure the existence of D̂. (We use the notation D̂ for the generic system considered here; no\nconfusion should arise with the state of S + A in the above sections.)\nA tutorial introduction to density operators is presented in Appendix G.\nA density operator which characterizes a state plays the rôle of a probability distribution for the non-commuting\nphysical quantities Ô since it gathers through (10.1) our whole information about an ensemble of quantum systems\n[28, 52, 58, 289]. As in probability theory, the amount of missing information associated with the state D̂ is measured\nby its von Neumann entropy [52, 58, 289].\nS (D̂) = −trD̂ ln D̂.\n\n(10.2)\n\nFor time-dependent predictions on an isolated system, Eq. (10.1) holds both in the Schrödinger picture, with\nfixed observables and the Liouville–von Neumann evolution for D̂(t), and in the Heisenberg picture, with fixed D̂\nand observables evolving unitarily. However, two-time (and multi-time) autocorrelation functions cannot be defined\nwithin the Schrödinger picture. They are obtained as tr D̂Ô1 (t1 , t0 )Ô2 (t2 , t0 ), where the observables in the Heisenberg\n96 The State, that’s me\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n137\n\npicture refer to the physical quantities of interest and their dynamics, and where the state accounts for our knowledge\nabout the system [156]. In particular, when defining in § 3.3.2 the autocorrelation function K(t − t0 ) of the bath, it was\nnecessary to express the time-dependent bath operators in the Heisenberg picture (although we eventually inserted\nK(t − t0 ) into the Liouville–von Neumann equations of motion of S + M in section 4 and appendix A).\nIn this interpretation, what we call the state “of a system”, whether it is pure or not, is not a property of the\nconsidered system in itself, but it characterizes the statistical properties of the real or virtual ensemble (or subensemble)\nto which this system belongs [28, 52, 58, 289]. The word “state” itself is also misleading, since we mean by it\nthe summary of our knowledge about the ensemble, from which we wish to make probabilistic predictions. The\nconventional expression “the state of the system” is therefore doubly improper in quantum physics, especially within\nthe statistical interpretation [28, 52, 58], and we should not be misled by this wording — although we cannot help to\nuse it when teaching.\nDensity operators differ from distributions of the probability theory taught in mathematical courses and from densities in phase space of classical statistical mechanics, because the quantum physical quantities have a non-commutative\nnature [10, 11, 31, 34, 36, 48, 52, 58, 85, 299]. This algebraic feature, compelled by experiments in microphysics, lies\nat the origin of the odd properties which make quantum mechanics counterintuitive. It implies quantization. It also\nimplies the superposition principle, which is embedded in the matrix nature of D̂. It entails Heisenberg’s inequality\n∆Ô∆Ô0 ≥ 12 |h[Ô, Ô0 ]i| and hence Bohr’s complementarity: since the product of the variances of two non-commuting\nobservables has a lower bound, it is only in a fuzzy way that we can think simultaneously of quantities such as the\nposition and the momentum (or the wavelength) of a particle, contrary to what would happen in classical statistical\nmechanics. Thus the non-commutation of observables implies the existence of intrinsic fluctuations, and the quantum\ntheory is irreducibly probabilistic [10, 11, 28, 31, 34, 36, 48, 85, 299].\nOne should note, however, that the non-commutation of two observables does not necessarily imply that they\npresent quantum fluctuations. For instance, if two operators do not commute, there may exist states (their common\neigenstates) in which both have well-defined values. As an example, in states with orbital momentum zero, the\ncomponents L̂ x and L̂y vanish without any statistical fluctuation. (This does not contradict the Heisenberg inequality\n∆L̂ x ∆L̂y ≥ 21 ~|hL̂z i|, because both sides vanish in this case; more general uncertainty relations for orbital momentum\nare given in [317].) Conversely, two commuting observables may fluctuate in some states, even pure ones.\nIn the statistical interpretation, we should refrain from imagining that the observables might take well-defined\nbut undetectable values in a given state, and that the uncertainties about them might be a mere result of incomplete\nknowledge. The very concept of physical quantities has to be dramatically changed. We should accept the idea\nthat quantum probabilities, as represented by a density operator, do not simply reflect as usual our ignorance about\nsupposedly preexisting values of physical quantities (such as the position and the momentum of a particle), but arise\nbecause our very conception of physical quantities as scalar numbers, inherited from macroscopic experience, is not in\nadequacy with microscopic reality [10, 11, 31, 34, 36, 48, 85, 299]. Macroscopic physical quantities take scalar values\nthat we can observe, in particular for a pointer, but the scalar values that we are led to attribute to microscopic (noncommuting) observables are the outcome of inferences which are indirectly afforded by our measurement processes.\nFrom an epistemological viewpoint, the statistical interpretation of quantum theory has a dualistic nature, both\nobjective and subjective. On the one hand, observables are associated with the physical properties of a real system.\nOn the other hand, in a given circumstance, the reality of this system is “veiled” [318], in the sense that our knowledge\nabout these physical properties cannot be better than probabilistic, and what we call “state” refers to the information\navailable to observers.\n10.2. Resulting properties\n10.2.1. Contextuality\nInformation about quantum systems can be gained only through complex measurement processes, involving interaction with instruments and selection of the outcomes. What we observe when testing the “state of the system” is in\nfact a joint property of the system S and the apparatus A. Moreover, due to the non-commutation of the observables\nwhich implies their irreducibly probabilistic nature, we cannot assign well defined numerical values to them before\nachievement of the process. These values do not belong to S alone, but also to its experimental context. They have no\nexistence before measurement, but emerge indirectly from interaction with a given instrument A and are defined only\nwith reference to the setting which may determine them.\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n138\n\nIn a theoretical analysis of a measurement process, we have to study the density operator that describes a statistical\nensemble E of joint systems S+A. If we use another apparatus A0 , the ensemble described is changed into E0 . Putting\ntogether results pertaining to E and E0 may produce paradoxical consequences although the tested system S is prepared\nin the same state. The statements of quantum mechanics are meaningful and can be logically combined only if one\ncan imagine a unique experimental context in which the quantities involved might be simultaneously measured.\nThese considerations are illustrated by various odd phenomena that force us to overturn some of our ways of\nthinking. A celebrated example is the violation of Bell’s inequalities, recalled in § 2.2.1. Other quantum phenomena,\ninvolving properties satisfied exactly rather than statistically, may be regarded as failures of ordinary logic. They are\nexemplified by the GHZ paradox [34, 36, 298], recalled below97 .\n10.2.2. Preparations and assignment of states\nQue sera, sera98\nJay Livingston and Ray Evans; sung by Doris Day in The man who knew too much\nIn order to analyze theoretically quantum phenomena, we need to associate with the considered situation the state\nthat describes adequately the system (or rather the set of systems of the considered ensemble). In particular, to study a\ndynamical process in the Schrödinger picture, we must specify the initial state. Such an assignment can be performed\nin various ways, depending on the type of preparation of the system [115, 116].\nTextbooks often stress complete preparations, in which a complete set of commuting observables is controlled;\nsee Refs. [115, 116] for a recent conceptual discussion that goes beyond the average text-book level. The state D̂\nis then the projection on the common eigenvector of these observables determined by their given eigenvalues. (This\nunambiguous determination of D̂ should not hide its probabilistic nature.) The control of a single observable may\nin fact be sufficient to allow a complete preparation of a pure state, in case one is able to select a non-degenerate\neigenvalue that characterizes this state. Atoms or molecules are currently prepared thereby in their non-degenerate\nground state [308].\nAs indicated in § 1.1.4, the ideal measurement of an observable ŝ (like the spin component ŝz in the Curie–Weiss\nmodel considered in the bulk of the present work) of a system S, followed by the selection of the outcome Ai of the\npointer constitutes a preparation through measurement. If the density operator of S before the process is r̂(0), this\nselection produces the filtered state Πi r̂(0)Πi , where Πi denotes the projection operator onto the eigenspace associated\nwith the eigenvalue si of ŝ (see § 11.3.2). This theoretical scheme of preparing states via measurements was realized\nexperimentally [308, 319].\nThere are however other, macroscopic methods of preparing quantum states that are much more incomplete\n[55, 56]. Usually they provide on the quantum system of interest a number of data much too small to characterize a single density operator. As in ordinary probability theory, for describing a macroscopic preparation, one can\nrely on some criterion to select among the allowed D̂’s the least biased one [289]. A current criterion is Laplace’s\n“principle of insufficient reason”: when nothing else is known than the set of possible events, we should assign to\nthem equal probabilities. In fact, this assignment relies implicitly on the existence of some invariance group. For\na discrete set of ordinary events, this is the group of their permutations, as they should be treated a priori on the\nsame footing. In quantum theory, the required prior invariance group is afforded by physics, it is the unitary group in\nHilbert space. When some data are known, namely the expectation values of some observables, Laplace’s principle\ncannot be directly applied since these data constrain the density operator, but one can show that it yields, as least\n97 The GHZ setup is as follows: Consider six observables B̂ and Ĉ (i = 1, 2, 3) such that B̂2 = Ĉ 2 ≡ I,\nˆ Ĉ1 Ĉ2 Ĉ3 ≡ I,\nˆ and with commutators\ni\ni\ni\ni\n(2) (3)\n[ B̂i , B̂ j ] = [Ĉi , Ĉ j ] = 0, [ B̂i , Ĉi ] = 0 and B̂i Ĉ j = −Ĉ j B̂i for i , j. A physical realization with 3 spins is provided by taking B̂1 = σ̂(1)\nx , Ĉ 1 = σ̂z σ̂z\n(2) (3)\n(1) (2) (3)\n(or, more precisely, B̂1 = σ̂(1)\nσ̂\nσ̂\n,\nĈ\n=\nσ̂\nσ̂\nσ̂\n),\nand\nlikewise,\nin\na\ncyclic\nmanner.\nIn\nthe\npure\nstate\ncharacterized\nby\nB̂\nĈ\n= |φi,\n|φi\n|φi\n1\ni i\nx\nz\nz\n0\n0\n0\n\neach one of the three statements “Bi takes the same value as Ci ”, where Bi = ±1 and Ci = ±1 are the values taken by the observables B̂i ând Ĉi ,\nis separately true, and can be experimentally checked. However, these three statements cannot be true together, since the identity Ĉ1 Ĉ2 Ĉ3 ≡ Iˆ\nseems to entail that B1 B2 B3 = +1 in the considered state, whereas the algebra implies B1 B2 B3 = −1, which is confirmed experimentally [38].\nIndeed we are not even allowed to think simultaneously about the values of B1 and C2 , for instance, since these observables do not commute. It\nis not only impossible to measure them simultaneously but it is even “forbidden” (i. e., devoid of any physical meaning) to imagine in a given\nsystem the simultaneous existence of numerical values for them, since these numerical values should be produced through interaction with different\napparatuses\n98 What will be, will be\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n139\n\nbiased density operator among all those compatible with the available data, the one that maximizes the entropy (10.2)\n[313, 320, 321]. In particular, the energy of a small object can be controlled by macroscopic means, exchange of heat\nor of work; depending on the type of control, the maximum entropy criterion leads us to assign a different distribution\nto this object [58, 73, 71]. This distribution should be verified experimentally. For instance, if one controls only the\nexpectation value of its energy, which is free to fluctuate owing to exchanges with a large bath, the least biased state is\nthe canonical one. Alternatively, for a non-extensive system such that the logarithm of its level density is not concave,\nanother type of thermal equilibrium (locally more stable) can be established [322] through a different preparation\ninvolving the confinement of the energy in a narrow range. Within this range, the maximum entropy criterion leads us\nto attribute the same probability to all allowed levels and to adopt a microcanonical distribution.\nThe fact that states of macroscopic systems cannot be characterized completely entails that in measurement models\nthe apparatus should be supposed to have initially been prepared in a mixed state. Thus, the discussion of the quantum\nmeasurement problem within the statistical interpretation does need the existence of macroscopic preparations that\nare different from preparations via quantum measurements.\n10.2.3. Mixed states and pure states\nSomething is rotten in the state of Denmark\nShakespeare, Hamlet\nMost textbooks introduce the principles of quantum mechanics by relying on pure states |ψi, which evolve according to the Schrödinger equation and from which the expectation value of any observable Ô can be evaluated as hψ|Ô|ψi\n[4, 85]. Mixed states, represented by density operators, are then constructed from pure states [4, 85]. This form of\nthe principles entail the above-mentioned laws, namely, the Liouville–von Neumann (or the Heisenberg) equation of\nmotion and the properties of the mapping (10.1) (linearity, reality, positivity and normalization).\nWithin the statistical interpretation, there is at first sight little conceptual difference between pure states and mixed\nstates, since in both cases the density operator behaves as a non-Abelian probability distribution that realizes the\ncorrespondence (10.1) [9, 10, 11, 31, 48, 52, 58, 73]. As a mathematical specificity, pure states are those for which all\neigenvalues but one of the density operator D̂ vanish, or equivalently those for which the von Neumann entropy S (D̂)\nvanishes. They appear thus as extremal among the set of Hermitean positive normalized operators, in the form |ψihψ|.\nHowever, a major physical difference99 , stressed by Park [28], exists, the ambiguity in the decomposition of a mixed\nstate into pure states. This question will play an important rôle in section 11, and we discuss it below.\nLet us first note that a mixed state D̂ can always be decomposed into a weighted sum of projections over pure\nstates, according to\nX\nD̂ =\n|φk iνk hφk |.\n(10.3)\nk\n\nIt is then tempting to interpret this decomposition as follows. Each of the pure states |φk i would describe systems\nbelonging to an ensemble Ek , and the ensemble E described by D̂ would be built by extracting a proportion νk\nof systems from each ensemble Ek . Such an interpretation is consistent with the definition of quantum states as\nP\nmappings (10.1) of the set of observables onto their expectation values, since (10.3) implies hÔi = k νk hφk |Ô|φk i =\ntr D̂Ô. It is inspired by classical statistical mechanics, where a mixed state, represented by a density in phase space,\ncan be regarded in a unique fashion as a weighted sum over pure states localized at given points in phase space.\nHowever, in quantum mechanics, the state D̂ (unless it is itself pure) can be decomposed as (10.3) in an infinity of\ndifferent ways. For instance, the 2 × 2 density operator D̂ = 21 σ̂0 which represents an unpolarized spin 12 might be\ninterpreted as describing a spin polarized either along +z with probability 12 or along −z with probability 21 ; but these\n99 Another essential difference between pure and mixed states is especially appealing to intuition [79, 276]. Consider a system in a state represented by a density operator D̂ whose eigenvalues are non-degenerate and differ from zero. Consider next a set of observables that have nondegenerate spectra. Then none of such observables can produce definite results when measured in the state D̂ [276]. In other words, all such\nobservables have non-zero dispersion in D̂. This statement has been suitably generalized when either D̂ or the observables have degeneracies\nin their spectra; see Appendix C of Ref. [276]. In contrast, for a pure density operator |ψihψ| all observables that have |ψi as eigenvector are\ndispersionless. Pure and mixed states also differ as regards their preparation and as regards their determination via measurements (e.g., the number\nof observables to be measured for a complete state determination) [323]\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n140\n\ntwo possible directions of polarization may also be taken as +x and −x, or as +y and −y; the same isotropic state\nD̂ = 21 σ̂0 can also be interpreted by assuming that the direction of polarization is fully random [31, 48]. Within the\nstatistical interpretation of quantum mechanics, this ambiguity of the decompositions of D̂ prevents us from selecting\na “fundamental” decomposition and to give a sense to the pure states |φk i and the weights νk entering (10.3).\nMore generally, we may decompose the given state D̂ into a weighted sum\nX\nD̂ =\nνk D̂k\n(10.4)\nk\n\nof density operators D̂k associated with subensembles Ek . But here again, such a decomposition can always be\nperformed in an infinity of different ways, which appear as contradictory. Due to this ambiguity, splitting the ensemble\nE described by D̂ into subensembles Ek , described either by pure states as in (10.3) or by mixed states as in (10.4), is\nphysically meaningless (though mathematically correct) if no other information than D̂ is available.\nThe above indetermination leads us to acknowledge an important difference between pure and mixed quantum\nstates [9, 28, 31, 48, 85, 28, 324]. If a statistical ensemble E of systems is described by a pure state, any one of its\nsubensembles is also described by the same pure state, since in this case (10.4) can include only a single term. If\nfor instance a set of spins have been prepared in the polarized state |↑i, the statistical prediction about any subset are\nembedded in |↑i as for the whole set. In contrast, the existence of many decompositions (10.3) or (10.4) of a mixed\nstate D̂ describing an ensemble E implies that there exists many ways of splitting this ensemble into subensembles Ek\nthat would be described by different states D̂k . In particular, pure states |φk i that would underlie as in (10.3) a mixed D̂\ncannot a posteriori be identified unambiguously by means of experiments performed on the ensemble of systems. In\nthe statistical interpretation, such underlying pure states have no physical meaning. More generally, decompositions\nof the type (10.4) can be given a meaning only if the knowledge of D̂ is completed with extra information, allowing\none to identify, within the considered ensemble E described by D̂, subensembles Ek that do have a physical meaning\n[31, 48, 324].\nAccording to this remark, since the outcome of a large set of measurements is represented by a mixed state\nD̂(tf ), this state can be decomposed in many different ways into a sum of the type (10.4). The decomposition (9.1),\neach term of which is associated with an indication Ai of the pointer, is not the only one. This ambiguity of D̂(tf ),\nas regards the splitting of the ensemble E that it describes into subensembles, will be discussed in § 11.1.3, and\nwe will show subsections 11.2 and 13.1 how the dynamics of the process removes this ambiguity by privileging the\ndecomposition (9.1) and yielding a physical meaning to each of its separate terms, thus allowing us to make statements\nabout individual systems.\n10.2.4. Ensembles versus aggregates\nWe have assumed above that the density operator D̂ and the corresponding ensemble E were given a priori. In\npractice, the occurrence of a mixed state D̂ can have various origins. An incomplete preparation (§ 10.2.2) always\nyields a mixed state, for instance, the initial state R̂(0) of the apparatus in a measurement model. The mixed nature\nof a state may be enhanced by dynamics, when some randomness occurs in the couplings or when approximations,\njustified for a large system, are introduced; this is illustrated by the final state D̂(t f ) of a measurement process.\nDensity operators have also been introduced by Landau in a different context [31, 48, 85]. Consider a compound\nsystem S1 + S2 . Its observables are the operators that act in the Hilbert space H = H1 ⊗ H2 , and its states D̂ are\ncharacterized by the correspondence (10.1) in the space H. If we are interested only in the subsystem S1 , disregarding\nthe properties of S2 and the correlations between S1 and S2 , the relevant observables constitute the subalgebra of\noperators acting in H1 , and the correspondence (10.1) is implemented in the subspace H1 by means of the mixed\ndensity operator D̂1 = tr2 D̂. Suppose for instance that in an ensemble E of pairs S1 , S2 of spins 21 prepared in the\nsinglet pure state 2−1/2 ( |↑i1 |↑i2 − |↓i1 |↓i2 ), we wish to describe only the spin S1 . Its marginal state in the considered\nensemble E is again the unpolarized state, represented by D̂1 = 21 σ̂(1)\n0 . Isotropy is here built in, from this definition of\nthe state of the spin S1 .\nIn all such cases, the state D̂ describes a statistical ensemble E, and the argument of § 10.2.3 entails the impossibility of splitting unambiguous this ensemble into subensembles described by well defined pure states.\nAnother approach to density operators, initiated by von Neumann [4], consists in constructing them from pure\nstates, by following a path converse to that of § 10.2.3. We start from a collection of statistical ensembles Ek of\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n141\n\nsystems prepared in pure states |φk i. We build a new set E by extracting randomly each individual system of E\nfrom one among the ensembles Ek , the probability of this extraction being νk . If we have lost track of the original\nensemble Ek from which each drawing was performed, we have no means to acknowledge in which pure state |φk i\na given system of E was originally lying. The expectation value, for this system, of any quantity is then given\nP\nby hÔi = k νk hφk |Ô|φk i = tr D̂Ô, and we are led to assign to it the mixed state defined by (10.3). Here again,\nthe ambiguity of § 10.2.3 is present: If two different constructions have lead to the same state D̂, they cannot be\ndistinguished from each other in any measurement.\nA further important point should be stressed. The above procedure of randomly selecting the elements extracted\nfrom the ensembles Ek produces a set E of systems which is a bona fide ensemble. Indeed, a statistical ensemble\nmust have an essential property, the statistical independence of its elements, and this property is here ensured by the\nrandomness of the drawings. Thus, our full information about the ensemble, and not only about each of its individual\nsystems, is embedded in the density operator D̂. In the ensemble E obtained after mixing, the pure states |φk i have\nbeen completely lost, although they were originally meaningful. In other words, no observation of an ensemble E\nobtained by merging subensembles Ek can reveal the history of its elaboration.\nAnother, slightly different construction, also inspired by von Neumann’s idea, is preferred by some authors, see,\ne.g., [318]. In this alternative procedure, a (non random) number nk of systems is extracted from each ensemble Ek so\nP\nas to constitute a set A having n = k nk elements, which we term as an aggregate. Losing again track of the origin\nof each system of A, we have to assign to any individual system of A the density operator (10.3), with νk = nk /n.\nHowever, in spite of this analogy with the ensemble E constructed above, we will acknowledge an important difference\nbetween the two situations, due to the nature of the numbers νk , which are probabilities for E, proportions for A.\nAs an illustration, let us consider the aggregate Az built by gathering n1 = 21 n spins prepared in the pure state\n|↑i (sz = +1) and n2 = 21 n spins prepared in the pure state |↓i (sz = −1), and by forgetting the original state of\neach spin. Each individual spin of the aggregate Az in then described by the unpolarized density operator D̂ = 21 σ̂0 ,\nexactly as each spin of the ensemble Ez , obtained by picking up states |↑i or |↓i randomly with equal probabilities.\nNevertheless, the joint statistics of two systems belonging to the aggregate Az differs from that of two spins belonging\nto the ensemble Ez (which are statistically independent). Indeed, the systems of an aggregate are correlated, due to\nthe construction procedure. In our spin example, this is flagrant for n1 = n2 = 1: if we measure the first spin down, we\nknow for sure that the second is up. More generally, if σ̂z is simultaneously measured on all n spins of the aggregate\nAz , the correlations will be expressed by the equality of the number of outcomes ↑ and ↓. If the ideal measurement\nbears on n − 1 spins, we can predict for the last spin the sign of σz with 100% confidence. For an ensemble Ez\ncontaining n spins, we cannot infer anything about the n’th spin from the outcomes of previous measurements on the\nn − 1 other ones.\nAltogether, an aggregate is not a statistical ensemble, because its elements are correlated with one another. A\nrandom selection is needed in von Neumann’s procedure of defining mixed states, so as to ensure the statistical\nindependence required for ensembles.\nThe above point was purely classical (since we dealt with the z-component only), but it can have quantum implications. Prepare another aggregate A x with n1 spins oriented in the +x-direction and n2 spins oriented in the\n−x-direction. Consider likewise the ensemble E x built by randomly selecting spins in the +x- and −x-directions, with\nequal probabilities. Any single system belonging to either Az or Ez or A x or E x is described by the same unpolarized\ndensity operator 12 σ̂0 . However, differences occur when correlations between systems are accounted for. We first remember that the ensembles Ez and E x are undistinguishable. In contrast, the two aggregates Az and A x have different\nproperties. Measuring for A x , as above for Az , the components σ̂z of all the n spins of A x does not show up the\ncorrelations that were exhibited for Az : Instead of finding exactly 21 n spins up and 12 n spins down, we find outcomes\nthat are statistically independent, and characterized by a same binomial law as in the case of the ensembles Ez or E x .\nWithin A x the correlations occur between x-components.\nHence, failing to distinguish aggregates from ensembles leads to the inevitable conclusion that “two ensembles\nhaving the same density matrix can be distinguished from each other” [318]. This statement has influenced similar\nconclusions by other authors, see e.g. [325]. The persistent occurrence of such an idea in the literature (see [326])\ndemonstrates that the difference between ensembles and aggregates is indeed far from being trivial. In the light of\nthe above discussion, and in agreement with [327] and [328], we consider such statements as incorrect. Indeed, two\naggregates having for a single system the same density matrix can be distinguished from each other via two-system\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n142\n\n(or many-system) measurements, but two statistical ensembles cannot.\n11. Solving the quantum measurement problem within the statistical interpretation\nAll’s well that ends well\nShakespeare\nIn section 9 we have resumed the detailed solution of the dynamical equation for the Curie–Weiss model. As\nother models of measurement treated in the framework of quantum statistical dynamics (section 2), it yields, for the\ncompound system S + A at the end of the process, a density operator D̂(tf ) which satisfies the properties required for\nideal measurements. However, we have already stressed that such a result, although necessary, is not sufficient to afford a complete understanding of quantum measurements. Indeed, the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics\nemphasizes the idea that this theory, whether it deals with pure or mixed states, does not govern individual systems but\nstatistical ensembles of systems (§ 10.1.3). Within this statistical interpretation, the density operator D̂(tf ) accounts\nin a probabilistic way for a large set E of similar runs of the experiment, whereas a measurement involves properties\nof individual runs. Can we then make assertions about the individual runs? This question is the core of the present\nsection.\nThe remaining challenge is to elucidate the quantum measurement problem, that is, to explain why each individual\nrun provides a definite outcome, for both the apparatus and the tested system. As we will discuss, this property is not\ngranted by the knowledge of D̂(tf ), an object associated with the full set E. Since we deal only with ensembles,\nthe individual systems that we wish to consider within the statistical interpretation should be embedded in some\nsubensembles of E, which should eventually be characterised by a specific outcome. Our strategy will rely on a study\nof the dynamics of such subensembles under the effect of interactions within the apparatus. It will be essential in\nthis respect to note that, within its statistical interpretation, standard quantum mechanics applies not only to the full\nensemble E of runs, but also to any one of its subensembles – even though we are unable to identify a priori which\nstate corresponds to a given subset of physical runs.\n11.1. Formulating the problem: Seeking a physical way out of a mathematical embarrassment\n“There must be some way out of here”, said the joker to the thief\nfrom Bob Dylan’s song All Along the Watchtower, re-recorded by Jimi Hendrix\nThe present subsection aims at introducing in a tutorial scope the specific difficulties encountered when facing the\nquantum measurement problem in the framework of the statistical interpretation. It also presents some ideas that look\nnatural but lead to failures. It mainly addresses students; the readers aware of such questions may jump to subsection\n11.2.\n11.1.1. A physical, but simplistic and circular argument\nUne idée simple mais fausse s’impose toujours face à une idée juste mais compliquée100\nAlexis de Tocqueville\nAs shown by the review of section 2 and by the Curie–Weiss example of section 3, many models of ideal quantum\nmeasurements rely on the following ideas. The apparatus A is a macroscopic system which has several possible stable\nstates R̂i characterized by the value Ai of the (macroscopic) pointer variable. If A is initially set into a metastable\nstate R̂(0), it may spontaneously switch towards one or another state R̂i after a long time. In a measurement, this\ntransition is triggered by the coupling with the tested object S, it happens faster, and it creates correlations such that, if\nthe apparatus reaches the state R̂i , the tested observable ŝ takes the value si . The neat separation between the states R̂i\nand their long lifetime, together with the lack of survival of “Schrödinger cats”, suggest that each individual process\nhas a unique outcome, characterized by the indication Ai of the pointer and by the value si for the observable ŝ of the\nsystem S.\n100 A simple but wrong idea always prevails over a right but complex idea\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n143\n\nThis intuitive argument, based on current macroscopic experimental observation and on standard classical theories\nof phase transitions, is nevertheless delusive. Although its outcome will eventually turn out to be basically correct,\nit postulates the very conclusion we wish to justify, namely that the apparatus reaches in each run one or another\namong the states R̂i . This idea is based on a classical type of reasoning applied blindly to subtle properties of quantum ensembles, which is known to produce severe mistakes (prescribed ensemble fallacy) [329, 330, 331, 332]. In\norder to explain why the indication of the apparatus is unique in a single experiment, we ought to analyze quantum\nmeasurements by means of rigorous quantum theoretical arguments.\n11.1.2. Where does the difficulty lie?\nAfter all is said and done, more is said than done\nAesop\nThe most detailed statistical mechanical treatments of ideal measurement models provide the evolution of the\ndensity operator D̂(t) of the compound system S + A, from the initial state\nD̂(0) = r̂(0) ⊗ R̂(0),\n\n(11.1)\n\nto the final state\nD̂(tf ) =\n\nX\n\npi D̂i ,\n\nD̂i = r̂i ⊗ R̂i ,\n\npi = trS r̂(0)Π̂i ,\n\npi r̂i = Π̂i r̂(0)Π̂i .\n\n(11.2)\n\ni\n\nIn the Curie–Weiss model its explicit form is the expression (3.21), that is,\nD̂(tf ) = p↑ |↑ih↑| ⊗ R̂⇑ + p↓ |↓ih↓| ⊗ R̂⇓ .\n\n(11.3)\n\nAs we wish to interpret this result physically, we recall its nature. The state D̂(t) provides a faithful probabilistic\naccount for the dynamics of the expectation values of all observables of S + A, for a large set E of runs of similarly\nprepared experiments, but nothing more. We need, however, to focus on individual runs so as to explain in particular\nwhy, at the end of each run, the pointer yields a well-defined indication Ai . This property agrees with our macroscopic experience and seems trivial, but it is not granted in the quantum framework. Quantum mechanics is our most\nfundamental theory, but even a complete solution of its dynamical equations refers only to the statistics of an ensemble E. The description of individual processes is excluded (§ 10.1.3): As any quantum state, (11.2) is irreducibly\nprobabilistic. In fact, probabilities occur for many other reasons (§ 12.1.2), which have not necessarily a quantum\norigin.\nThe specific form of the expression (11.2) for the final state of S + A properly accounts for all the features of\nideal measurements that are related the large set E of runs. Von Neumann’s reduction implies that each individual run\nshould end up one of the states D̂i , which exhibits in a factorized form the expected complete correlation between\nthe final state r̂i of S and that R̂i of A characterized by the indication Ai of the pointer. The ensemble E obtained by\nputting together these runs should thus be represented by a sum of these blocks D̂i , weighted by Born’s probabilities,\nin agreement with (11.2). The truncation of the off-diagonal blocks was also needed; as shown in § 11.2.1, the\npresence of sizeable elements in them would forbid the pointer to give well-defined indications.\nNevertheless, in spite of its suggestive form, the expression (11.2) does not imply all properties of ideal measurements, which require the consideration of individual runs, or at least of subensembles of E. The correlation existing\nin (11.2) means that, if Ai is observed, S will be described by r̂i . However, nothing in D̂(tf ) warrants that one can\nobserve some well-defined value of the pointer in an individual run [178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184], so that\nthe standard classical interpretation cannot be given to this quantum correlation. Likewise, Born’s rule means that\na proportion pi of individual runs end up in the state D̂i . The validity of this rule requires D̂(tf ) to have the form\n(11.2); but conversely, as will be discussed in § 11.1.3, the sole result (11.2) is not sufficient to explain Born’s rule\nwhich requires the counting of the individual runs tagged by the outcome Ai . And of course von Neumann’s reduction\nrequires a selection of the runs having produced a given outcome.\nIf quantum mechanics were based on the same kind of probabilities as classical physics, it would be obvious\nto infer statistically the properties of individual systems from the probability distribution governing the statistical\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n144\n\nensemble to which they belong. At first sight, the description of a quantum ensemble by a density operator seems\nanalogous to the description of an ensemble of classical statistical mechanics by a probability density in phase space\n– or to the description of some ensemble of events by ordinary probabilities. We must acknowledge, however, a major\ndifference. In ordinary probability theory, one can distinguish exclusive properties, one of which unambiguously\noccurs for each individual event. When we toss a coin, we get either heads or tails. In contrast, a quantum state is\nplagued by the impossibility of analyzing it in terms of an exclusive alternative, as demonstrated by the example of an\nunpolarized spin 21 (§ 10.2.3). We are not allowed to think, in this case, that the spin may lie either in the +z (or the\n−z) direction, since we might as well have thought that it lay either in the +x (or the −x) direction.\nThis ambiguity of a mixed quantum state may also be illustrated, in the Curie–Weiss model, by considering the\nfinal state of the magnet M alone. For the ensemble E, it is described by the density operator R̂M (tf ) = Pdis\nM (m̂, tf )/G(m̂),\nwhere the probability distribution Pdis\n(m,\nt\n)\nis\nstrongly\npeaked\naround\nthe\ntwo\nvalues\nm\n=\nm\nand\nm\n= −mF of the\nf\nF\nM\npointer variable m, with the weights p↑ and p↓ . In standard probability theory this would imply that for a single\nsystem m takes either the value mF or the value −mF . However, in quantum mechanics, an individual system should\nbe regarded as belonging to some subensemble E0k of E. We may imagine, for instance, that this subensemble is\ndescribed by a pure state |ψi such that |hm, η|ψi|2 presents the same two peaks as PM (m, tf ), where we noted as |m, ηi\nthe eigenstates of m̂ (the other quantum number η takes a number G(m) of values for each m). This state lies astride\nthe two ferromagnetic configurations, with coherences, so that the magnetization of the considered individual system\ncannot have a definite sign. From the sole knowledge of R̂M (tf ), we cannot infer the uniqueness of the macroscopic\nmagnetization.\nThus, albeit both quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics can be formulated as theories dealing\nwith statistical ensembles, going to individual systems is automatic in the latter case, but problematic in the former\ncase since it is impossible to characterize unambiguously the subensembles of E.\n11.1.3. A crucial task: theoretical identification of the subensembles of real runs\nHorresco referens101\nVirgil, Aeneid\nRemember first that, when quantum mechanics is used to describe an individual system, the density operator\nthat characterizes its state refers either to a real or to a thought ensemble (§ 10.1.3). If we consider a real set E of\nmeasurement processes, each individual outcome should be embedded in a real subset of E. We are thus led to study\nthe various possible splittings of E into subensembles.\nA superficial examination of the final state (11.2) suggests the following argument. In the same way as we may\nobtain an unpolarized spin state by merging two populations of spins separately prepared in the states |↑i and |↓i, let us\nimagine that we have prepared many compound systems S + A in the equilibrium states D̂i . We build ensembles Ei ,\neach of which contains a proportion pi of systems in the state D̂i , merge them into a single one E and lose track of this\nconstruction. The resulting state for the ensemble E is identified with (11.2) and all predictions made thereafter about\nE will be the same as for the state D̂(tf ) issued from the dynamics of the measurement process. It is tempting to admit\nconversely that the set E of runs of the measurement may be split into subsets Ei , each of which being characterized\nby the state D̂i . This would be true in ordinary probability theory. If the reasoning were also correct in quantum\nmechanics, we would have proven that each run belongs to one of the subsets Ei , so that it leads S + A to one or\nanother among the states D̂i at the time tf , and that its outcome is well-defined.\nHere as in § 11.1.1 the above argument is fallacious. Indeed, as stressed in § 10.2.3, and contrarily to a state in\nclassical statistical mechanics, a mixed state D̂ can be split in many different incompatible ways into a weighted sum\nof density operators which are more informative than D̂. Here, knowing the sole final state D̂(tf ) for the set E of runs,\nwe can decompose it not only according to (11.2), but alternatively into one out of many different forms\nD̂(tf ) =\n\nX\nk\n\n101 I shiver while I am telling it\n\nνk D̂0k (tf ),\n\n(νk ≥ 0;\n\nX\nk\n\nνk = 1),\n\n(11.4)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n145\n\nwhere the set of states D̂0k (tf ), possibly pure, differ from the set D̂i : The very concept of decomposition is ambiguous.\nIf we surmise, as we did above above when we regarded E as the union of (thought) subensembles Ei described by\nD̂i , that the density operator D̂0k (tf ) is associated with a (thought) subset E0k of E containing a fraction νk of runs of the\nmeasurement, we stumble upon a physical contradiction: The full set E of runs could be partitioned in different ways,\nso that a given run would belong both to a subset Ei and to a subset E0k , but then we could not decide whether its final\nstate is D̂i or D̂0k (tf ), which provide different expectation values.\nWhile D̂(tf ) is physically meaningful, its various decompositions (11.2) and (11.4) are purely mathematical properties without physical relevance. Unless we succeed to identify some physical process that selects one of them, the\nvery fact that they formally exist precludes the task considered here, namely to explain the uniqueness of individual\nmeasurements, the quantum measurement problem. In the present context, only the decompositions involving the\nparticular density operators D̂i may be physically meaningful, i. e., may correspond to the splitting of the real set E\nof runs described by D̂(tf ) into actually existing subsets. If we wish to remain within standard quantum mechanics we\ncan only identify such a physical decomposition by studying dynamics of subensembles. Nothing a priori warrants\nthat the set of states D̂i will then play a privileged role, and this specific ambiguity is the form taken here by the\nquantum measurement problem.\nThe above ambiguity is well known in the literature [22, 331, 329, 332]. Not paying attention to its existence, and\nthen imposing by hand the desired separation into subensembles, was called the “prescribed ensemble fallacy” [332].\nThe question does not seem to have yet been resolved in the context of proper measurement models, but we attempt\nto answer it below.\nTo illustrate the harmfulness of this ambiguity, consider the simple case of a Curie–Weiss model with N = 2\n(subsection 8.1). Although it cannot be regarded as an ideal measurement, it will clearly exhibit the present difficulty.\nAfter elimination of the bath, after reduction and under the conditions (8.7), the state of S + M at a time tf such that\nτreg \u001c tf \u001c τobs has the form\nD̂(tf ) = p↑ D̂↑ + p↓ D̂↓ ,\n\n(11.5)\n\nwhere D̂↑ is the projection onto the pure state |↑, ⇑i characterized by the quantum numbers sz = 1, m = 1, and likewise\nD̂↓ the projection onto |↓, ⇓i with sz = m = −1. This form suggests that individual runs of the measurement should\nlead as expected either to the state | ↑, ⇑i or to the state | ↓, ⇓i with probabilities p↑ and p↓ given by the Born rule.\nHowever, this conclusion is not granted since we can also decompose D̂(tf ) according, for instance, to\nD̂(tf ) = ν1 D̂01 + ν2 D̂02 ,\n(11.6)\np\np\np\nwhere D̂01 is the projection onto p↑ /ν1 cos α |↑, ⇑i + p↓ /ν1 sin α |↓, ⇓i and D̂02 the projection onto p↑ /ν2 sin α ×\np\n|↑, ⇑i − p↓ /ν2 cos α |↓, ⇓i, with α arbitrary and ν1 = p↑ cos2 α + p↓ sin2 α = 1 − ν2 . Nothing would then prevent the\nreal runs of the measurement to constitute two subensembles described at the final time by D̂01 and D̂02 , respectively; in\nsuch a case, neither m nor sz could take a well-defined value in each run. In spite of the suggestive form of (11.5), we\ncannot give any physical interpretation to its separate terms, on account of the existence of an infinity of alternative\nformally similar decompositions (11.6) with arbitrary angle α.\nIn order to interpret the results drawn from the solution of models, it is therefore essential to determine not only the\nstate D̂(t) for the full ensemble E of runs of the measurement, but also the final state of S + A for any real subensemble\nof runs. Only then may one be able to assign to an individual system, after the end of the process, a density operator\nmore informative than D̂(tf ) and to derive from it the required properties of an ideal measurement.\nTo this end, one might postulate that a measuring apparatus is a macroscopic device which produces at each run\na well-defined value for the pointer variable, a specific property which allows registration. (This idea is somewhat\nreminiscent of Bohr’s view that the apparatus is classical.) Thus, the apparatus would first be treated as a quantum\nobject so as to determine the solution D̂(t) of the Liouville–von Neumann equation for the full ensemble E, and would\nthen be postulated to behave classically so as to determine the states of the subensembles to which the individual runs\nbelong. No contradiction would arise, owing to the reduced form found for D̂(tf ). (This viewpoint differs from that of\nthe quantum–classical models of section 2.2.)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n146\n\nAlthough expedient, such a way of eliminating the ambiguity of the decomposition of D̂(tf ) is unsatisfactory. It\nis obviously unjustified in the above N = 2 case. To really solve the measurement problem, we need to explain the\nbehavior of the apparatus in individual runs by relying on the sole principles of quantum mechanics, instead of supplementing them with a doubtful postulate. We now show that the task of understanding from quantum dynamics the\nuniqueness of measurement outcomes is feasible, at least for sufficiently elaborate models of quantum measurements.\nIn fact, we will prove in the forthcoming subsections that the quantum Curie–Weiss model for a magnetic dot M + B\ncan be modified so as to explain the classical behavior of its ferromagnetic phases, and hence the full properties of\nthe measurement.\n11.2. The states describing subensembles at the final time\nDe hond bijt de kat niet102\nLes chiens ne font pas des chats102\nDutch and French sayings\nQuantum mechanics in its statistical interpretation does not allow us to deal directly with individual runs of the\nmeasurement. However, at least it accounts not only for the full ensemble, but also for arbitrary subensembles of\nruns. We first exhibit necessary properties that such subensembles should fulfill at the final time (§ 11.2.1), then relate\nthese properties to the “collectives” introduced in the frequency interpretation of probabilities (§ 11.2.2). We plan to\nestablish that they are ensured by a quantum relaxation process, relying for illustration on the Curie–Weiss model. We\nfirst present a seemingly natural but unsuccessful attempt (§ 11.2.3), in order to show that the required process cannot\nbe implemented before registration is achieved. We then present two alternative solutions. The first one (§ 11.2.4) is\nefficient but requires somewhat artificial interactions within the pointer. The second one (§ 11.2.5) is more general\nand more realistic but less elementary.\n11.2.1. Hierarchic structure of physical subensembles\nUn poème n’est jamais fini, seulement abandonné103\nPaul Valéry\nA model suitable to fully explain an ideal measurement must yield for S + A, at the end of each run, one or another\namong the states D̂i defined by (11.2). We do not have direct access to individual runs, but should regard them as\nembedded in subensembles. Consider then an arbitrary subensemble of real runs drawn from the full ensemble E and\ncontaining a proportion qi of individual runs of the type i. We expect this subensemble Esub to be described at the end\nof the measurement process by a density operator of the form\nD̂sub (tf ) =\n\nX\n\nqi D̂i .\n\n(11.7)\n\ni\n\nThe coefficients qi are non-negative and sum up to 1, but are otherwise arbitrary, depending on the subensemble104 .\n(2)\nThey satisfy the following additivity property. If two disjoint subensembles E(1)\nsub and Esub containing N1 and N2\nelements, respectively, merge so as to produce the subensemble Esub containing N = N1 + N2 elements, the additivity\n(2)\nof the corresponding coefficients is expressed by Nqi = N1 q(1)\ni + N2 qi , with weights proportional to the sizes of the\nsubensembles.\nWe will refer to the essential property (11.7) as the hierarchic structure of subensembles. It involves two essential\nfeatures, the occurrence of the same building blocks D̂i for all subensembles, and the additivity of the coefficients qi .\nThe existence of this common form for all subensembles is a consistency property. It is trivially satisfied in ordinary\nprobability theory within the frequency interpretation (§ 11.2.2), since there all subensembles are constructed from the\n102 Dogs do not beget cats\n103 A poem is never finished, just abandoned\n104 In particular, the state D̂(t ) describing the full ensemble E has the form (11.7) where the coefficients q are replaced by the probabilities p of\ni\ni\nf\nBorn’s rule. If this ensemble is split into some set of disjoint subensembles, each pi of E is a weighted sum of the corresponding coefficients qi for\nthese subensembles\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n147\n\nsame building blocks, but it is not granted in quantum mechanics due to the infinity of different ways of splitting the\nstate of E into elementary components as in (10.3), or into subensembles as in (10.4). The existence of the hierarchic\nstructure removes this ambiguity stressed in § 11.1.3. In fact, for an arbitrary decomposition (11.4) of D̂(tf ), the state\nD̂0k (tf ) that describes at the final time some subset E0k of runs has no reason to take the form (11.7). We must therefore\nprove that the final state of any subensemble of E has the form (11.7).\nSince we will rely on the analysis of E into subensembles in order to extrapolate quantum mechanics towards\nsome properties of individual systems, we stress here that these subensembles must be completely arbitrary. Had we\nextracted from E only large subensembles with elements selected randomly, their coefficients qi would most often have\ntaken values close to the Born coefficients pi . We want, however, to consider also more exceptional subensembles that\ninvolve arbitrary coefficients qi , so as to encompass the limiting cases for which one qi reaches the value 1, a substitute\nto single systems which are not dealt with directly in the statistical interpretation. To take an image, consider a game\nin which we would be allowed only to toss many coins at a time. Most draws would provide nearly as many heads as\ntails; if however we wish to infer from these experiments that tossing a single coin would yield either heads or tails,\nwe have to acknowledge the occurrence of exceptional draws where all coins fall on the same side. Admittedly, this\nexample is improper as it disregards the quantum ambiguity of subensembles, but it may give an idea of the reasoning\nthat we have in mind.\nTruncation is the disappearance of off-diagonal blocks (§ 1.3.2). Note that the allowed states (11.7) of subensembles are all truncated. Although the state D̂(tf ) of the full ensemble has a truncated form, nothing prevents its decompositions (11.4) to involve non-zero elements in off-diagonal blocks. (These elements only have to cancel out in the\nsum over k of (11.4).) Such a situation is exemplified by (11.6) for sin 2α , 0, in which case D̂01 possesses pairs of\noff-diagonal terms of the form | ↑, ⇑ih↓, ⇓ | and | ↓, ⇓ih↑, ⇑ |. Due to the positivity of D̂01 , the presence of these terms\nimplies the simultaneous occurrence of the two corresponding diagonal terms |↑, ⇑ih↑, ⇑| and |↓, ⇓ih↓, ⇓|, and hence of\nboth indications of the pointer. A well-defined indication of the pointer would therefore be unexplainable in such a\nsituation.\nOur strategy will again rely on a dynamic analysis, now not for the whole ensemble as before, but for an arbitrary\nsubensemble. Consider, at the time tsplit , some splitting of E into subensembles E0k . We select one of these, denoted as\nEsub and described for t > tsplit by the state D̂sub (t). Since D̂sub (tsplit ) is issued from a decomposition of D̂(tsplit ) of the\ntype (11.4), it presents some arbitrariness, but is constrained by the positivity of D̂(tsplit ) − νk D̂sub (tsplit ) for a sizable\nvalue of νk . We will then study, at least in the Curie–Weiss model, the Liouville–von Neumann evolution of the state\nD̂sub (t), starting from the time t = tsplit at which it was selected, and will prove that it relaxes towards the form (11.7)\nat the final time tf .\nActually, we need the hierarchic structure (11.7) to hold for the subensembles of real runs. We have no means\nof identifying the decompositions of E into subsets of real runs. However, by considering all possible mathematical\nsplittings of D̂(tsplit ), we can ascertain that the entire set of states that we are considering contains the states which\ndescribe real processes. Thus we do not have to care whether the subensemble Esub described by D̂sub (t) is virtual\nor real. We could not decide beforehand whether Esub was real or virtual, but all real subensembles will anyhow be\naccounted for by this treatment, which will therefore yield the desired conclusion.\n11.2.2. Hierarchic structure from the viewpoint of the frequency interpretation of the probability\nC’est dans les vieux pots qu’on fait la meilleure soupe105\nFrench proverb\nThe notion of hierarchic structure for subsensembles can be enlightened by comparison with the basic concepts\nof the frequency interpretation of probability, as developed by Venn and von Mises [309, 310]. This interpretation\nappeals to the physicist’s intuition [333], but its direct usage in physics problems is not frequent (in 1929 when the\nreview paper [333] was written it was hoped to find wide applications in physics). Only recently scholars started to\nuse this interpretation for elucidating difficult questions of quantum mechanics [314, 315].\nThe major point of the frequency interpretation is that the usual notion of an ensemble E is supplemented by two\nadditional requirements, and then the ensemble becomes a collective as defined in [310].\n105 The best soup is made in the old pots\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n148\n\n(i) The ensemble (of events characterized by some set of numerical values) allows choosing specific subensembles,\nall elements of which have the same numerical value. Provided that for each such value x one chooses the maximally\nlarge subensemble E, the probability of x is defined via limN→∞ N x /N, where N x and N are, respectively, the number\nof elements in E x and E. The limit is demanded to be unique.\n(ii) Assuming that the elements σk of E are indexed, k = 1, 2...N, consider a set of integers φ(k), where the function\nφ(k) is strictly increasing,i.e., φ(k1 ) < φ(k2 ) for k1 < k2 . We stress that φ does not depend on the value of σ, but it\nonly depends on its index k. Select the elements Eφ(k) so as to build a subensemble E[φ] of E. If for or instance,\nφ(k) = 2k − 1, we select the elements with odd indices. For N → ∞, one now demands that for all such φ(...), E[φ]\nproduces the same probabilities as E.\nThe first condition is needed to define probabilities, the second one excludes any internal order in the ensemble\nso as to make it statistical (or random). This condition led to an extended criticism of the frequency approach [333],\nbut it does capture the basic points of defining the randomness in practice, e.g. judging on the quality of a random\nnumber generator [334]. It is clear that some condition like (ii) is needed for any ensemble (not only a collective)\nto have a physical meaning. For instance, keeping this condition in mind, we see again why the aggregates are not\nproper statistical ensembles; as instead of (ii) their construction introduces correlations between their elements (see\n§ 10.2.4).\nThe fact that within the frequency interpretation, the probability is always defined with respect to a definite collective allows to avoid many sophisms of the classical probability theory [310]. Likewise, it was recently argued\nthat the message of the violation of the Bell inequalities in quantum mechanics is related to inapplicability of the\nKolmogorov’s model of probability, but can be peacefully accommodated into the frequency interpretation [315].\nReturning to our immediate purposes, we note that the hierarchic structure of the subensembles that we wish to\nestablish is a direct consequence of the first condition on collectives recalled above. Indeed, the additivity of the\ncoefficients qi , in the sense defined after (11.7), is the same as the additivity of frequencies limN→∞ N x /N. If the\nfrequencies would be non-additive, one can separate E into two subensembles such that the unique limit limN→∞ N x /N\non E does not exist.\nThus the hierarchical structure of ensembles reconciles the logical Bayesian approach to probabilities with the\nfrequency interpretation. The former, which underlies the definition of a state as a collection of expectation values,\nallows us to speak of probabilities before constructing the full theory of quantum measurement, while the frequency\ninterpretation will support the solution of the measurement problem (see section 11.3.1). A similar bridge between the\ntwo interpretations is found in the purely classical set-up of selecting the non-informative prior probability distribution,\nthe most controversial aspect of the Bayesian statistics [335, 336, 337] 106 .\n11.2.3. Attempt of early truncation\nNo diguis blat fins que no estigui al sac i ben lligat107\nCatalan proverb\nIf we take the splitting time after achievement of the truncation (tsplit \u001d τtrunc ), under conditions that exclude\nrecurrences, we are at least ensured that all elements in off-diagonal blocks are eliminated from the density matrix\nD̂(tsplit ) for the full ensemble E. In order to extend this property to the subensembles of E, it is natural to try to\napproach the problem as in section 5. We thus take a splitting time tsplit , satisfying τtrunc \u001c tsplit \u001c τreg , sufficiently\nP\nshort so that D̂(tsplit ) has the form i Π̂i r̂(0)Π̂i ⊗ R̂(0) issued from D̂(0) by projecting out its off-diagonal blocks; the\nstate R̂(0) of the apparatus has not yet been significantly affected. The initial condition D̂sub (tsplit ) for D̂sub (t) is found\nfrom some decomposition of the simple truncated state D̂(tsplit ). To follow the fate of the subensemble Esub , we have\nto solve the equations of motion of section 4. The situation is the same as in section 5, except for the replacement\nof the initial condition D̂(0) by D̂sub (tsplit ). In case the truncation mechanisms of sections 5 and 6 are effective, the\nelements present in the off-diagonal blocks of D̂sub (t) disappear over the short time scale τtrunc , as they did for D̂(t).\nThe state D̂sub (t) is thus dynamically unstable against truncation. Later on, the diagonal blocks that remain after this\n106 The choice of the non-informative prior is straightforward for a finite event space, where it amounts to the homogeneous probability (all events\nhave equal probability). Otherwise, its choice is not unique and can be controversial if approached formally [335, 336, 337].\n107 Do not say it is wheat until it is in the bag and securely tied\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n149\n\nrelaxation will evolve as in section 7, and give rise to ferromagnetic states for M, so that D̂sub (tf ) will eventually reach\nthe form (11.7).\nUnfortunately, the truncation mechanism based on the coupling between S and M is not efficient for all possible\ninitial states D̂sub (tsplit ). We have seen in section 5 that truncation requires a sufficient width in the initial paramagnetic\nprobability distribution PM (m, 0) of the pointer variable, and\n√ that it may fail for “squeezed” initial states of M (§ 5.2.3).\nWhile the full state D̂(tsplit ) involves a width of order 1/ N for PM (m, 0), this property is not necessarily satisfied by\nD̂sub (tsplit ), which is constrained only by the positivity of D̂(tsplit ) − νk D̂sub (tsplit ) for a sizeable νk (§11.2.1). We thus\nfail to prove in the present approach that D̂(t) finally reaches the form (11.7) for an arbitrary subensemble Esub .\nOne reason for this failure lies in the weakness on the constraint set upon D̂sub (tsplit ) by D̂(tsplit ) at the time tsplit .\nTaking below a later value for tsplit will entail more severe constraints on D̂sub (tsplit ) so that the required relaxation will\nalways take place. Moreover, the Curie–Weiss model as it stands was too crude for our present purpose since only a\nP\nsingle variable, the combination m̂ = (1/N) n σ̂z(n) of the pointer observables, enters its dynamics. The irreversible\nprocess that ensures the hierarchic structure of the subensembles is more elaborate than the truncation process of D̂(t)\nand requires dynamics involving many variables.\n11.2.4. Subensemble relaxation of the pointer alone\nLaat me alleen, alleen met al mijn verdriet108\nLyrics by Gerrit den Braber, music by Giovanni Ullu, sung by Rita Hovink\nAs we just saw, the relaxation towards (11.7) of the states describing arbitrary subensembles cannot be achieved\nby the interaction ĤSA , so that we have to rely on the Hamiltonian of the apparatus itself. We also noted that the\ndynamical mechanism responsible for this relaxation cannot work at an early stage. The form of (11.7) suggests to\ndistinguish the subensembles at a late time tsplit such that M, after having been triggered by S, has reached for the full\nensemble E a mixture of the two ferromagnetic states. The time tsplit at which we imagine splitting E into subensembles\nE0k is thus taken at the end of the registration, just before the time tf , so that the new initial state D̂sub (tsplit ) of the\nconsidered dynamical process for an arbitrary subensemble Esub is one element of some decomposition (11.4) of\nD̂(tsplit ) ' D̂(tf ). Note that the irreversibility of the evolution that has led to D̂(tsplit ) prevents us from identifying the\nstate D̂sub (t) at earlier stages of the process, when m has not yet reached mF or −mF . For t > tsplit , D̂sub (t) will be found\nby solving the Liouville–von Neumann equation with the initial condition at t = tsplit . As the registration is achieved\nat the time tsplit , the interaction ĤSA is then supposed to have been switched off, so that the apparatus will relax by\nitself, though its correlations already established with S will be preserved.\nThe decompositions (11.4) of D̂(tf ) are made simpler if we replace, in the expression (11.2), each canonical\nferromagnetic equilibrium state R̂i by a microcanonical state109 ; this is justified for large N. Tracing out the bath,\nwhich reduces D̂ to D̂, we will therefore consider arbitrary decompositions of the analogue for S+M of the state\n(11.3), that is, of\nD̂(tf ) = p↑ r̂↑ ⊗ R̂μ⇑ + p↓ r̂↓ ⊗ R̂μ⇓ ,\n\n(11.8)\n\nwhere r̂↑ = |↑ih↑| and r̂↓ = |↓ih↓|. The two occurring microcanonical states of M are expressed as (with the index μ\nfor microcanonical)\nR̂μ⇑ =\n\n1X\n|mF , ηihmF , η|,\nG η\n\nR̂μ⇓ =\n\n1X\n|−mF , ηih−mF , η|,\nG η\n\n(11.9)\n\n108 Leave me alone, alone with all my sorrows\n109 The proof below is readily extended to our original situation, where (11.8) and (11.9) involve canonical equilibrium states R̂ and R̂ of the\n⇑\n⇓\npointer instead of microcanonical ones. We merely have to imagine that the eigenstates\n|mF , ηi of M which occur in (11.10) denote the eigenvectors\n√\nof m̂ associated with the eigenvalues of m̂ lying in a small interval of width 1/ N around mF . The index η then denotes these various eigenstates.\nEq. (11.8) is replaced by a weighted sum over them, and G again denotes their number, now larger than G(mF ). However, as G(m) behaves as an\nexponential of N, the two weights have the same order of magnitude for large N. The subsequent developments remain valid\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n150\n\nP (n)\n(n)\n(N)\nwhere |m, ηi denote the eigenstates |σ(1)\nz , · · · , σz , · · · , σz i of ĤM , with m = (1/N) n σz ; the index η takes a\nnumber G(m) of values, and the degeneracy G(m) of the levels, expressed by (3.24), is large as an exponential of N;\nfor shorthand we have denoted G(mF ) = G(−mF ) as G.\nThe density matrix D̂(tsplit ) ' D̂(tf ) associated with E has no element outside the large eigenspace m , mF ,\nm , −mF associated with its vanishing eigenvalue. The same property holds for the density operator D̂sub (tsplit )\nassociated with any subensemble Esub . More precisely, as (11.8) is an operator in the 2G-dimensional space spanned\nby the basis |↑i⊗|mF , ηi, |↓i⊗|−mF , ηi, any density operator D̂sub (tsplit ) issued from the decomposition of D̂(tsplit ) = D̂(tf )\nis a linear combination of projections over pure states |Ψ(tsplit )i of the form [71, 330, 338]\n|Ψ(tsplit )i =\n\nX\n\nU↑η |↑i ⊗ |mF , ηi +\n\nη\n\nX\n\nU↓η |↓i ⊗ |−mF , ηi,\n\n(11.10)\n\nη\n\nP\nwith arbitrary coefficients U↑η , U↓η normalized as η ( |U↑η |2 +|U↓η |2 ) = 1. Having split the ensemble E into subensembles after achievement of the registration has introduced a strong constraint on the states D̂sub , since only the components for which m = mF or m = −mF occur. The “cat terms” | ↑ih↓ | ⊗ |mF , ηih−mF , η0 | in |Ψ(tf )ihΨ(tf )|, and their\nhermitean conjugates, describe coherences of S + M, while the diagonal terms include correlations.\nSince any D̂sub is a linear combination of terms |Ψ(t)ihΨ(t)|, our problem amounts to show that |Ψ(t)ihΨ(t)| decays\non a time scale τsub short compared to tf towards an incoherent sum of microcanonical distributions, according to\n|Ψ(t)ihΨ(t)| → q↑ r̂↑ ⊗ R̂μ⇑ + q↓ r̂↓ ⊗ R̂μ⇓ ,\n\nq↑ =\n\nX\nη\n\n|U↑η |2 ,\n\nq↓ =\n\nX\n\n|U↓η |2 .\n\n(11.11)\n\nη\n\nWe will term this decay the subensemble relaxation. It is a generalization to a pair of macroscopic equilibrium\nstates of the microcanonical relaxation process, which was discussed in literature several times and under various\nassumptions; see Ref. [340] for an early review and Refs. [341, 342, 343, 344] for further results. Note that, in each\nsubensemble Esub , the expectation values of the observables of S + M may evolve according to (11.11) on the time\nlapse τsub ; however, they remain constant for the full ensemble since D̂(t) has already reached its stationary value:\nWhen the subensembles Ek of some decomposition (11.4) of E are put back together, the time dependences issued\nfrom (11.11) compensate one another.\nObviously, our simple Curie–Weiss model as defined in section 3 is inappropriate to produce this desired relaxation. Indeed, all the states |↑i⊗|mF , ηi and |↓i⊗|−mF , ηi are eigenstates with the same eigenvalue of both the coupling\nĤSM and the Ising Hamiltonian ĤM , so that ĤSA + ĤM has no effect on |Ψ(t)ihΨ(t)|. Whether S is still coupled to M\nor not at the time tsplit thus makes no difference. Moreover, the coupling ĤMB with the bath was adequate to allow\ndumping of energy from M to B during the registration, whereas we need here transitions\nbetween states |mF , ηi and\n√\n|mF , η0 i with equal energies (or nearly equal energies, within a margin of order 1/ N, for canonical equilibrium 109 ).\nWe must therefore extend the model, by supplementing the original Hamiltonian of subsection 3.2 with weak interactions V̂M which may induce the required transitions among the spins of M without affecting the previous results. As\nthese transitions should not modify m, the perturbation V̂M has the form V̂M = V̂⇑ + V̂⇓ , where V̂⇑ and V̂⇓ act in the\nsubspaces |mF , ηi and |−mF , ηi, respectively, so that V̂⇑ | − mF , ηi = V̂⇓ |mF , ηi = 0.\nIn order to find explicitly the time dependence of |Ψ(t)ihΨ(t)|, we have to specify V̂M . A simple possibility\nconsists in taking V̂⇑ and V̂⇓ as random matrices [257]. This procedure does not describe a stochasticity that would\nbe generated by some environment, but is simply founded as usual on Wigner’s idea that complicated interactions\nwill generate similar properties; averaging thus appears as a means for deriving such generic results through feasible\ncalculations. We shall regard V̂M as the sum of two independent random Hermitean matrices V̂⇑ and V̂⇓ of size G,\nwith a weight proportional to110\n110 The only constraint on V̂ being hermiticity, the maximum entropy criterion yields, as least biased choice of probability distribution [345], the\nM\nGaussian unitary ensemble (11.12), invariant under unitary transformations. Had we constrained V̂M to be invariant under time reversal, that is, to\nbe represented by real symmetric matrices, we would have dealt with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, with a probability distribution invariant\nunder orthogonal transformations; the results would have been the same. We will rely in §11.2.5 and in appendix H on another type of random\nmatrices, which yields a more standard time dependence for the subensemble relaxation\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n151\n\n\u0011#\n2G \u0010 2\n2\nexp − 2 tr V̂⇑ + tr V̂⇓ ,\n∆\n\"\n\n(11.12)\n\nand average |Ψ(t)ihΨ(t)| with the weight (11.12) over the√evolutions generated by the various realizations of V̂M . The\nmatrix elements of V̂M have a very small typical size ∆/ G, where we remind that G is large as an exponential of N.\nThe G energy levels of ĤM + V̂M in the subspace |mF , ηi are now no longer degenerate, and, taking as\n√ origin for the\nenergy E the unperturbed value issued from ĤM , their density obeys Wigner’s semi-circle law (2/π∆2 ) ∆2 − E 2 since\nG \u001d 1. We do not wish the perturbation V̂M to spoil the above analysis of the original Curie–Weiss model which led\nto D̂(tf ); its effect, measured for large G by the parameter ∆, should therefore be sufficiently weak so as to produce a\nwidening ∆ small compared to the fluctuation\nof the energy in the canonical distribution. Since the fluctuation of m̂ in\n√\nthe latter distribution is of order 1/ N, we should take, according to (3.7),\n√\n\n∆\n\nN(J2 + J4 ).\n\n(11.13)\n\nReturning to |Ψ(t)ihΨ(t)|, where we set t = tsplit + t0 so as to take tsplit as an origin of the time t0 , we notice that the\nsystem S behaves as a spectator, so that we need only to study, in the space of M, the time dependence of the operators\nX̂⇑ηη (t0 ) ≡\n\nexp(−iV̂⇑ t0 /~)|mF , ηihmF , η0 | exp(iV̂⇑ t0 /~),\n\n(11.14)\n\nŶ ηη (t0 ) ≡\n\nexp(−iV̂⇑ t0 /~)|mF , ηih−mF , η0 | exp(iV̂⇓ t0 /~),\n\n(11.15)\n\n0\n\n0\n\nand of the operators X̂⇓ηη (t0 ) and Ŷ η η (t0 )† obtained by interchanging ⇑ and ⇓. Because V̂⇑ and V̂⇓ are statistically\n0\nindependent, the evaluation of Ŷ ηη (t0 ) simply involves the separate averages of exp(−iV̂⇑ t0 /~) and of exp(iV̂⇓ t0 /~),\nwhich for symmetry reasons are proportional to the unit operator. We can therefore evaluate the time dependence of\n0\nŶ ηη (t0 ) through the trace\n0\n\nφ(t0 ) ≡\n\n0\n\n1\n2\ntr exp(−iV̂⇑ t0 /~) =\nG\nπ∆2\n\nZ ∆\n\n√\ndE\n\n∆2 − E 2 exp(−iEt0 /~) =\n\n−∆\n\n!\n2τsub\nt0\nJ\n,\n1\nt0\nτsub\n\n(11.16)\n\nwhere we made use of the semi-circle law for the density of eigenvalues recalled above.\nThis expression exhibits the characteristic time τsub associated with the relaxation of the subensembles:\nτsub =\n\n~\n.\n∆\n\n(11.17)\n\nNotice that τsub does not depend on the huge size G of our Hilbert space. We wish τsub to be short compared to\nthe registration time τreg given by (9.9) or (9.10). As N \u001d 1 and γ \u001c 1, the condition (11.13) permits easily a\n√\n0\nvalue of ∆ such that τsub \u001c τreg , i.e., N \u001d ∆/J \u001d γ. From (11.15) and (11.16), we find that Ŷ ηη (t0 ) behaves as\nηη0 0\n0\nηη0\nŶ (t ) = fY (t )Ŷ (0), where\n2τsub\nfY (t ) = φ (t ) =\nt0\n0\n\n2 0\n\n!2\nJ12\n\nt0\nτsub\n\n!\n≈\n∼\n\n!2\n\nt0\n,\n2τsub\n!\n8 \u0012 τsub \u00133 2 t0\nπ\nsin\n−\n,\nπ t0\nτsub 4\n\n\n1 −\n\n(t0 \u001c τsub ),\n(t0 \u001d τsub ).\n\n(11.18)\n\nAccordingly, the off-diagonal blocks of |Ψ(tsplit + t0 )ihΨ(tsplit + t0 )|, which involve both ferromagnetic states mF and\n0\n−mF , decay for t0 \u001d τsub as Eq.

It is thus seen that the coherent contributions Ŷ ηη fade out over the short\ntime τsub .\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n152\n\nThe time dependence of fY (t0 ) includes a slow decrease as 1/t0 3 and oscillations, unusual features for a physical\ndecay. These peculiarities result from the sharp behavior of the level density at E = ±∆. We will show in § 11.2.5\nhow how a more familiar exponential decay comes out from more realistic models.\n0\nTo evaluate X̂⇑ηη (t0 ), we imagine that the two exponentials of (11.14) are expanded in powers of V̂⇑ and that Wick’s\ntheorem is used to express the Gaussian average over (11.12) in terms of the averages V̂ηη0 V̂η0 η = ∆2 /4G. We thus find\n0\na diagrammatic expansion [339, 341] for the matrix elements of X̂⇑ηη (t0 ) in the basis |mF , ηi. Apart from the factor\n0\n(−i)n in /n!n0 ! arising from the expansion of the exponentials, each line of a diagram carries a contraction\n1\nt0 2\n∆2 t 0 2\nt0\n0 V̂η0 η =\nV̂\n=\nηη\n~2\n4~2G 4G τsub\n\n!2\n,\n\n(11.19)\n\nand each summation over an internal index η brings in a factor G. The structure of the contractions (11.19) implies that each index must come in a right-left pair. Hence, for η , η0 , the sole non-vanishing matrix element of\n0\n0\nX̂⇑ηη (t0 ) is hmF , η|X̂⇑ηη (t0 )|mF , η0 i. Among the contributions to this matrix element, the only diagrams that survive\nin the large-G limit are those which involve as many summations over indices η as contractions. This excludes in\nparticular all diagrams containing contractions astride the left and right exponentials of (11.14). The evaluation of\n0\n0\nhmF , η|X̂⇑ηη (t0 )|mF , η0 i thus involves the same factorization as in hmF , η|Ŷ ηη (t0 )| − mF , η0 i, and this simply produces the\n\nfactor [φ(t0 )]2 . We therefore find, for η , η0 , that X̂⇑ηη (t0 ) = φ2 (t0 )X̂⇑ηη (0) tends to 0 just as (11.18).\nFor X̂⇑ηη (t0 ), the pairing of indices shows that the sole non-vanishing elements are hmF , η|X̂⇑ηη (t0 )|mF , ηi, the outcome\nof which does not depend on η, and, for η , η0 , hmF , η0 |X̂⇑ηη (t0 )|mF , η0 i, which depends neither on η nor on η0 . Moreover,\naccording to the definitions (11.9) and (11.14), we note that tr X̂⇑ηη (t0 ) = 1, so that X̂⇑ηη (t0 ) must have the general form\n0\n\n0\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nX̂⇑ηη (t0 ) = fX (t0 ) X̂⇑ηη (0) + 1 − fX (t0 ) R̂μ⇑ .\n\n(11.20)\n\nIn the large-G limit, the same analysis as for hmF , η|X̂⇑ηη (t0 )|mF , η0 i holds for hmF , η|X̂⇑ηη (t0 )|mF , ηi, and we find likewise\nfX (t0 ) = φ2 (t0 ), so that the first term of (11.20) again decays as (11.18). (A direct evaluation of hmF , η0 |X̂⇑ηη (t0 )|mF , η0 i\nfor η , η0 , which contributes to the second term of (11.20), would be tedious since this quantity, small as 1/G, involves\n0\ncorrelations between the two exponentials of (11.14).) Thus, on the time scale τsub , the operators X̂⇑ηη (t0 ) fade out for\nη , η0 and tend to the microcanonical distribution for η = η0 .\n0\n\nLet us resume the above results. Starting from the ensemble E described by the state (11.8), we consider at a time\ntsplit slightly earlier than tf and such that tf − tsplit \u001d τsub , any (real or virtual) subensemble Esub described by a state\nD̂sub (tsplit ) issued from a decomposition of D̂(tsplit ) ' D̂(tf ). In the present model D̂sub evolves according to\nD̂sub (tsplit + t0 ) = φ2 (t0 )D̂sub (tsplit ) + [1 − φ2 (t0 )]D̂split (tf ),\n\n(11.21)\n\nwhere\nD̂split (tf ) = q↑ r̂↑ ⊗ R̂μ⇑ + q↓ r̂↓ ⊗ R̂μ⇓ ,\n\nq↑,↓ = tr D̂split (tsplit )r̂↑,↓ ,\n\n(11.22)\n\nand where φ2 (t0 ), expressed by (11.18), (11.17), decreases over the very short time scale τsub \u001c tf − tsplit . The state of\nany subensemble therefore relaxes rapidly to the expected asymptotic form (11.22), fulfilling the hierarchic structure\nat the final time tf . Truncation and equilibration take place simultaneously.\nThe final result (11.22) shows that S and A remain fully correlated while A evolves. We have thus proven in the\npresent model that the surmise (11.7) is justified for any subensemble, and that the set of subensembles possess at\nthe final time tf the hierarchic structure which removes the quantum ambiguity associated with the splitting of the\nfull ensemble of runs. The solution of the measurement problem thus relies on specific properties of the apparatus,\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n153\n\nespecially of its pointer M. We had already dwelt on the large number of degrees of freedom of M, needed to let\nit reach several possible equilibrium states. Now, we wish coherent states astride these equilibrium states to decay\nrapidly, so that the pointer can yield well-separated indications; the present model shows that this is achieved owing to\nthe macroscopic size of M and to a sufficient complexity of the internal interactions V̂M . Moreover these interactions\nequalize the populations of all levels within each microcanonical equilibrium state.\nNote that the above relaxation is a property of the magnet alone, if we deal with broken invariance in the quantum\nframework. So we momentarily disregard the system S and measurements on it. Consider the perfectly symmetric\nprocess of § 7.3.2 (fig 7.7) which brings a statistical ensemble E of magnets M from the paramagnetic state to the\nquantum mixture R̂M (tf ) = Pdis\nM (m̂, tf )/G(m̂) of both ferromagnetic states. To simplify the discussion we replace the\ndis\ncanonical distribution PM (m, tf ) by a microcanonical distribution located at mF and −mF . The mixed state R̂M (tf ) can\nbe decomposed, as indicated at the end of § 11.1.2, into a weighted sum of projections |ψihψ| onto pure states (notice\nthat Ψ in (11.10) refers not only to M but also to S, that is absent here)\n|ψi =\n\nX\n\n0\nU↑η\n|mF , ηi +\n\nη\n\nX\n\n0\nU↓η\n| − mF , ηi,\n\n(11.23)\n\nη\n\neach of which describes a subensemble of E and contains coherent contributions astride m = mF and m = −mF . Let\nus imagine that such a pure state has been prepared at some initial time. Then, in the present model including random\nP\nP\n0 2 μ\n0 2 μ\ninteractions, it is dynamically unstable and decays into η |U↑η\n| R̂⇑ + η |U↓η\n| R̂⇓ on the time scale τsub . Starting\nfrom |ψihψ| we are left after a while with an incoherent superposition of microcanonical equilibrium states of M.\nContrary to the initial state, this final situation can be interpreted classically as describing individual events, in each\nof which m takes a well-defined value, either mF or −mF . Quantum dynamics thus allows us, at least in the present\nmodel, to by-pass the postulate about the apparatus suggested the end of § 11.1.3. Quantum magnets (and, more\ngenerally, macroscopic quantum systems having several equilibrium states) can just relax rapidly into well-defined\nunique macroscopic states, and in that sense behave as classical magnets (systems), as one would expect.\n11.2.5. Subensemble relaxation in more realistic models\nPeople who understand physics do not write many formulas\nNikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky quoting Niels Bohr\nAs usual in the applications of the random matrix theory, the use of a random interaction V̂M was justified by\nthe expected similitude of the dynamical effects of most interactions, which allows us to average |Ψ(t)ihΨ(t)| over\nV̂M . Nevertheless, although our choice of a Gaussian randomness (11.12) was mathematically sensible and provided\nthe desired result, this choice was artificial. We have noted above that it yields a non-exponential decay (11.18) of\nfY (t0 ) = fX (t0 ), which is not satisfactory. In fact, by assuming that all the matrix elements of V̂⇑ have comparable\nsizes, we have put all the states |mF , ηi on an equal footing and disregarded their structure in terms of the spins σ(n)\nz .\nSuch a V̂⇑ is rather unphysical, as it produces transitions from |mF , ηi to |mF , η0 i that involve flip-flops of many spin\npairs, with the same amplitude as transitions that involve a single flip-flop. (The total spin remains unchanged in these\ndynamics.)\n(n0 )\nA more realistic model should involve, for instance, as interaction V̂⇑ a sum of terms σ̂(n)\n− σ̂+ , which keep m fixed\n(n)\n(N)\nand produce single flip-flops within the set |mF , ηi = |σ(1)\nz , · · · , σz , · · · , σz i. The number of significant elements\n2\nof the G × G matrix V̂⇑ is then of order G rather than G as for Gaussian ensembles. This idea can be implemented\nin a workable model by taking for V̂⇑ and V̂⇓ other types of random matrices. If, for instance, the level density\nassociated with V̂⇑ is Gaussian instead of satisfying the semi-circle law, the relaxation will be exponential. One\npossible realization of this exponential relaxation scenario is achieved via a class of random matrices, where the\ndistribution of eigenvalues is factorized from that of the eigenvectors. This case corresponds to the homogeneous\n(Haar’s) distribution. The above Gaussian ensemble, with the distribution of the eigenvalues satisfying the semi-circle\nlaw, belongs to this class [254]. Appendix H justifies that if the distribution of the eigenvalues is taken to be Gaussian\n(independent from the Haar distribution of the eigenvectors), the relaxation is indeed exponential.\nOne can justify the use of random matrices from a different, open-system perspective. We have assumed till now\nthat the decay (11.21) was due to interactions within the spins of M. Alternatively, a concrete physical mechanism\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n154\n\ninvolving the bath B can efficiently produce the same decay. Instead of being governed by V̂M as above, the evolution\nof |Ψ(t)i is now governed by an interaction V̂MB with the bath. In contrast to the spin-boson interaction ĤMB defined by\n(3.10) which flips the spins of M one by one and which produces the registration, this interaction V̂MB does not affect\nthe energy of M, and thus consists of flip-flops of spin pairs. It gives rise to transitions within the subspaces |mF , ηi or\n|−mF , ηi, which can be described as a quantum collisional process. Successive brief processes take place within M +\nB. Each such “collision” may be produced by one among the various elements k of the bath, which act independently.\nIts effect on M is thus described in the subspaces |mF , ηi and |−mF , ηi by either one of the unitary transformations Û⇑k\nand Û⇓k associated with the element k of B. It is then fully legitimate to treat the effective Hamiltonians for M entering\neach Û⇑k and Û⇓k as random matrices. Their randomness arises here from tracing out the bath.\nThis collisional approach is worked out in Appendix I. It is shown to produce the required decay (11.11) of\n|Ψ(t)ihΨ(t)| through the two effects already described in § 11.2.4: the disappearance of the coherent contributions\nof the marginal density matrix of M, and the microcanonical relaxation. The process is rapid, because the collisions produce transitions between kets having the same energy, and the decay is exponential as expected on physical\ngrounds.\nAltogether (table 1), simple models such as the Curie–Weiss model of section 3 can provide, for the full set E of\nruns of a measurement issued from the initial state (11.1), the final state (11.2) issued from two relaxation processes,\nthe truncation, and the registration which fully correlates the system and the pointer. However, ideal measurements\nrequire a property, less easy to ensure, the hierarchic structure of the subensembles of E, expressed by the special form\n(11.7) of their states, which are constructed from the same building blocks D̂i as the state (11.2) for the full ensemble.\nWe have just seen that more elaborate dynamical models involving suitable interactions within the apparatus must\nbe introduced to establish this property for any subensemble, real or not, issued from a mathematically allowed\ndecomposition of E, and hence for any subensemble of real runs.\nWe have no means to identify, among all possible mathematical decompositions, which subensembles are the\nphysical ones and which are their states at the time tsplit , but their hierarchic structure is warranted by the above dynamical process. Then, if a physical state having a form different from (11.7) happens to occur for some subensemble\nat the time tsplit just before the end of the process, it is dynamically unstable and undergoes a new type of rapid relaxation towards a form (11.7). This mechanism removes the quantum ambiguity in the possible decompositions (11.4)\nof the state D̂(tf ) describing the full ensemble E: all subensembles of real runs will at the final time tf be described by\nstates of the form (11.7), the only physical ones at the end of the process.\n11.3. Emergence of uniqueness and of classical features in measurements\nLuctor et emergo111\nFluctuat nec mergitur112\nDevices of the often flooded Dutch province Zeeland and of the city of Paris\nWe are now in position to tackle the quantum measurement problem within the statistical interpretation of quantum\nmechanics. Through a dynamical analysis based on the Liouville–von Neumann equation, we have proved that, for\nsuitable interactions ensuring the subensemble relaxation, the states D̂sub , which describe S + A for all the real sets of\nruns, reach the hierarchical structure (11.7) at the time tf . We will rely on this essential feature to explain the various\nproperties of ideal measurement, including the uniqueness of outcomes.\n11.3.1.

The preparation (§3.3.3 and §7.3.2) brings the magnetic dot into its\nmetastable paramagnetic state. The truncation eliminates the off-diagonal blocks of the density matrix of S + A describing the full set of measurements. It is governed initially (section 5) by the coupling g between S and M, and it becomes permanent later on owing to two alternative\nmechanisms, either randomness of the S–M coupling (subsection 6.1) or bath-induced decoherence (subsection 6.2). The registration (section 7),\ndefined as the establishment of correlations in the diagonal blocks between the system and the pointer for the full set of runs, accompanies the\ntransition of the dot into one of its stable ferromagnetic states, depending on the diagonal sector of the density matrix. The time scales (subsection\n9.3) satisfy τM;B\ntrunc \u001c τirrev \u001c τreg . In contrast with the previous steps which refer to statistical properties of the full ensemble of runs of the\nmeasurement, the establishment of the hierarchic structure refers to the dynamics of states associated with arbitrary subensembles of runs (§ 11.2.4\nand § 11.2.5). It is governed by a specific type of relaxation, and its time scale is very short, τsub \u001c τreg . The resulting hierarchic structure entails\nthe production of a well defined outcome for each individual run. The last step, the reduction of the state of S+A (§ 11.3.1 and § 11.3.2), does not\ninvolve dynamics but consists in the selection of the indication of the pointer. It allows reading, printing or processing the result. (This should be\ndone not too late, before the stable indication of the pointer is finally erased due to thermal fluctuations, see § 7.3.5.)\n\nP\nthe final state D̂(tf ) = i pi D̂i of S + A issued from D̂(0), for the large set E of runs of the measurement, but also to\nP\nestablish the general form D̂sub (tf ) = i qi D̂i of the final states associated with arbitrary subsets Esub , with coefficients\nqi depending on Esub . Although the complete description of an individual run lies beyond the scope of the statistical\ninterpretation, we have gathered the largest possible information about the outcome of this individual run, through the\nstates D̂sub (tf ) that describe the statistics of all the possible subensembles Esub in which it may be embedded. Owing\nto the macroscopic size of the pointer, the rapid subensemble relaxation has thus eliminated the quantum ambiguity\nof the decompositions (11.4) of D̂(tf )114 .\nWe then note that all the states D̂sub (tf ) contain the same building blocks D̂i , and that when two disjoint subensembles merge, their coefficients qi are additive in the sense given after Eq. (11.7). This additivity property is the same\nas for probabilities in their frequency interpretation (§ 11.2.1 and § 11.2.2). In order to infer from this analogy\nconclusions about individual systems, as can be done in ordinary probability theory, we supplement the statistical\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics (section 10) with the following natural additional principle: If we can ascertain\nthat all possible splittings of a large ensemble E into subensembles give rise to a hierarchic structure, we may regard\nE as a “collective” in the sense of von Mises (§ 11.2.2). In other words, we assume that, if E is large and is endowed\nwith a hierarchical structure, it possesses physical subensembles that involve arbitrary values115 for the coefficients qi ,\nP\nwith qi ≥ 0 and i qi = 1. In particular, in agreement with the condition (i) of § 11.2.2, there exist subensembles of E\nsuch that qi = 1 for a given i (and qi0 = 0 for i0 , i), and among them a maximal subensemble Ei .\n114 Because the states D̂ are generally not pure, the quantum ambiguity of their decompositions is not removed by the dynamics, especially if this\ni\nambiguity occurs at a microscopic level, for instance in case r̂i is a mixed state. This remaining ambiguity has no incidence on the solution of the\nmeasurement problem, since we only need to find for each i a well-defined value for the indication of the pointer\n115 Such an arbitrariness of the coefficients q is obvious for the set of mathematically allowed decompositions of a mixed state D̂. It is exhibited,\ni\nfor instance, by Eq. (11.11), since any state of the form (11.10) can enter (for p↑ , 0, p↓ , 0) a decomposition of the state (11.8) which describes\nthe full ensemble E. However, nothing warrants that a state such as (11.10) describes a physically meaningful subensemble of E\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n156\n\nThis identification of E with a von Mises collective entitles us to interpret the subensemble Ei as the set of individP\nual runs described by the state D̂i , and the coefficient pi in D̂(tf ) = i pi D̂i as the relative frequency of occurrence of\nsuch runs in the large ensemble E. Likewise, the coefficient qi appears as the proportion of runs with outcome D̂i in\nthe subset Esub , as in an ordinary probabilistic process (§ 11.1.2 and § 11.2.2). The concept of quantum state, defined\nas a correspondence between the observables and their expectation values (§ 10.1.4), presents a similitude with the\nconcept of probability distribution, but this similitude is only formal since quantum expectation values cannot be given\nthe same interpretation as in classical probability theory. However, the full description, within the purely quantum\nframework, of ideal measurement processes does produce ordinary probabilities in the frequency interpretation.\nA natural argument has thus allowed us to infer, from the hierarchical structure of the final states for arbitrary\nsubensembles of E, that each individual run has a well-defined outcome. We have therefore explained, at least in the\npresent model and using the above principle, the phenomenon of reduction, that is, the production, in each individual\nP\nrun, of one among the diagonal blocks D̂i of the truncated final density matrix D̂(tf ) = i pi D̂i of S+A, which\ndescribes the whole set E and arises from D̂(0). The possibility of making such a statement about individual processes\nin spite of the irreducibly probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics (in its statistical interpretation) is founded on the\nspecial dynamics of the apparatus, as shown in § 11.2.4.\nSolving models provides the values of the probabilities pi as pi = trS r̂(0)Π̂i . For a large number of runs, the census\nof the proportion of runs for which the apparatus has provided the outcome Ai thus provides partial information about\nthe initial state r̂(0) of S. (In the Curie–Weiss model it yields its diagonal elements.) This fully justifies Born’s rule.\n11.3.2. Reduction and preparations through measurement\nThe solution of the Curie–Weiss model has not only justified the hierarchic structure of the subensembles, but it\nhas also provided the expression of each building block D̂i : The density operator D̂i that describes the outcome of the\nruns belonging to the set Ei is an equilibrium state of S + A, which has the factorized form D̂i = r̂i ⊗ R̂i . The state\nr̂i of S is associated with the eigenvalue si of the tested observable ŝ, while the state R̂i of A is characterized by the\nvalue Ai of the order parameter, taken as a pointer variable.\nThe information needed to partition E into its subsets Ei is embedded in the indication Ai of the pointer. The\nuniqueness of this indication has been explained by the subensemble relaxation116 . The macroscopic size of the\npointer then allows observing, storing or processing its outcome. The complete correlations established between\nP\nS and A by the registration, exhibited in D̂(tf ) =\npi r̂i ⊗ D̂i , entail uniqueness of the outcome si for the tested\n117\nobservable ŝ of S in each run . A filtering of the runs of an ideal measurement, which are tagged by the indication\nAi of the pointer, therefore constitutes a preparation of the system S, performed through the reduction of S + A (as was\nanticipated in § 1.1.4) [31]. Lying initially (for the ensemble E) in the state r̂(0), this system lies, after measurement\nand selection of the subset Ei , in the final prepared state r̂i . In the Curie–Weiss model, this final filtered state is pure,\nr̂↑ = |↑ih↑| or r̂↓ = |↓ih↓| or, shortly, |↑i or |↓i.\nIn this circumstance, quantum mechanics, although irreducibly probabilistic and dealing with ensembles, can\nprovide certainty about ŝ for an individual system S after measurement and selection of the indication of the pointer.\nWhile answering, within the statistical interpretation, Bohr’s modest query “What can we say about...?” [346], an ideal\nmeasurement gives a partial answer to Einstein’s query “What is....?” [23]. The solution of models involving not only\nthe interaction of the microscopic object with a macroscopic apparatus but also appropriate interactions within this\napparatus thus explains the emergence of a well-defined answer for the system S in a single measurement, a property\ninterpreted as the emergence of a “physical reality”. However, although the outcome of each individual process is\nunique, it could not have been predicted. The current statement “the measurement is responsible for the appearance\nof the uniqueness of physical reality” holds only for the considered single system and for the tested observable, and\nonly after measurement with selection of the result.\nLet us stress that, in agreement with the statistical interpretation of quantum “states” (§10.1.4), the state assigned\nto S + A or to S at the end of a single run depends on the ensemble in which this run is embedded, and which is itself\n116 The physical argument of § 11.1.1 turns out to be “not even wrong”. It also turns out that we do not need the additional postulate alluded to at\nof the end of § 11.1.3, owing to realistic interactions which act within the apparatus at the end of the proces, and which need not play a major role\nin the truncation and registration\n117 But of course there are no well-defined results for observables that do not commute with ŝ\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n157\n\nconditioned by our information. Before acknowledging the outcome of the process, we have to regard it as an element\nof the full set E of runs issued from the initial state D̂(0) of Eq (11.1), and we thus assign to S + A the state D̂(tf ) of\nEq. (11.2) (which involves correlations between S and A). After having read the specific outcome Ai , we have learnt\nthat the considered single run belongs to the subset Ei which has emerged from the dynamics, so that we assign to S +\nA the more informative state D̂i (which has the uncorrelated form r̂i ⊗ R̂i ). Predictions about experiments performed\nP\non S after the considered run should therefore be made from the weakly truncated state j Π̂ j r̂(0)Π̂ j if the result is\nnot read, and from the reduced state r̂i = Π̂i r̂(0)Π̂i /pi if the result Ai has been read off and selected.\nWhereas the transformation of the state D̂(0) into D̂(tf ) is a real physical process, reduction from the state D̂(tf )\nto the state D̂i has no dynamical meaning. It is simply an updating of our probabilistic description, allowed by the\nacquisition of the information Ai which characterizes the new narrower ensemble Ei . The state D̂i retains through r̂i\nsome features inherited from the initial state D̂(0), but not all due to irreversibility of truncation and registration, and\nit accounts in addition for the knowledge of Ai . Measurement can thus indeed be regarded as information processing;\nthe amounts of information acquired and lost are characterized by the entropy balance of § 1.2.4.\n11.3.3. Repeatability of ideal measurements\nIt is a bad plowman that quarrels with his ox\nKorean proverb\nA property that allows us to approach physical reality within the statistical interpretation is the repeatability of\nideal measurements118 . Suppose two successive ideal measurements are performed on the same system S, first with\nan apparatus A, then, independently, with a similar apparatus A0 . The second process does not affect A, and generates\nfor S and A0 the same effect as the first one, as exhibited by Eq (11.2). Hence, the initial state\nD̂(0) = r̂(0) ⊗ R̂(0) ⊗ R̂0 (0)\n\n(11.24)\n\nof S + A + A0 becomes at the time tf between the two measurements\nD̂(tf ) =\n\nX\n\npi r̂i ⊗ R̂i ⊗ R̂0 (0),\n\n(11.25)\n\ni\n\nand\nD̂(tf0 ) =\n\nX\n\npi r̂i ⊗ R̂i ⊗ R̂i0\n\n(11.26)\n\ni\n\nat the final time tf0 following the second process. For the whole statistical ensemble E, a complete correlation is\ntherefore exhibited between the two pointers. In an individual process, the second measurement does not affect S. We\ncan even retrodict, from the observation of the value A0i for the pointer of the apparatus A0 , that S lies in the state r̂i\nnot only at the final time tf0 , but already at the time tf , the end of the first measurement.\n11.4. The ingredients of the solution of the measurement problem\nBring vor, was wahr ist;\nschreib’ so, daß es klar ist\nund verficht’s, bis es mit dir gar ist119\nLudwig Boltzmann\nAltogether, as in statistical mechanics [55, 56, 73], qualitatively new features emerge in an ideal measurement\nprocess, with a near certainty. The explanation of the appearance, within the quantum theory, of properties seemingly\n118 It can be shown that the sole property of repeatability implies reduction in the weak sense, that is, reduction of the marginal state of S [52]\n119 Put forward what is true, write it such that it is clear, and fight for it till it is finished with you\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n158\n\nin contradiction with this very theory relies on several ingredients, exhibited by the detailed solution of the Curie–\nWeiss model. (i) The macroscopic size of the apparatus allows the pointer to relax towards one or another among\nsome possible values, within weak statistical or quantum fluctuations; these outcomes remain unchanged for a long\ntime and can be read or processed; the choice of the a priori equivalent alternatives is triggered by the tested system.\n(ii) Statistical considerations help us to disregard unlikely events. (iii) The special dynamics of the process must\nproduce several effects (Table 1). The truncation, initiated by the interaction between the tested system and the\npointer, eliminates the off-diagonal blocks of D̂ which would prevent any classical interpretation. The registration,\ntoo often overlooked in theoretical considerations, which requires a triggering by the system and a dumping of energy\ntowards the bath, creates the needed correlations between the system and the pointer. The registration also lets the\napparatus reach, in the state D̂(t), at large t, a mixture of the possible final states; this paves the way to the process of\n§ 11.2.4, where more elaborate but possibly very small interactions within the apparatus ensure that all subensembles\nreach at the final time the hierarchic structure required for reduction. This last step, together with the principle of\n§ 11.3.1, explains how statements about individual systems and how classical features may emerge from measurement\nprocesses in spite of the quantum oddities (§§ 10.2.1 and 10.2.3) associated with the irreducibly probabilistic nature\nof the theory [10, 11, 31, 48, 52, 58].\nAs the symmetry breaking for phase transitions, a breaking of unitarity takes place, entailing an apparent violation\nof the superposition principle for S + A120 . Here also, there cannot exist any breaking in the strict mathematical sense\nfor a finite apparatus and for finite parameters. Nevertheless, this acknowledgement has no physical relevance: the\napproximations that underlie the effective breaking of unitarity are justified for the evaluation of physically sensible\nquantities.\nHowever, the type of emergence that we acknowledge here is more subtle than in statistical mechanics, although\nboth arise from a change of scale. In the latter case, emergence bore on phenomena that have no microscopic equivalent, such as irreversibility, phase transitions or viscosity. In quantum measurements, it bears on concepts. Quantum\ntheory, which is fundamentally probabilistic, deals with ensembles, but measurements reveal properties of individual systems, a fact that we understand within this very theory. The tested physical quantity, random at the microscopic level, comes out with a well-defined value. Ordinary probabilities, ordinary correlations, emerge from a\nnon-commutative physics, and thus afford a classical interpretation for the outcome of the measurement. Thus, ideal\nmeasurements establish a bridge between the macroscopic scale, with its every day’s life features, and the microscopic scale, giving us access to microscopic quantities presenting unusual quantum features and impossible to grasp\ndirectly121 . In the measurement device we lose track of the non-commutative nature of observables, which constitutes\nthe deep originality of quantum mechanics and which gives rise to its peculiar types of correlations and of probabilities, and we thus recover familiar macroscopic concepts. (The disappearance of non-commuting observables will be\nseen to arise directly from the Heisenberg dynamics in § 13.1.4.)\n12. Lessons from measurement models\nCette leçon vaut bien un fromage, sans doute122\nJean de La Fontaine, Le Corbeau et le Renard\nA microscopic interpretation of the entropy concept has been provided through the elucidation of the irreversibility\nparadox [54, 55, 56, 72]. Likewise, most authors who solve models of quantum measurements (section 2) aim at\nelucidating the measurement problem so as to get insight on the interpretation of quantum mechanics. We gather\nbelow several ideas put forward in this search, using as an illustration the detailed solution of the Curie–Weiss model\npresented above, and we try to draw consequences on the interpretation of quantum physics. These ideas deserve to\nbe taken into account in future works on measurement models.\n\n120 As the tested system interacts with the apparatus, it is not an isolated system, so that the breaking of unitarity in its evolution is trivial\n121 A more artificial link between microscopic and macroscopic scales was established by Bohr [346] – see also [85, 347, 348] – by postulating\nthe classical behavior of the measuring apparatus. Though we consider that the apparatus must be treated as a quantum object, we have noticed\n(§ 11.2.4) that quantum dynamics lets the pointer variable reach some classical features\n122 Surely, this lesson is worth a cheese\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n159\n\n12.1. About the nature of the solutions\nLa Nature est un temple où de vivants piliers\nLaissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles;\nL’homme y passe à travers des forêts de symboles\nQui l’observent avec des regards familiers 123\nCharles Baudelaire, Les fleurs du mal, Correspondances\nThe most important conclusion that can be drawn from the solution of models is that one can reach a full understanding of ideal measurements through standard quantum statistical mechanics. Within a minimalist interpretation\nof quantum mechanics, the sole use of Hamiltonian dynamics is sufficient to explain all the features of ideal measurements. In particular, uniqueness of the outcome of each run and reduction can be derived from the Hamiltonian\ndynamics of the macroscopic pointer alone. Unconventional interpretations are not needed.\n12.1.1. Approximations are needed\nFire could leave ashes behind\nArab proverb\nAs stressed in § 1.2.1, a measurement is an irreversible process, though governed by the reversible von Neumann\nequation of motion for the coupled system S + A. This apparent contradiction cannot be solved with mathematical\nrigor if the compound system S + A is finite and all its observables are under explicit control. As in the solution\nof the irreversibility paradox (§ 1.2.2), some approximations, justified on physical grounds, should be introduced\n[54, 55, 56, 121, 197]. We must accept the approximate nature of theoretical analyses of quantum measurements\n[349].\nFor instance, when solving the Curie–Weiss model, we were led to neglect some contributions, which strictly\nspeaking do not vanish for a finite apparatus A = M + B, but which are very small under the conditions of subsection\n9.4. For the diagonal blocks R̂↑↑ and R̂↓↓ , the situation is the same as for ordinary thermal relaxation processes\n[121, 122, 197]: the invariance under time reversal is broken through the elimination of the bath B, performed by\nkeeping only the lowest order terms in γ and by treating the spectrum of B as continuous (section 4). Correlations\nwithin B and between B and M+S are thus disregarded, and an irreversible nearly exact Fokker–Planck equation [254]\nfor the marginal operators R̂↑↑ and R̂↓↓ thus arises from the exact reversible dynamics. For the off-diagonal blocks R̂↑↓\nand R̂↑↓ , correlations between S and a large number, of order N, of spins of M are also discarded (section 5). Such\ncorrelations are ineffective, except for recurrences; but these recurrences are damped either by a randomness in the\ncoupling between S and M (subsection 6.1) or by the bath (subsection 6.2), at least on accessible time scales. We will\nreturn to this point in § 12.2.3. We also showed that, strictly speaking, false or aborted registrations may occur but\nthat they are very rare (§ 7.3.4 and § 7.3.5).\nMathematically rigorous theorems can be proved in statistical mechanics by going to the thermodynamic limit of\ninfinite systems [156]. In the Curie–Weiss model, the disappearance of R̂↑↓ and R̂↓↑ would become exact in the limit\nwhere N → ∞ first, and then t → ∞. However, in this limit, we lose track of the time scale τtrunc , which tends to 0.\nLikewise, the weak coupling condition γ → 0, needed to justify the elimination of the bath, implies that τreg tends to\n∞. Physically sensible time scales are obtained only without limiting process and at the price of approximations.\n12.1.2. Probabilities are omnipresent\nO Fortuna, imperatrix mundi124\nCarmina Burana\nAlthough the dynamics of S + A is deterministic, randomness occurs in the solution of measurement models\nfor several reasons. On the one hand, quantum physical quantities are blurred due to the non-commutation of the\nobservables which represent them, so that quantum mechanics is irreducibly probabilistic (section 10 and [10, 11, 31,\n123 Nature is a temple where living pillars / Let sometimes emerge confused words;\n\nMan passes there through forests of symbols / Which watch him with familiar glances\n\n124 Oh Fortune, empress of the world\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n160\n\n48, 52, 58]). On the other hand, the large size of the apparatus, needed to ensure registration, does not allow us to\ndescribe it at the microscopic scale; for instance it lies after registration in a thermal equilibrium (or quasi-equilibrium)\nstate. Thus, both conceptually and technically, we are compelled to analyse a quantum measurement by relying on\nthe formalism of quantum statistical mechanics.\nMoreover, as shown in subsection 5.2, some randomness is needed in the initial state of the apparatus. Indeed, for\nsome specific initial pure states, the truncation process may fail, in the same way, for instance, as some exceptional\ninitial configurations of a classical Boltzmann gas with uniform density may produce after some time a configuration\nwith non uniform density. For realistic models of quantum measurements, which are of rising interest for q-bit\nprocessing in quantum information theory, experimental noise and random errors should also be accounted for [350].\nRecognizing thus that a quantum measurement is a process of quantum statistical mechanics has led us to privilege\nthe statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics, in which an assertion is “certain” if its probability is close to one.\nFor instance, the probability of a false registration does not vanish but is small for large N (§ 7.3.3). Still, the statistical\nsolution of the quantum measurement problem does not exclude the existence of a hidden variable theory that would\ndescribe individual measurements, the statistics of which would be given by the probabilistic theory, that is, the\nstandard quantum mechanics; see [303] for a recent review of hidden variable theories.\n12.1.3. Time scales\nDe tijd zal het leren125\nDutch proverb\nUnderstanding a quantum measurement requires mastering the dynamics of the process during its entire duration\n[92]. This is also important for experimental purposes, especially in the control of quantum information. Even when\nthe number of parameters is small, a measurement is a complex process which takes place over several time scales, as\nexhibited by the solution of the Curie–Weiss model (subsection 9.3). There, the truncation time turns out to be much\nshorter than the registration time. This feature arises from the large number of degrees of freedom of the pointer M\n(directly coupled to S) and from the weakness of the interaction between M and B. The large ratio that we find for\nτreg /τtrunc allows us to distinguish in the process a rapid disappearance of the off-diagonal blocks of the density matrix\nof S + A. After that, the registration takes place as if the density matrix of S were diagonal. The registration times are\nalso not the same for quartic or quadratic interactions within M. The final subsensemble relaxation of M, that allows\nreduction (§ 11.2.4), is also rapid owing to the large size of the pointer.\nIn the variant of the Curie–Weiss model with N = 2 (subsection 8.1), the orders of magnitude of the truncation\nand registration times are reversed. A large variety of results have been found in other models for which the dynamics\nwas studied (section 2). This should encourage one to explore the dynamics of other, more and more realistic models.\nHowever, it is essential that such models ensure a crucial property, the dynamical establishment of the hierarchic\nstructure of subensembles (§ 11.2.1).\n12.1.4. May one think in terms of underlying pure states?\nAls de geest uit de fles is,\nkrijg je hem er niet makkelijk weer in126\nDutch proverb\nThe solutions of the Curie–Weiss model and of many other models have relied on the use of density operators. We\nhave argued (§ 10.2.3) that, at least in the statistical interpretation, the non uniqueness of the representations (10.3)\nof mixed states as superpositions of pure states makes the existence of such underlying pure states unlikely. Here\nagain, Ockam’s razor works against such representations, which are not unique and are more complicated than the\nframework of quantum statistical mechanics, and which in general would not permit explicit calculations. Moreover,\nit is experimentally completely unrealistic to assume that the apparatus has been initially prepared in a pure state.\nNevertheless, although pure states are probabilistic entities, it is not a priori wrong to rely on other interpretations\n125 Time will tell\n126 When the genie is out of the bottle, it is not easy to get it in again\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n161\n\nin which they are regarded as more fundamental than density operators [14], and to afford the latter a mere status of\ntechnical tools, used to describe both the initial state and the evolution.\nWe can compare this situation with that of the irreversibility paradox for a gas (§ 1.2.2). In that case, although it\nis technically simpler to tackle the problem in the formalism of statistical mechanics, one may equivalently explain\nthe emergence of irreversibility by regarding the time-dependent density in phase space as a mathematical object\nthat synthesizes the trajectories and the random initial conditions [55, 56]. The dynamics is then accounted for by\nHamilton’s equations instead of the Liouville equation, whereas the statistics bears on the initial conditions. (We\nstressed, however, in § 10.2.3, that although density operators and densities in phase space have a similar status,\nquantum pure states differ conceptually from points in phase space due to their probabilistic nature; see also [55, 56]\nin this context.)\nLikewise, in the Curie–Weiss measurement model, one may theoretically imagine to take as initial state of A a\npure state, S being also in a pure state. Then at all subsequent times S + A lies in pure states unitarily related to one\nanother. However it is impossible in any experiment to prepare A = M + B in a pure state. What can be done is to\nprepare M and B in thermal equilibrium states, at a temperature higher than the Curie temperature for M, lower for\nB. Even if one wishes to stick to pure states, one has to explain generic experiments. As in the classical irreversibility\nproblem, this can be done by weighing the possible initial pure states of A = M + B as in R̂(0), assuming that M is a\ntypical paramagnetic sample and B a typical sample of the phonons at temperature T . This statistical description in\nterms of weighted pure states governed by the Schrödinger equation is technically the same as the above one based\non the density operator D̂(t), governed by the Liouville–von Neumann equation, so that the results obtained above for\nthe full ensemble E of runs are recovered in a statistical sense for most relevant pure states. As regards the expectation\nvalues in the ensemble E of physical quantities (excluding correlations between too many particles), the typical final\npure states are equivalent to D̂(tf ). Very unlikely events will never be observed over reasonable times for most of\nthese pure states (contrary to what happens for the squeezed initial states of M considered in § 5.2.3).\nHowever, it does not seem feasible to transpose to the mere framework of pure states the explanation of reduction\ngiven in section 11, based on the unambiguous splitting of the mixed state D̂(tf ). This splitting is needed to identify\nthe real subsets of runs of the measurement, and it has no equivalent in the context of pure states.\n12.2. About truncation and reduction\nLe diable est dans les détails127\nDe duivel steekt in het detail127\nFrench and Dutch proverb\nWe have encountered two types of disappearance of off-diagonal blocks of the density matrix of S + A, which\nshould carefully be distinguished. On the one hand, the truncation (sections 5 and 6) is the decay of the off-diagonal\nblocks of the density matrix D̂(t), which is issued from the initial state D̂(0), and which characterizes the statistics of\nthe full set E of runs of the measurement. On the other hand, the reduction (section 11) requires the establishment of\nthe hierarchic structure for all the subsets of runs. There we deal with a decay of the off-diagonal blocks of the density\nmatrix D̂sub (t) associated with every possible subensemble Esub of runs; this second type of decay may be effective\nonly at the end of the measurement process.\n12.2.1. The truncation must take place for the compound system S + A\nHet klopt als een bus128\nDutch expression\nIn many approaches, starting from von Neumann [4, 17, 21] the word “collapse” or “reduction” is taken in a weak\nacception, referring to S alone. Such theoretical analyses involve only a proof that, in a basis that diagonalizes the\ntested observable, the off-diagonal blocks of the marginal density matrix r̂(t) of S fade out, but not necessarily those\nof the full density matrix D̂(t) of S + A. In the Curie–Weiss model, this would mean that r̂↑↓ (t) and r̂↓↑ (t), or the\n127 The devil is in the details\n128 It really fits\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n162\n\nexpectation values of the x- and y-components of the spin S, fade out, but that R̂↑↓ (t) and R̂↓↑ (t), which characterize\nthe correlations between the pointer M and these components, do not necessarily disappear.\nLet us show that the presence of non negligible elements in the off-diagonal blocks of the final state D̂(tf ) of S\n+ A is prohibited for ideal measurements. Remember first the distinction between truncation and reduction (§ 1.1.2\nand § 1.3.2). Both terms refer to the compound system S + A, but while the truncation is the disappearance of the\noff-diagonal blocks in the matrix D̂(tf ) that describes the full ensemble E of runs of the measurement, the reduction\nis the assignment of the final state D̂i to a subset Ei of E. More precisely, once the uniqueness of the outcome of each\nrun is ensured (subsections 11.2 and 11.3), one can sort out the runs that have produced the specific indication Ai of\nthe pointer. In each such run, the system S lies in the state r̂i and the apparatus A in the state R̂i , hence S + A lies\nin the state D̂i . Born’s rule implies that the proportion of runs in Ei is pi . Collecting back the subsets Ei into E, we\nP\nfind that this full set must be described by the state i pi D̂i , which is a truncated one. It is therefore essential, when\nsolving a model of ideal measurement, to prove the strong truncation property, for S + A, as we did in sections 5 and\n6, a prerequisite to the proof of reduction. A much more stringent result must thereafter be proven (§ 11.2.1), the\nP\n“hierarchic property” (11.7), according to which the state D̂sub of S+A must have the form i qi D̂i for arbitrary, real\nor virtual, subensembles Esub of E.\nThe weak type of truncation is the mere result of disregarding the off-diagonal correlations that exist between S and\nA. This procedure of tracing out the apparatus has often been considered as a means of circumventing the existence\nof “Schrödinger cats” issued from the superposition principle [32, 33, 199, 200, 201, 202]. However, this tracing\nprocedure as such does not have a direct physical meaning [14, 68]. While satisfactory for the statistical predictions\nP\nabout the final marginal state of S, which has the required form i pi r̂i , the lack of a complete truncation for S +\nA keeps the quantum measurement problem open since the apparatus is left aside. Indeed, the proof of uniqueness\nof § 11.2.4 takes as a starting point the state D̂(tf ) for E where truncation and registration have already taken place,\nand moreover this proof involves only the apparatus. Anyhow, tracing out the apparatus eliminates the correlations\nbetween the system and the indications of the pointer, which are the very essence of a measurement (subsection 11.3).\nWithout them we could not get any information about S. This is why the elimination of the apparatus in a model is\ngenerally considered as a severe weakness of such a model [17], that even led to the commandment “Thou shalt not\ntrace” [33].\nSo indeed, theory and practice are fundamentally related. The elimination of the apparatus in the theory of measurements is no less serious than its elimination in the experiment!\n12.2.2. The truncation is a material phenomenon; the reduction involves both dynamics and “observers”\nWeh! Ich ertrag’ dich nicht129\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe, Faust, part one\nThe truncation of the density matrix of S + A appears in measurement models as an irreversible change, occurring with a nearly unit probability during the dynamical process. It has a material effect on this compound system,\nmodifying its properties as can be checked by subsequent measurements. In the Curie–Weiss model, this effect is the\ndisappearance of correlations between the pointer and the components ŝ x and ŝy of S. Though described statistically\nfor an ensemble, the joint truncation of S + A thus appears as a purely dynamical, real phenomenon.\nThe reduction has a more subtle status. It also relies on a dynamical process governed by the Liouville–von\nNeumann equation (§ 11.2.4), the subensemble relaxation, which takes place by the end of the measurement for any\nsubensemble Esub of E (whereas the truncation took place earlier and for the full ensemble E). Moreover, reduction\nrequires the selection of the subset Ei of runs characterized by the value Ai of the pointer variable (§ 11.3.2). This\nselection, based on a gain of information about A, allows the updating of the state D̂(tf ), which plays the role of a\nprobability distribution for the compound system S + A embedded in the ensemble E, into the state D̂i which refers to\nthe subensemble about which we have collected information. Subsequent experiments performed on this subensemble\nwill be described by D̂i (whereas we should keep D̂(tf ) for experiments performed on the full set E without sorting).\nThe idea of an “observer”, who selects the subset Ei of systems so as to assign to them the density operator D̂i ,\ntherefore underlies the reduction, as it underlies any assignment of probability. However, “observation” is meant here\n129 Beware, I can’t stand you\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n163\n\nas “identification and sorting of runs” through discrimination of the outcomes of the pointer. Such a “reading” does\nnot require any “conscious observer”. The “observer” who selects the runs Ai will in fact, in many experiments,\nbe a macroscopic automatic device triggered by the pointer. An outstanding example is the sophisticated automatic\ntreatment of the information gathered by detectors in particle physics, achieved in order to select the extremely rare\nevents of interest.\n12.2.3. Physical extinction versus mathematical survival of the off-diagonal sectors\nI have not failed.\nI’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work\nThomas A. Edison\nMany works on quantum measurement theory stumble over the following paradox. The evolution of the density matrix D̂(t) of the isolated system S + A is unitary. Hence, if D̂ is written in a representation where the full\nHamiltonian Ĥ is diagonal, each of its matrix elements is proportional to a complex exponential exp(iωt) (where ~ω\nis a difference of eigenvalues of Ĥ), so that its modulus remains constant in time. In the ideal case where the tested\nobservable ŝ commutes with Ĥ, we can imagine writing D̂(t) in a common eigenbasis of ŝ and Ĥ; the moduli of the\nmatrix elements of its off-diagonal block R̂↑↓ (t) are therefore independent of time. Such a basis was used in sections\n5 and 6.1 where the bath played no rôle; in section 6.2, the term ĤMB does not commute with ŝ, and likewise in most\nother models the full Hamiltonian is not diagonalizable in practice. In such a general case, the moduli of the matrix\n†\nelements of R̂↑↓ (t), in a basis where only ŝ is diagonal, may vary, but we can ascertain that the norm Tr R̂↑↓ (t)R̂↑↓\n(t) remains invariant. This mathematically rigorous property seems in glaring contradiction with the physical phenomenon\nof truncation, but both are valid statements, the former being undetectable, the latter being important in practice for\nmeasurements.\nIn which sense are we then allowed to say that the off-diagonal block R̂↑↓ (t) decays? The clue was discussed in\n§ 6.1.2: The physical quantities of interest are weighted sums of matrix elements of D̂, or here of its block R̂↑↓ . For\ninstance, the off-diagonal correlations between ŝ x or ŝy and the pointer variable m̂ are embedded in the characteristic\nfunction (5.14), which reads\nΨ↑↓ (λ, t) ≡ h ŝ− eiλm̂ i = TrA R̂↑↓ (t)eiλm̂ ,\n\n(12.1)\n\nwhere the trace is taken over A = B + M. Likewise, the elimination of the bath B, which is sensible since we cannot\ncontrol B and have no access to its correlations with M and S, produces R̂↑↓ = TrB R̂↑↓ , which contains our whole offdiagonal information, and which is a sum of matrix elements of the full density matrix D̂. We are therefore interested\nonly in weighted sums of complex exponentials, that is, in almost periodic functions (in the sense of Harald Bohr130 ).\nFor a large apparatus, these sums involve a large number of terms, which will usually have incommensurable frequencies. Depending on the model, their large number reflects the large size of the pointer or that of some environment.\nThe situation is the same as for a large set of coupled harmonic oscillators [174, 175, 176, 197, 121, 122], which\nin practice present damping although some exceptional quantities involving a single mode or a few modes oscillate.\nIn § 6.1.2 we have studied a generic situation where the frequencies of the modes are random. The\n√ random almost\nperiodic function F(t) defined by (6.14) then exhibits a decay over a time scale proportional to 1/ N; Poincaré recurrences are not excluded, but occur only after enormous times — not so enormous as for chaotic evolutions but still\nlarge as exp(exp N).\nThe above contradiction is therefore apparent. The off-diagonal blocks cannot vanish in a mathematical sense\nsince their norm is constant. However, all quantities of physical interest in the measurement process combine many\ncomplex exponentials which interfere destructively, so that everything takes place as if R̂↑↓ did vanish at the end of\nthe process. The exact final state of S + A and its reduced final state are thus equivalent with respect to all physically\nreachable quantities in the sense of Jauch [94]. Admittedly, one may imagine some artificial quantities involving few\nexponentials; or one may imagine processes with huge durations. But such irrealistic circumstances are not likely to\nbe encountered by experimentalists in a near future, nor even to be recognized if they would occur.\n130 The mathematician and olympic champion Harald Bohr, younger brother of Niels Bohr, founded the field of almost periodic functions. For a\nrecent discussion of his contributions, see the expository talk “The football player and the infinite series” of H. Boas [351]\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n164\n\nNote that the matrix elements of the marginal state r̂(t) of S, obtained by tracing out the apparatus, are again\nobtained by summing a very large number of matrix elements of D̂(t). We can thus understand that the decay of the\noff-diagonal elements of r̂ is easier to prove than the truncation of the full state of S + A.\n12.2.4. The preferred basis issue\nLieverkoekjes worden niet gebakken131\nDutch saying\nRealistic models must explain why the truncation does not take place in an arbitrary basis but in the specific basis\nin which the tested observable of S is diagonal. This leads to the question of determining which mechanism selects\nthis basis; intuitively, it is the very apparatus that the experimentalist has chosen and, in the Hamiltonian, the form\nof the interaction between S and A. One has, however, to understand precisely for each specific apparatus how the\ndynamics achieve this property. For the Curie–Weiss model and for similar ones, the tested observable is directly\ncoupled through (3.5) with the pointer observable m̂, and the preferred basis problem is readily solved because the\ninitial truncation is a mere result of the form of this coupling and of the large number of degrees of freedom of the\npointer M. The finite expectation values h ŝ x i and h ŝy i in the initial state of S are thereby transformed into correlations\nwith many spins of the pointer, which eventually vanish (sections 5 and 6). Pointer-induced reduction thus takes place,\nas it should, in the eigenbasis of the tested observable.\nWe have also shown (§ 6.2.4) that in this model the suppression of the recurrences by the bath, although a decoherence phenomenon, is piloted by the spin-magnet interaction which selects the decoherence basis. When it is extended\nto a microscopic pointer, the Curie–Weiss model itself exhibits the preferred basis difficulty (§ 8.1.5). In the large N\nmodel, the final subensemble relaxation process (subsection 11.2) ensures that the reduction takes place in the same\nbasis as the truncation. This basis should therefore have been determined by the dynamics at an earlier stage.\nIn other models, a decoherence generated by a random environment would have no reason to select this basis\n[32, 33, 40, 199, 200, 201, 202]. It is therefore essential, in models where truncation and registration are caused by\nsome bath or some environment, to show how the interaction ĤSA determines the basis where these phenomena take\nplace.\n12.2.5. Dephasing or bath-induced decoherence?\nWe reserve here the word “decoherence” to a truncation process generated by a random environment, such as a\nthermal bath. We have just recalled that, in the Curie-Weiss model with large N, the initial truncation is ensured mainly\nby a dephasing effect, produced by the interaction between the system and the pointer; the bath only provides one of\nthe two mechanisms that prevent recurrences from occurring after reduction (subsection 6.2). We have contrasted this\ndirect mechanism with bath-induced decoherence (§ 5.1.2). In particular, our truncation time τtrunc does not depend\non the temperature as does usually a decoherence time, and it is so short that the bath B is not yet effective. Later on,\nthe prohibition of recurrences by the bath in this model is a subtle decoherence process, which involves resonance and\nwhich implies all three objects, the tested spin, the magnet and the bath (§ 6.2.4)\nWe have shown (§ 5.1.2 and § 6.1.2) that more general models with macroscopic pointers can also give rise to\ndirect truncation by the pointer. However, in models involving a microscopic pointer (see subsections 2.1, 2.4.1, 2.5\nand 8.1), the truncation mechanism can only be a bath-induced decoherence [32, 33, 40, 199, 200, 201, 202], and the\noccurrence of a preferred truncation basis is less easy to control.\nAs regards the subensemble relaxation mechanism, which ensures the hierarchical structure and thus allows reduction (section 11), it may either arise from interactions within the pointer itself (§ 11.2.4), or be induced by the bath\n(§ 11.2.5 and appendix I). Although the latter process includes a kind of decoherence or self-decoherence, it presents\nvery specific features associated with the breaking of invariance of the pointer. It involves two sets of levels associated with the two possible indications of the pointer, all at nearly the same energy. The coherences astride the two\nsets of levels rapidly disappear, but during the same time lapse, each set also reaches microcanonical ferromagnetic\nequilibrium.\n131 “I-prefer-this” cookies are not baked, i.e., you won’t get what you want\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n165\n\n12.3. About registration\nJ’évite d’être long, et je deviens obscur132\nNicolas Boileau, L’Art poétique\nIn order to regard a dynamical process as an ideal measurement, we need it to account for registration, a point too\noften overlooked. Indeed, we have seen (section 11) that not only truncation but also registration are prerequisites for\nthe establishment of the uniqueness of the outcome in each individual run. The mechanism that ensures this property\nrelies on the dynamics of the sole macroscopic apparatus and on its bistability; it may therefore be effective only after\nregistration. Of course, registration is also our sole access to the microscopic tested system.\n12.3.1. The pointer must be macroscopic\nIedere keer dat hij het verhaal vertelde, werd de vis groter133\nDutch expression\nLike the truncation, the registration is a material process, which affects the apparatus and creates correlations\nbetween it and the tested system. This change of A must be detectable: We should be able to read, print or process\nthe results registered by the pointer, so that they can be analyzed by “automatic observers”. In the Curie-Weiss model,\nthe apparatus simulates a magnetic memory, and, under the conditions of subsection 9.4, it satisfies these properties\nrequired for registrations (section 7). The apparatus is faithful, since the probability of a wrong registration, in which\nthe distribution P↑↑ (m, τreg ) would be sizeable for negative values of m, is negligible, though it does not vanish in\na mathematical sense. The registration is robust since both ferromagnetic states represented by density operators\nyielding magnetizations located around +mF and −mF are stable against weak perturbations, such as the ones needed\nto read or to process the result.\nThe registration is also permanent. This is an essential feature, not only for experimental purposes but also because\nthe solution of the quantum measurement problem (section 11) requires the state D̂(tf ) to have reached the form (11.2)\nand all the states D̂sub (tf ) the similar form (11.7) for any subensemble. However, this permanence, or rather quasipermanence, may again be achieved only in a physical sense (§ 11.1.1), just as the broken invariance associated with\nphase transitions is only displayed at physical times and not at “truly infinite times” for finite materials. Indeed, in\nthe Curie-Weiss model, thermal fluctuations have some probability to induce in the magnetic dot transitions from one\nferromagnetic state to the other. More generally, information may spontaneously be erased after some delay in any\nfinite registration device, but this delay can be extremely long, sufficiently long for our purposes. For our magnetic\ndot, it behaves as an exponential of N owing to invariance breaking, see Eq. (7.84).\nThe enhancement of the effect of S on A is ensured by the metastability of the initial state of A, and by the\nirreversibility of the process, which leads to a stable final state.\nAll these properties require a macroscopic pointer (§ 1.2.1), and not only a macroscopic apparatus. In principle,\nthe models involving a large bath but a small pointer are therefore unsatisfactory for the aim of describing ideal\nmeasurements. In many models of quantum measurement (section 2), including the Curie-Weiss model for N = 2\n(subsection 8.1), the number of degrees of freedom of the pointer is not large. We have discussed this situation, in\nwhich an ideal measurement can be achieved, but only if the small pointer is coupled at the end of the process to a\nfurther, macroscopic apparatus ensuring amplification and true registration of the signal.\nAltogether the macroscopic pointer behaves in its final state as a classical object which may lie in either one or the\nother of the states characterized within negligible fluctuation by the value Ai of the pointer observable Â. (In the CurieWeiss model, Ai ' ± mF is semiclassical, while si = ±1 is quantal). This crucial point has been established in section\n11. Theoretically, nothing prevents us from imagining that the pointer M lies in a quantum state including coherences\nacross m = mF and −mF . For the full ensemble E (section 7), such a situation does not occur during the slow\nregistration process due to the spin-apparatus interaction which creates complete correlations. For any subensemble\nEsub , coherences might exist near the end of the process, but according to section 11, they would rapidly disappear,\nowing to the large size of M and to suitable weak interactions within the apparatus (§ 11.2.4 and § 11.2.5). The\n132 Avoiding lengths, I become obscure\n133 Every time he told the story, the caught fish became bigger\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n166\n\ncorrelations between the signs of sz and of m produced during the registration, and the uniqueness property (§§ 11.3.1\nand 11.3.2), then separate the two sectors. The large size of the pointer is therefore essential for a complete solution\nof the ideal measurement problem.\n12.3.2. Does the registration involve observers?\nHij stond erbij en keek er naar134\nDutch saying\nWe have seen that truncation does not involve observers. Likewise, conscious observers are irrelevant for the\nregistration, which is a physical process, governed by a Hamiltonian. Once the registration of the outcome has taken\nplace, the correlated values of Ai ' ±mF and si = ±1 take an objective character, since any observer will read the\nsame well-defined indication Ai at each run. “Forgetting” to read off the registered result will not modify it in any\nway. Anyhow, nothing prevents the automatic processing of the registered data, in view of further experiments on the\ntested system (§ 12.2.2).\nWe thus cannot agree with the idealist statement that “the state is a construct of the observer”. Although we\ninterpret the concept of probabilities as a means for making predictions from available data (§ 10.1.4), a state reflects\nreal properties of the physical system acquired through its preparation, within some undetermined effects due to the\nnon-commutative nature of the observables.\n12.3.3. What does “measuring an eigenvalue” mean?\nA measurement process is an experiment which creates in the apparatus an image of some property of the tested\nsystem. From a merely experimental viewpoint alone, one cannot know the observable of S that is actually tested, but\nexperience as well as theoretical arguments based on the form of the interaction Hamiltonian may help to determine\nwhich one. From the observed value Ai of the pointer variable, one can then infer the corresponding eigenvalue si of the\nmeasured operator (that appears in the interaction Hamiltonian), provided the correlation between Ai and si is complete\n(an example of failure is given in § 7.3.3). In the Curie-Weiss model the observed quantity is the magnetization of\nM; we infer from it the eigenvalue of ŝz . The statement of some textbooks “only eigenvalues of an operator can be\nmeasured” refers actually to the pointer values, which are in one-to-one correspondence with the eigenvalues of the\ntested observable provided the process is an ideal measurement. The eigenvalues of an observable as well as the\nquantum state of S are abstract mathematical objects associated with a microscopic probabilistic description, whereas\nthe physical measurement that reveals them indirectly relates to the macroscopic pointer variable.\n12.3.4. Did the registered results preexist in the system?\nAfter the measurement process has taken place and after the outcome of the apparatus has been read, we can assert\nthat the apparatus lies in the state R̂i characterized by the value Ai of the pointer while the system lies in the final\nprojected state r̂i (Eq. (11.2)). We can also determine the weights pi from the statistics of the various outcomes Ai .\nHowever a quantum measurement involves not only a change in A that reflects a property of S, but also a change in\nS (§ 1.1.2). In an ideal measurement the latter change is minimal, but we have to know precisely which parts of the\ninitial state r̂(0) are conserved during the process so as to extract information about it from the registered data.\nConsider first the whole ensemble of runs of the experiment. Together with the theoretical analysis it provides the\nP\nset of final states r̂i and their weights pi . The corresponding marginal density operator i pi r̂i of S is obtained from\nr̂(0) by keeping only the diagonal blocks, the off-diagonal ones being replaced by 0. We thus find a partial statistical\ninformation about the initial state: all probabilistic properties of the tested observable ŝ remain unaffected, as well as\nthose pertaining to observables that commute with ŝ. (The amount of information retained is minimal, see § 1.2.4.)\nSome retrodiction is thus possible, but it is merely statistical and partial.\nConsider now a single run of the measurement, which has provided the result Ai . The fact that S is thereafter in\nthe state r̂i with certainty does not mean that it was initially in the same state. In fact no information about the initial\nstate D̂(0) is provided by reading the result Ai , except for the fact that the expectation value in D̂(0) of the projection\non the corresponding eigenspace of Â does not vanish. For a spin 21 , if we have selected at the end of a single run\n134 He stood there and watched, i.e., he did not attempt to assist\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n167\n\nthe value sz = 1, we can only ascertain that the system was not in the pure state | ↓i at the initial time; otherwise\nits polarization could have been arbitrary. In contrast, a classical measurement may leave the system invariant, in\nwhich case we can retrodict from the observation of Ai that the measured quantity took initially the value si . For an\nindividual quantum measurement, retrodiction is impossible, and devoid of physical meaning, due to the probabilistic\nnature of observables and to the irreversibility of the process. The property “ ŝ takes the value si ” did not preexist the\nprocess. It is only in case all runs provide the outcome Ai that we can tell that S was originally in the state r̂i . One\nshould therefore beware of some realist interpretations in which the value si is supposed to preexist the individual\nmeasurement135 : they do not take properly into account the perturbation brought in by the measurement [31].\n12.4. Ideal measurements and interpretation of quantum mechanics\nAn expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made,\nin a narrow field\nNiels Bohr\nQuantum measurements throw bridges between the microscopic reality, that we grasp through quantum theory,\nand the macroscopic reality, easier to apprehend directly. The images of the microscopic world that we thus get\nappear more “natural” (i.e., more customary) than the counter-intuitive quantum laws, although they emerge from\nthe underlying quantum concepts (subsection 11.3). However, the interpretation of the latter concepts is subject\nto ongoing debate. In particular, as a measurement is a means for gaining information about a physical quantity\npertaining to some state of a system, the meaning of “physical quantity” and of “state” should be made clear.\n12.4.1. The statistical interpretation is sufficient to fully explain measurements\nԼավ է մրջնի գլուխ լինես քան առյուծի պոչ:136\nArmenian proverb\nMany authors treat quantum measurements as irreversible processes of quantum statistical mechanics involving\ninteraction between the tested system and a macroscopic apparatus or a macroscopic environment (section 2). The natural tool in such approaches is the density operator of the system S + A, which can be regarded as representing a state\nin the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics (§ 10.1.4). Implicitly or explicitly, we have relied throughout\nthe present work on this interpretation, resumed in section 10.\nA classical measurement can be regarded as a means to exhibit, through an apparatus A, some pre-existing property of an individual system S. In the statistical interpretation of a quantum measurement, we deal with the joint\nevolution of an ensemble of systems S + A, the outcome of which indirectly reveals only some probabilistic properties of the initial state of S [10, 11, 31, 48, 52, 58]. The ensemble E considered in sections 4–9 encompasses the set of\nall possible processes issued from the original preparation; in section 11, we considered arbitrary subensembles Esub\nof E, just before the final time.Neither these subensembles nor the value si of the tested observable ŝ inferred from the\nobservation of the indication Ai of the pointer did preexist the process, even though we can assert that it is taken by S\nafter an ideal measurement where Ai has been registered and selected.\nA preliminary step in a measurement model is the assignment to the apparatus at the initial time of a density\noperator R̂(0), namely, in the Curie–Weiss model (§ 3.3.2 and § 3.3.3), a paramagnetic state for M and a thermal\nequilibrium state for B. The preparation of this initial state is of the macroscopic type, involving a control of only few\nvariables such as energy. The assignment of a density operator is based, according to the statistical interpretation,\non probabilistic arguments (§ 10.2.2), in particular on the maximum entropy criterion which underlies the choice of\ncanonical distributions. (A preparation of the apparatus through a measurement is excluded, not only because it is\nmacroscopic, but also logically, since the measurement that we wish to explain by a model should not depend on a\npreceding measurement.)\n135 In a hidden variable description that enters discussions of Bell inequalities in the BCHSH setup, one should thus describe the measured\nvariable not as a “predetermined” value set only by the pair of particles (Bell’s original setup) but as depending on the hidden variables of both the\npair and the detector (Bell’s extended setup). See Ref. [154] for a discussion of an assumption needed in that setup\n136 Better to be an ant’s head than a lion’s tail\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n168\n\nThe next stages of the solution, truncation and registration (sections 4 to 7), are mere relaxation processes of\nquantum statistical mechanics, governed by the Liouville–von Neumann equation, which lead the state of S + A from\nD̂(0) to D̂exact (tf ) for the large ensemble E of runs. Approximations justified under the conditions of subsection 9.4\nlet us replace D̂exact (tf ) by D̂(tf ). The breaking of unitarity entailed by this replacement can be understood, in the\ninterpretation of a state as a mapping (10.1) of the observables onto their expectation values, as a restriction of this\nmapping to the “relevant observables” [58]. Indeed, if we disregard the “irrelevant” observables associated with correlations between an inaccessibly large number of particles, which are completely ineffective if no recurrences occur,\nboth states D̂(tf ) and D̂exact (tf ) realize the same correspondence (10.1) for all other, accessible observables Ô. The\nentropy S [D̂(tf )], larger than S [D̂exact (tf )] = S [D̂(0)], (§ 1.2.4 and [72]), enters the framework of the general concept\nof relevant entropies associated with a reduced description from which irrelevant variables have been eliminated [58].\nWithin the informational definition (10.1) of states in the statistical interpretation, we may acknowledge a restriction of information to relevant observables when eliminating either the environment in models for which this\nenvironment induces a decoherence, or the bath B in the Curie–Weiss model (subsection 4.1). In the latter case, the\nstates D̂(t) and D̂(t) ⊗ R̂B (t) (Fig. 3.2) should be regarded as equivalent if we disregard the inaccessible observables\nthat correlate B with M and S.\nStill another equivalence of “states” in the sense of (10.1) will be encountered in § 13.1.5, where the Curie–\nWeiss model is reconsidered in the Heisenberg picture. There the evolution of most off-diagonal observables lets\nthem vanish at the end of the process, so that they become irrelevant. The (time-independent) density matrix and the\nresulting truncated one are therefore equivalent after the time tf , since they carry the same information about the only\nremaining diagonal observables. Note also that, in the statistical interpretation, it is natural to attribute the quantum\nspecificities (§ 10.2.1) to the non commutation of the observables; in the Heisenberg picture, the effective commutation\nat the time tf of those which govern the measurement sheds another light on the emergence of classicality (§ 13.1.4).\nWe have stressed that, in the statistical interpretation, a quantum state does not describe an individual system, but\nan ensemble (§ 10.1.3). The solution D̂(t) of the Liouville von-Neumann equation for S + A describes fully, but in a\nprobabilistic way, a large set E of runs originated from the initial state D̂(0): quantum mechanics treats statistics of\nprocesses, not single processes. However, the solution of the quantum measurement problem requires to distinguish,\nat the end of the process, single runs or at least subensembles Ei of E having yielded the outcome Ai for the pointer. A\nmeasurement is achieved only after reading, collecting, processing or selecting the result of each individual process,\nso as to interpret its results in every day’s language [346]. It is essential to understand how ordinary logic, ordinary\nprobabilities, ordinary correlations, as well as exact statements about individual systems may emerge at our scale\nfrom quantum mechanics in measurement processes, even within the statistical interpretation which is foreign to such\nconcepts. Although D̂(t) appears as an adequate tool to account for truncation and registration, it refers to the full set\nE, and its mere determination is not sufficient to provide information about subsets. The difficulty lies in the quantum\nambiguity of the decomposition of the mixed state D̂(tf ) into states describing subensembles (§ 10.2.3 and § 11.1.3).\nWe have achieved the task of understanding ideal measurements in section 11 by relying on a dynamical relaxation\nmechanism of subensembles, according to which the macroscopic apparatus retains quantum features only over a brief\ndelay. This provides the unambiguous splitting of E into the required subsets Ei .\n12.4.2. Measurement models in other interpretations\nHet kan natuurlijk ook anders137\nDutch expression\nAs shown above, standard quantum mechanics within the statistical interpretation provides a satisfactory explanation of all the properties, including odd ones, of quantum measurement processes. Any other interpretation is of\ncourse admissible insofar as it yields the same probabilistic predictions. However, the statistical interpretation, in\nthe present form or in other forms, as well as alternative equivalent interpretations, is minimalistic. Since it has been\nsufficient to explain the crucial problem of measurement, we are led to leave aside at least those interpretations which\nrequire additional postulates, while keeping the same probabilistic status.\nIn particular, we can eliminate the variants of the “orthodox” Copenhagen interpretation in which it is postulated\nthat two different types of evolution may exist, depending on the circumstances, a Hamiltonian evolution if the system\n137 It can of course also be done differently\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n169\n\nis isolated, and a sudden change producing von Neumann’s reduction and Born’s rule if the system S undergoes an\nideal measurement [4, 195]. We can rule out the second type of evolution, since we have seen in detail (section 11)\nthat the standard Liouville–von Neumann evolution alone, when applied to arbitrary subensembles, is sufficient to\nexplain the reduction. The apparent violation of the superposition principle is understood as the result of suitable\ninteractions within the macroscopic apparatus, together with standard treatments of quantum statistical mechanics. It\nis therefore legitimate to abandon the “postulate of reduction”, in the same way as the old “quantum jumps” have been\nreplaced by transitions governed by quantum electrodynamics. It is also superfluous to postulate the uniqueness of\nthe outcome of individual runs (§ 11.1.3).\nInterpretations based on decoherence by some environment underlie many models (subsection 2.7). The detailed\nstudy of section 11 shows, however, that a proper explanation of reduction requires a special type of decoherence,\nwhich accounts for the bistability (or multistability) of the apparatus (§ 11.2.4). Decoherence models in which a\nspecial mode of the environment is considered as “pointer mode” [33, 32] are unrealistic, since, by definition, the\nenvironment cannot be manipulated or read off. See also the discussion of this issue in [69].\nMany interpretations are motivated by a wish to describe individual systems, and to get rid of statistical ensembles.\nThe consideration of conscious observers was introduced in this prospect. However, the numerous models based on\nthe S + A dynamics show that a measurement is a real dynamical process, in which the system undergoes a physical\ninteraction with the apparatus, which modifies both the system and the apparatus, as can be shown by performing\nsubsequent experiments. The sole role of the observer (who may be replaced by an automatic device) is to select the\noutcome of the pointer after this process is achieved.\nReduction in an individual measurement process has often been regarded as a kind of bifurcation which may lead\nthe single initial state D̂(0) towards several possible outcomes D̂i , a property seemingly at variance with the linearity\nof quantum mechanics. In the interpretation of Bohm and de Broglie [18, 24], such a bifurcation occurs naturally.\nOwing to the introduction of trajectories piloted by the wave function, a one-to-one correspondence exists between\nthe initial and the final point of each possible trajectory; the initial point is governed by a classical probability law\ndetermined by the initial quantum wave function, while the set of trajectories end up as separate bunches, each of\nwhich is associated with an outcome i. Thus, the final subsets Ei reflect pre-existing subsets of E that already existed\nat the initial time. In spite of this qualitative explanation of reduction, the trajectories, which refer to the coupled\nsystem S + A, are so complicated that models relying on them seem out of reach.\nAt the other extreme, the reality of collapse is denied in Everett’s many-worlds interpretation [25, 26]. A measurement is supposed to create several branches in the “relative state”, one of which only being observed, but no\ndynamical mechanism has been proposed to explain this branching.\nIn our approach the density operator (or the wave function) does not represent a real systems, but our knowledge\nthereof. Branching does occur, but only at the classical level, by separating a statistical ensemble into subensembles\nlabelled by the outcome of the pointer, as happens when repeatedly throwing a dice. We may call a “branch”, among\nthe 6 possible ones, the selection of the rolls in which the number 5, for instance, has come up .\nThe same concern, describing individual quantum processes, has led to a search for sub-quantum mechanics\n[20, 31, 134]. Although new viewpoints on measurements might thus emerge, such drastic changes do not seem\nneeded in this context. Justifications should probably be looked for at scales where quantum mechanics would fail,\nhopefully at length scales larger than the Planck scale so as to allow experimental tests.\nOf particular interest in the context of measurements are the information-based interpretations [52, 58, 74, 80, 81,\n316], which are related to the statistical interpretation (§ 10.1.3 and § 10.1.4). Indeed, an apparatus can be regarded\nas a device which processes information about the system S, or rather about the ensemble E to which S belongs. The\ninitial density operator r̂(0), if given, gathers our information about some preliminary preparation of S. During the\nP\nprocess, which leads E to the final truncated state r̂(tf ) = i pi r̂i (Eq. (1.10)), all the off-diagonal information are lost.\nHowever, the correlations created between S and A then allow us to gain indirectly information on S by reading the\noutcome of the pointer, to select the corresponding subensemble Ei , and to update our information about Ei as r̂i . The\namounts of information involved in each step are measured by the entropy balance of § 1.2.4.\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n170\n\n12.4.3. Empiricism versus ontology: within quantum mechanics or beyond?\nEinstein, stop telling God what to do\nNiels Bohr\nThere is no general agreement about the purpose of science [318]138 . Is our task only to explain and predict\nphenomena? Does theoretical physics provide only an imperfect mathematical image of reality? Or is it possible to\nuncover the very nature of things? This old debate, more epistemologic than purely scientific, cannot be skipped since\nit may inflect our research. The question has become more acute with the advent of quantum physics, which deals\nwith a “veiled reality” [318]. Physicists, including the authors of the present article, balance between two extreme\nattitudes, illustrated by Bohr’s pragmatic question [346]: “What can we say about...?” facing Einstein’s ontological\nquestion [23]: “What is...?” The latter position leads one to ask questions about individual systems and not only about\ngeneral properties, to regard quantum mechanics as an incomplete theory and to look for hidden “elements of reality”.\nThis opposition may be illustrated by current discussions about the status of pure states. In the statistical interpretation, there is no conceptual difference between pure and mixed states (§ 10.1.4); both behave as probability\ndistributions and involve the observer. In order to reject the latter, many authors with ontological aspirations afford\npure states a more fundamental status, even though they acknowledge their probabilistic character, a point also criticized by van Kampen [14]. Following von Neumann’s construction of density operators (in analogy to densities in\nphase space of classical statistical mechanics), they regard pure states as building blocks rather than special cases of\nmixed states. In a decomposition (10.3) of a density operator D̂ associated with an ensemble E, they consider that\neach individual system of E has its own ket. In this realist interpretation [31], two types of probabilities are distinguished [14]: “merely quantal” probabilities are interpreted as properties of the individual objects through |φk i, while\nthe weights νk are interpreted as ordinary probabilities associated with our ignorance of the structure of the statistical\nensemble E. Such an interpretation might be sensible if the decomposition (10.3) were unique. We have stressed,\nhowever, its ambiguity (§ 10.2.3 and § 11.1.3); as a consequence, the very collection of pure states |φk i among which\neach individual system is supposed to lie cannot even be imagined. It seems therefore difficult to imagine the existence\nof “underlying pure states” which would carry more “physical reality” than D̂ [324, 329]. The distinction between\nthe two types of probabilities on which decompositions (10.3) rely is artificial and meaningless [10, 11].\nLandau’s approach to mixed states may inspire another attempt to regard a pure state as an intrinsic description of\nan individual system [14, 85]. When two systems initially in pure states interact, correlations are in general established\nbetween them and the marginal state of each one becomes mixed. To identify a pure state, one is led to embed any\nsystem, that has interacted in the past with other ones, within larger and larger systems. Thus, conceptually, the only\nindividual system lying in a pure state would be the whole Universe [211, 213], a hazardous extrapolation [10, 11].\nNot to mention the introduction in quantum mechanics of a hypothetic multiverse [25, 352].\nSuch considerations illustrate the kind of difficulties to be faced in a search for realist interpretations, a search\nwhich, however, is legitimate since purely operational interpretations present only a blurred image of the microscopic\nreality and since one may long for a description that would uncover hidden faces of Nature [318]. Among the proposed\nrealist interpretations, one should distinguish those which provide exactly the same outcomes as the conventional\nquantum mechanics, and that can therefore neither be verified nor falsified. They have been extensively reviewed\n[17, 19, 31, 36, 214, 216, 217, 303] (see also references in § 1.1.1), and we discussed above some of them in connection\nwith models of measurements. Many involve hidden variables of various kinds (such as Bohm and de Broglie’s\nbunches of trajectories or such as stochastic backgrounds) or hidden structures (such as consistent histories, see\nsubsection 2.9).\nOther approaches attempt to go “beyond the quantum”. They resort, for instance, to stochastic electrodynamics\n[134, 135, 136, 137], to quantum Langevin equations [31], to nonlinear corrections to quantum mechanics such as in\nthe GRW approach [17, 90, 215], or to speculations about quantum gravitation [353]. The sole issue issue to close the\nEinstein–Bohr debate in such fields is a search for testable specific predictions [23, 346].\nFor the time being, empirical approaches appear satisfactory “for all practical purposes” [354]. The statistical\ninterpretation, either in the form put forward by Blokhintsev [10, 11] and Ballentine [9, 48] or in the form presented\nabove, is empirical and minimalist: It regards quantum mechanics only as a means for deriving predictions from\n138 The present authors do not regard science as having a unique purpose\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n171\n\navailable data. It is related to partly subjective interpretations that focus on information [316], since information is\nakin to probability. We have seen (section 11) that, although the statistical interpretation is irreducibly probabilistic,\ninvolving both the system (as regards the observables and their evolution) and the observers (as regards the state),\nalthough it only deals with statistical ensembles, it suffices in conjunction with dynamics to account for individual\nbehaviours in ideal measurements. The same epistemological attitude is shared by phenomenological-minded people,\nand is advocated, for instance, by Park [28], van Kampen [14] and de Muynck [31]. It can be viewed as a common\nground for all physicists, as stressed by Laloë [34], whose “correlation interpretation” emphasizes predictions as correlations between successive experiments. A more extreme philosophical position, the rejection of any interpretation,\nis even defended by Fuchs and Peres in [355]. According to such positions, quantum theory has the modest task of\naccounting for the statistics of results of experiments or of predicting them. It deals with what we know about reality,\nand does not claim to unveil an underlying reality per se139 . Quantum theory does not make any statement about going\nthrough both slits or not; As such it can be considered as incomplete. Bohr himself shared [346] this conception when\nhe said (see [347, 348] for a list of Bohr’s quotations): “There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract quantum\nphysical description. It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is. Physics concerns what\nwe can say about nature.”\n13. What next?\n\nԱյս ապուրը դեռ շատ ջուր կքաշի:140\nIl va couler encore beaucoup d’eau sous les ponts141\nEr zal nog heel wat water door de Rijn moeten142\nArmenian, French and Dutch proverbs\nMuch can still be learnt from models, even about the ideal quantum measurements on which we have focused.\nVarious features of measurements and their incidence on interpretations of quantum mechanics have been explained\nby the many models reviewed in section 2. However, the treatments based on quantum statistical mechanics provide,\nas final state describing the outcome of a large set of runs of the measurement, a mixed state. Such a state cannot be\ndecomposed unambiguously into components that would describe subsets of runs (§ 11.1.3), so that a further study\nwas required to explain the uniqueness of the outcome of each run. A dynamical mechanism that achieves this task\nhas been proposed (§§ 11.2.4 and 11.2.5 and appendices H and I). Adapting it to further models should demonstrate\nthe generality of such a solution of the measurement problem.\nAlternative approaches should also be enlightening. We suggest some paths below.\n13.1. Understanding ideal measurements in the Heisenberg picture\nNou begrijp ik er helemaal niets meer van143\nDutch expression\nSome insight can be gained by implementing the dynamics of the measurement process in the Heisenberg picture\n(§ 10.1.2) rather than in the more familiar Schrödinger picture. Both pictures are technically equivalent but the\nHeisenberg picture will provide additional understanding. It is then the observables Ô(t, t0 ) which evolve, in terms of\neither the running time t or of the reference time t0 . By taking t0 as the initial time t0 = 0, an observable Ô(t, t0 ) is\ngoverned for an isolated system by the Heisenberg equation\n\ni~\n\ndÔ(t, 0)\n= [Ô(t, 0), Ĥ]\ndt\n\n(13.1)\n\n139 This point may be illustrated on the double slit experiment. While the particle-wave duality allows to imagine that electrons or photons “go\nthrough both slits simultaneously”, some authors find it hard to accept this for large objects such as bucky balls [356] or viruses [357]\n140 Preparing this porridge still requires much water\n141 Much water will still flow under the bridges\n142 Quite some water will still have to flow through the Rhine river\n143 Now I don’t understand anything of it anymore\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n172\n\nwith the initial condition Ô(0, 0) = Ô, while the states assigned at the reference time t0 = 0 remain constant. This\nformulation presents a conceptual advantage; it clearly dissociates two features of quantum mechanics, which in\nthe Schrödinger picture are merged within the time-dependent density operator. Here, the deterministic evolution is\ncarried by the observables, which represent random physical quantities; on the other hand, our whole probabilistic\ninformation about these quantities is embedded in the time-independent density operator144 .\nWe can thus account for the dynamics of a system in a general way, without having to specify its probabilistic\ndescription in the particular situation we wish to describe. The use of the Heisenberg picture has therefore an incidence\non the interpretation of quantum mechanics. Whereas the Schrödinger picture only allows us to describe dynamics of\nthe statistical ensemble represented by the density operator, we can regard the equation of motion (13.1) as pertaining\nto an individual system145 . It is only when evaluating expectation values as tr[D̂Ô(t, 0)] that we have to embed the\nstudied system in a statistical ensemble.\nMoreover, when a measurement is described in the Schrödinger picture, the density operator of S + A undergoes\ntwo types of changes, the time dependence from D̂(0) to D̂(tf ), and the restriction to D̂i if the outcome Ai is selected.\nThe temptation of attributing the latter change to some kind of dynamics will be eluded in the Heisenberg picture,\nwhere only the observables vary in time.\nLet us sketch how the Curie–Weiss model might be tackled in the Heisenberg picture.\n13.1.1. Dynamical equations\nRock around the clock tonight\nWritten by Max C. Freedman and James E. Myers, performed by Bill Haley and His Comets\nThe equations of motion (13.1) which couple the observables to one another have the same form as the Liouville–\nvon Neumann equation apart from a sign change and from the boundary conditions. Thus, their analysis follows the\nsame steps as in section 4. Elimination of the bath takes place by solving at order γ the equations (13.1) for the bath\nobservables B̂(n)\na (t, 0), inserting the result into the equations for the observables of S + M and averaging over the state\nR̂B of B; this provides integro-differential equations that couple the observables ŝa (t, 0) of S and those σ̂a (t, 0) of M\n(a = x, y or z). The conservation of ŝz implies, instead of the decoupling between the four blocks ↑↑, ↓↓, ↑↓, ↓↑ of the\nSchrödinger density matrix, the decoupling between four sets of observables, the diagonal observables proportional\nto Π̂↑ ≡ 21 (1 + ŝz ) and Π̂↓ ≡ 12 (1 − ŝz ), and the the off-diagonal observables proportional to ŝ− and ŝ+ , respectively.\nFinally the symmetry between the various spins of M allows us again to deal only with m̂, so that the dynamics bears\non the observables Π̂↑ f (m̂), Π̂↓ f (m̂), ŝ− f (m̂) and ŝ+ f (m̂), coupled within each sector.\n13.1.2. Dynamics of the off-diagonal observables\nEn spreid en sluit146\nDutch instruction in swimming lessons\nThe evolution (13.1) of the off-diagonal observables generated over very short times t \u001c τrecur = π~/2g by\nĤSA = −Ng ŝz m̂ (section 5) is expressed by\nŝ− (t) = ŝ− exp\n\n2iNgm̂t\n,\n~\n\nm̂(t) = m̂.\n\n(13.2)\n\nInstead of the initial truncation exhibited in the Schrödinger picture, we find here a rapid oscillation, which will entail\na damping after averaging over the canonical paramagnetic state of M.\nP\nThe suppression of recurrences through the non-identical couplings of subsection 6.1 replaces Ngm̂ by n (g +\nδgm )σ̂z(n) in (13.2), a replacement which after averaging over most states will produce damping. The bath-induced\n144 We use the term “observables” in the sense of “operator-valued random physical quantities” (§ 10.1.1), not of “outcomes of observations”. The\nlatter quantities (frequencies of occurrence, expectation values, variances) are joint properties (10.1) of “states” (i. e., density operators playing the\nrole of quantum probabilities) and observables\n145 As understood, in the statistical interpretation, to belong to an ensemble of identically prepared members\n146 And open and close (the legs)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n173\n\nmechanism of subsection 6.2 introduces, both in m̂(t) and in the right side of (13.2), observables pertaining to the\nbath which are regarded as unreachable. Tracing out B then produces the damping of recurrences for the off-diagonal\nobservables.\nWe have shown (§§ 11.2.4 and 11.2.5) that reduction can result from a decoherence produced by a random interaction within M or by a collisional process. In the Heisenberg picture, the result is again the decay towards 0 of the\noff-diagonal observables |↑ih↓| ⊗ |mF , ηih−mF , η0 | and |↓ih↑| ⊗ |−mF , ηihmF , η0 |.\n13.1.3. Establishment of system–apparatus correlations\nՋորին յոթը գետում լողալ գիտի, բայց ջուր տեսնելիս բոլորը մոռանում է:147\n\nArmenian proverb\nThe evolution of the diagonal observables in the Heisenberg picture is analogous to the registration of section\n7, but it is represented by more general equations than in the Schrödinger picture. Indeed, denoting by δm̂,m the\nprojection operator on the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue m of m̂, we now have in the sector ↑↑ to look\nat the dynamics of the time-dependent observables Π̂↑ δm̂,m (t, 0), instead of the dynamics of their expectation values\nPdis\n↑↑ (m, t) in the specific state D̂(0) of S + M as in section 7. The solution of the equations of motion has the form\nΠ̂↑ δm̂,m (tf , 0) =\n\nX\n\nK↑ (m, m0 )Π̂↑ δm̂,m0 .\n\n(13.3)\n\nm0\n\nThe kernel K↑ (m, m0 ) represents the transition probability of the random order parameter m̂ from its eigenvalue m0 at\nthe time 0 to its eigenvalue m at the time tf , under the effect of the bath and of a field +g. It is obtained by taking\nthe long-time limit of the Green’s function defined by Eq. (7.58), and we infer its properties from the outcomes of\nsection 7. As m0 is arbitrary, we must deal here with a bifurcation (as in subsection 7.3). For m0 larger than some\nnegative\nthreshold, K↑ (m, m0 ) is concentrated near m ' +mF ; this will occur in particular if m0 is small, of order\n√\n1/ N. However, if m0 is negative with sufficiently large |m0 |, it will be sent towards m = −mF . Likewise, K↓ (m, m0 ) is\nconcentrated around m ' −mF if |m0 | is sufficiently small (or if m0 is negative), but around m ' +mF if m0 is positive\nand sufficiently large. The complete correlations required for the process to be a measurement will be created only\nafter averaging over a state of the pointer concentrated around m0 = 0.\nAt later times, around tf , the process of § 11.2.4 produces the irreversible decay of the diagonal observables\n| ↑ih↑ | ⊗ |mF , ηihmF , η0 | and | ↓ih↓ | ⊗ |−mF , ηih−mF , η0 | towards δηη0 R̂μ⇑ and δηη0 R̂μ⇓ , respectively. Notice that while the\ninitial observables involve here the full set σ̂(n)\nz , their evolution narrows this set, leading it only towards the projection\noperators on m̂ = mF and m̂ = −mF .\n13.1.4. Fate of observables at the final time\nCarpe diem148\nRoman proverb\nPhysical data come out in the form tr D̂Heis Ô(t, 0) where D̂Heis = D̂Schr (0) = r̂ ⊗ R̂ is time-independent, namely\njust the initial state in the Schrödinger picture. The success of an ideal measurement process now appears as the joint\nresult of the algebraic properties that result in the expressions of the time-dependent observables, and of some\n√ specific\nproperties of the initial preparation of the apparatus embedded in R̂(0). On the one hand, the width in 1/ N of the\ninitial paramagnetic distribution Pdis\nM (m, 0) is sufficiently large so that the oscillations (13.2) of ŝ− (t) are numerous\nand interfere destructively on the time scale τtrunc . On the other hand, it is sufficiently narrow so as to avoid wrong\nHeis\n,\nregistrations: The final probability distribution Pdis\n↑↑ (m, tf ) for the pointer is the expectation value of (13.3) over D̂\n0\ndis\nand the concentration near the origin of m̂ = m in R̂(0) entails the concentration near +mF of P↑↑ (m, tf ).\n147 The mule can swim over seven rivers, but as soon as it sees the water it forgets everything\n148 Seize the day\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n174\n\nSome intuition about ideal measurements may be gained by acknowledging the decay of the off-diagonal observables during the process and their effective disappearance149 after the time tf . The evolution of the diagonal\nobservables also implies that, under the considered circumstances, only the eigenspaces of m̂ associated with eigenvalues close to mF and −mF survive at tf . The only observables remaining at the end of the process, Π↑ δm̂,m (tf , 0)\nwith m close to mF expressed by (Eq b) and Π̂↓ δm̂,m (tf , 0) with m close to −mF , belong to an abelian algebra. It is\ntherefore natural to regard them as ordinary random variables governed by standard probabilities, and to use daily\nreasoning which allows statements about individual events. The singular features of quantum mechanics which arose\nfrom non-commutativity (§ 10.2.1) can be disregarded. The emergence of classicality in measurement processes now\nappears as a property of the Heisenberg dynamics of the observables.\n13.1.5. Truncation\nEn toen kwam een olifant met een hele grote snuit\nEn die blies het verhaaltje uit150\nThe ending of Hen Straver’s fairy tales\nWe now turn to the states describing the ensemble E of runs and its subensembles. Remember that in the statistical\ninterpretation and in the Heisenberg picture, a “state” is a time-independent mathematical object that accounts for\nour information about the evolving observables (§ 10.1.4). Equivalently, the density operator gathers the expectation\nvalues of all observables at any time. The assignment of a density matrix D̂Heis to the whole set E of runs of the\nmeasurement relies on information acquired before the interaction process (i.e., the measurement) and embedded\nin the states r̂, R̂M and R̂B of S, M and B. These information allow us to describe the statistics of the whole process\nbetween the times 0 and tf through the equations of motion (13.1) and the density operator D̂Heis = r̂(0)⊗ R̂M (0)⊗ R̂B (0)\ndescribing the set E.\nHowever, the vanishing at tf of the off-diagonal observables (at least of all accessible ones) entails that their expectation values vanish, not only for the full set E of runs of the measurement but also for any subset. The information\nabout them, that was embedded at the beginning of the process in the off-diagonal blocks of D̂Heis , have been irremediably lost at the end, so that these off-diagonal blocks become irrelevant after measurement. For the whole ensemble\nE, and for any probabilistic prediction at times t > tf , it makes no difference to replace the state D̂Heis by the sum of\nits diagonal blocks according to\nD̂Heis 7→ D̂Heis\ntrunc =\n\nX\n\npi D̂Heis\n,\ni\n\nD̂Heis\n= Π̂i r̂(0)Π̂i ⊗ R̂M (0) ⊗ R̂B (0),\ni\n\n(i =↑, ↓).\n\n(13.4)\n\ni\n\nThis reasoning sheds a new light on the interpretation of truncation, which in the Schrödinger picture appeared as the\nresult of an irreversible evolution of the state. In the present Heisenberg picture, truncation comes out as the mere\nreplacement (13.4), which is nothing but an innocuous and convenient elimination of those parts of the state D̂Heis\nwhich have become irrelevant, because the corresponding observables have disappeared during the measurement\nprocess.\n13.1.6. Reduction\nJoue de veau braisée, couronnée de foie gras poêlé, réduction de Pedro Ximénez151\nRecipe by the chef Alonso Ortiz\nThe argument given at the end of § 13.1.2 then allows us to assign states to the subensembles of E which can\nbe distinguished at the time tf , after the observables have achieved their evolution and after decoupling of S and A.\nHere, however, the states, which do not depend on time, can be directly constructed from D̂Heis or from the equivalent\n149 In fact, the disappearance of the off-diagonal observables is approximate for finite N and is not complete: We disregard the inaccessible\nobservables, whether they belong to the bath or they are associated with correlations of a macroscopic number of particles. The suppression of all\nthe accessible off-diagonal observables relies on the mechanism of § 11.2.4, itself based on the concentration of m̂ around ±mF\n150 And then came an elephant with a very big trunk, and it blew the story to an end\n151 Braised veal cheek, topping of foie gras, reduction of sweet sherry\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n175\n\nexpression (13.4). The vanishing of the off-diagonal observables themselves simplifies the discussion since we can\nalways eliminate the off-diagonal blocks of a state associated with any subensemble. The diagonal observables display\nthe same correlations between the system and the pointer as in (13.4), so that any subset of runs of the measurement\ncan be represented by the state\nD̂Heis\nsub =\n\nX\n\nqi D̂Heis\n.\ni\n\n(13.5)\n\ni\n\nwhich is the basis for all predictions about the considered subensemble at times later than tf . (Note that the inclusion\nof elements in the off-diagonal blocks of (13.5) would not change anything since there are no surviving observables\nin these blocks.)\nThe uniqueness of the outcome of each individual run comes out from (13.5) through the same argument as in\n§ 11.3.1. A well-defined indication i of the pointer is the additional piece of information that allows us to assign to\nthe system S + A, which then belongs to the subensemble Ei , the state D̂Heis\n. Retaining only one diagonal block of\ni\nHeis\n152\nD̂\nin (13.4) amounts to upgrade our probabilistic description .\nThe specific features of the Heisenberg representation were already employed in literature for arguing that this\nrepresentation (in contrast to that by Schrödinger) has advantages in explaining the features of quantum measurements [358, 359, 360]. In particular, Rubin argued that obstacles preventing a successful application of the Everett\ninterpretation to quantum measurements are absent (or at least weakened) in the Heisenberg representation [359, 360].\nCertain aspects of the analysis by Rubin do not depend on the assumed Everett interpretation and overlap with the\npresentation above (that does not assume this interpretation). Blanchard, Lugiewicz and Olkiewicz employed the\ndecoherence physics within the Heisenberg representation for showing that it accounts more naturally (as compared\nto the Schrödinger representation) for the emergence of classical features in quantum measurements [358]. Their\napproach is phenomenological (and shares the criticisms we discussed in section 2.2), but the idea of an emergent\nAbelian (classical) algebra again overlaps with the preliminary results reported above. The emergent Abelian algebra\nis also the main subject of the works by Sewell [160, 161, 162] and Requardt [69] that we already reviewed in section\n2.4.3. In particular, Requardt explains that closely related ideas were already expressed by von Neumann and van\nKampen (see references in [69]).\nAs shown by this reconsideration of the Curie–Weiss model, the Heisenberg picture enlightens the truncation,\nreduction and registration processes, by exhibiting them as a purely dynamical phenomena and by explaining their\ngenerality. Although mathematically equivalent to the Schrödinger picture, it suggests more transparent interpretations, owing to a separate description of the dynamics of quantum systems and of our probabilistic knowledge about\nthem. A better insight on other models of measurement should therefore be afforded by their treatment in the Heisenberg picture.\n13.2. Other types of measurements\nCorruptissima republica plurimae leges153\nTacitus\nWe have only dealt in this article with ideal quantum measurements, in which information about the initial state\nof the tested system S is displayed by the apparatus at some later time, and in which the final state of the system\nS is obtained by projection. Other realistic setups, e.g. of particle detectors or of avalanche processes, deserve\nto be studied through models. Measurements of a more elaborate type, in which some quantum property of S is\ncontinuously followed in time, are now being performed owing to experimental progress [307, 308, 361, 362, 319].\n152 In the Schrödinger picture, the expectation value of any (time-independent) observable for the subensemble E was found from the state D̂\ni\ni\nof Eq. (11.21). Here, it is obtained from the evolution (13.3) and the state D̂Heis\nof Eq (13.4). The state D̂i results from D̂Heis\nby integrating the\ni\ni\nLiouville–von Neumann equation from t = 0 to tf\n153 The greater the degeneration of the republic, the more of its laws\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n176\n\nFor instance, non-destructive (thus non-ideal) repeated observations of photons allow the study of quantum jumps\n[362], and quantum-limited measurements, in which a mesoscopic detector accumulates information progressively\n[363], are of interest to optimize the efficiency of the processing of q-bits. Quantum measurements are by now\nemployed for designing feedback control processes [319, 364], a task that in the classical domain is routinely done\nvia classical measurements.\nSuch experiments seem to reveal properties of individual systems, in apparent contradiction with the statistical\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics. However, as in ideal measurements, repeated observations of the above type on\nidentically prepared systems give different results, so that they do not give access to trajectories in the space of the\ntested variables, but only to autocorrelation functions presenting quantum fluctuations. It seems timely, not only for\nconceptual purposes but to help the development of realistic experiments, to work out further models, in particular\nfor such quantum measurements in which the whole history of the process is used to gather information. In this\ncontext we should mention the so-called weak measurements [365] that (in a sense) minimize the back-action of the\nmeasurement device on the measured system, and – although they have certain counterintuitive features – can reveal\nthe analogues of classical concepts in quantum mechanics; e.g., state determination with the minimal disturbance,\nclassical causality [366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371], and even mapping out of the complete wave function [372] or of\nthe average trajectories of single photons in a double-slit experiment [373].\nApart from such foreseeable research works, it seems desirable to make educational progress by taking into account the insights provided by the solution of models of quantum measurement processes. The need of quantum\nstatistical mechanics to explain these processes, stressed all along this paper, and the central role that they play in the\nunderstanding of quantum phenomena, invite us to a reformation of teaching at the introductory level. The statistical\ninterpretation, as sketched in subsection 10.1, is in keeping with the analysis of measurements. Why not introduce the\nconcepts and bases of quantum mechanics within its framework. This “minimal” interpretation seems more easily assimilable by students than the traditional approaches. It thus appears desirable to foster the elaboration of new courses\nand of new textbooks, which should hopefully preserve the forthcoming generations from bewilderment when being\nfirst exposed to quantum physics...and even later!\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Bernard d’Espagnat, Franck Laloë, Michel Le Bellac and Roland Omnès for having urged us to stress the\nexplanation of uniqueness, and especially F.

We wish these memory effects to bear only on the bath, so as to have a short\ncharacteristic time. However the initial state which enters (A.4) involves not only R̂B (0) but also D̂ (0), so that a\nmere insertion of (A.4) into (A.3) would let D̂ (t) keep an undesirable memory of D̂ (0). We solve this difficulty by\nre-expressing perturbatively D̂ (0) in terms of D̂ (t). To this aim we note that the trace of (A.4) over B provides\nU0† (t) D̂ (t) Û0 (t) = D̂ (0) + O (γ) .\n\n(A.5)\n\nWe have used the facts that the expectation value over R̂B (0) of an odd number of operators B̂(n)\na vanishes, and that\n√\neach B̂(n)\nγ.

Using the expressions (3.10) and (A.2) for ĤMB and ĤMB (t0 ), denoting\nthe memory time t − t0 as u, and introducing the operators σ̂(n)\na (u) defined by (4.4), we finally find the differential\nequation (4.5) for D̂(t).\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n178\n\nB.

The above complete formula\nexhibits some contributions that become exponentially small for sufficiently large t. Such contributions are essential\nto ensure the behavior (D.9) of B for t \u001c 1/Γ̃, and also its behavior for t \u001c ~/2πT , but can be neglected otherwise.\nMoreover, we have ~Γ̃ \u001d T and Γ̃ \u001d Ω; hence, within exponentially small corrections, the third term of (D.13)\nreduces, for t \u001d 1/Γ̃, to −Ω2 sin(2Ωt)/8Γ̃2 and is therefore negligible compared to the first two terms. In the first\nterm of (D.13), the Debye cutoff is irrelevant, but it is needed in the second term to ensure convergence of the series.\nRestoring our exponential cutoff, we can write this series as\n∞\n\n1 X n\ne−bn ,\n2π n=1 n2 + a2\n\na≡\n\n~Ω\n1,\n2πT\n\nb≡\n\n2πT\n1,\n~Γ\n\n(D.15)\n\nwhich, within corrections of order a2 , is equal to\n∞\n\u0011\n1 X 1 −bn\n1 \u0010\n1\n~Γ\ne = − ln 1 − e−b ∼\nln\n.\n2π n=1 n\n2π\n2π 2πT\n\n(D.16)\n\nAltogether, returning to our original notations through use of (D.5), we find from the first two terms of (D.13), for\nt \u001d ~/2πT :\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n!\nτrecur dB π\ng\n2πt\n1\n~Γ\n2πt\n= coth\n1 − cos\n+ ln\nsin\n.\nγ dt\n4\nT\nτrecur\n2 2πT\nτrecur\n\n184\n\n(D.17)\n\nLikewise, the function B(t) itself behaves in this region as\n!\n!\nγπ\ng\nt\n1\n2πt\nγ\n~Γ\n2πt\nγζ(3) g2\n,\nB(t) =\ncoth\n−\nsin\n+\nln\n1 − cos\n− 3\n4\nT τrecur 2π\nτrecur\n4π 2πT\nτrecur\nπ T2\n\n(D.18)\n\nwhere the last piece arises, in the considered approximation, from the last term of the sum in (D.15).\nD.4. Approximations for Θ(t) and D(t)\nWe have just seen that the dominant contribution to B(t) in the region t \u001d ~/2πT originates from the poles ω = ±Ω\nof the integrand of (D.8). Likewise, as we need only an estimate of Θ(t) and D(t), we will evaluate approximately\nthe integral in (D.7) by picking up only the contributions of these poles. As we did for B(t), we deform and close the\nintegration contour in the upper or in the lower half-plane, but we now disregard the singularities of K̃(ω ∓ 2J2 m/~).\nThis approximation amounts to make the replacements\nω sin ωt − Ω sin Ωt\nπ\n7→ cos(Ωt)[δ(ω − Ω) + δ(ω + Ω)],\n2\nω2 − Ω2\nπ\nΩ(cos Ωt − cos ωt)\n7→ sin(Ωt)[δ(ω − Ω) + δ(ω + Ω)],\n2\nω2 − Ω2\n\n(D.19)\n(D.20)\n\nwhich as we have seen are justified for t \u001d ~/2πT .

Three values mi occur here, namely −mB , m⇑ ' mF and\nm⇓ ' −mF , with mB \u001c mF , so that we find over the whole range 0 < μ < mF , through explicit integration of (7.30),\nt\nτreg\n\n= ln\n\nm2\nmB + μ\n+ a ln 2 F 2 ,\nmB\nmF − μ\n\n(E.2)\n\na=\n\nT (J − T )\n,\nJ[T − J(1 − m2F )]\n\n(E.3)\n\nwhere the coefficient a, given by\n\ndecreases with temperature from a = 1 at T = 0 to a = 12 for T = J. For short times, such that μ \u001c mF , we recover\nfrom the first term of (E.2) the evolution (7.43) of μ(t). When μ approaches mF , the second term dominates, but as\nlong as mF − m is of order mB the time needed for μ to reach m is of order τreg ln(mF /mB ). We define the cross-over by\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n186\n\nwriting that the two logarithms of (E.2) are equal, which yields μ = mF − 21 mB .

To this aim, we still truncate the Mittag-Leffler expansion (E.1) of 1/v(m). However, we now retain\nnot only the real poles but also the two complex poles near mc which govern the minimum of v(m).

We gather here some derivations.\nThe Green’s function G(m, m0 , t − t0 ) associated to the equation (7.1) for PM (m, t) will be obtained from the\nbackward equation\n∂\n∂\n1\n∂2\nG(m, m0 , t − t0 ) + v(m0 ) 0 G(m, m0 , t − t0 ) + [w(m0 ) 02 G(m, m0 , t − t0 )] = −δ(m − m0 )δ(t − t0 ),\n0\n∂t\n∂m\nN\n∂m\n\n(F.1)\n\nwhere t0 runs down from t + 0 to 0.

We are interested here only in the\nfirst two stages. During the first stage, the relevant values of m lie in the region where the approximation (7.59) holds.\nThe functions of m and t: μ0 , D and A, satisfy according to (F.2) the equations\nτreg\n\n∂μ0\n= −mB − μ0 ,\n∂t\n\n157 Whether bitten by the dog or the cat, the result is equal\n\n1\n∂D\nT\nτreg\n=\n− D,\n2\n∂t\nJ−T\n\nτreg\n\n∂A\n= −A,\n∂t\n\n(F.4)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n188\n\nand the boundary condition G(m, m0 , 0) = δ(m − m0 ) for t0 = t − 0 yields\nμ0 = −mB + (m + mB )e−t/τreg ,\n\nD=\n\nT\n(1 − e−t/τreg ),\nJ−T\n\nA = e−t/τreg .\n\n(F.5)\n\nAs function of m, the probability\nPM (m, t) =\n\nZ\n\ndm0G(m, m0 , t)PM (m0 , 0)\n\n(F.6)\n\ngiven by (F.3), (F.5) involves fluctuations which increase exponentially as exp(t/τreg ).\nIn the second stage, the time is sufficiently large so that PM (m, t) extends over regions of m where the linear\napproximation (7.59) for v(m) fails; we must account for the decrease of |v(m)|, which vanishes at m = ±mF . We\ntherefore cannot comply directly with the boundary condition for G(m, m0 , t − t0 ) at t0 = t since it requires m0 to be\nlarge as m. However, during this second stage PM (m, t) is not peaked, so that diffusion is negligible compared to drift.\nThe corresponding Green’s function, with its two times t and t0 taken during this stage, is given according to (7.32) by\n!\nZ m\ndm00\n1\n0\n0\n0\nδ t−t −\n.\n(F.7)\nG(m, m , t − t ) =\n00\nv(m)\nm0 v(m )\nWe can now match the final time of (F.3), (F.5) with the initial time of (F.7), using the convolution law for Green’s\nfunctions. This yields an approximation for G(m, m0 , t) valid up to the final equilibration stage. We therefore define\nthe function μ0 (m, t) by the equation\nZ m\ndm00\nt=\n,\n(F.8)\n00\nμ0 (m,t) v(m )\nof which (F.5) is the approximation for small m and μ0 . For m > −mB , we have m > μ0 > −mB and v (m00 ) > 0; for\nm < −mB we have m < μ0 < −mB and v (m00 ) < 0. We also note that the convolution replaces A = e−t/τreg by\nA(m, t) =\n\nv[μ0 (m, t)] ∂μ0 (m, t)\n=\n.\nv(m)\n∂m\n\nAltogether the Green’s function (F.3) reads\ns\n\"\n#\nv(μ0 )\nN(J − T )\nN(J − T )(m0 − μ0 )2\n0\nG(m, m , t) =\nexp\n−\n,\nv(m) 2πT (1 − e−2t/τreg )\n2T (1 − e−2t/τreg )\n\n(F.9)\n\n(F.10)\n\nwhere μ0 = μ0 (m, t) is found through (F.8). The resulting distribution function PM (m, t), obtained from (F.6), (F.10)\nand PM (m, 0) ∝ exp[−N(m − μ0 )2 /2δ20 ], is expressed by (F.10) or, in the main text, by (7.61) with (7.63) for δ1 (t).\nNotice that here we allowed for a finite value μ0 of the average magnetization in the initial state.\nWe have studied in § 7.3.2 the evolution of PM (m, t) for g = 0 and for an unbiased initial state. For mB =\ng/(J − T ) , 0 and a non-vanishing expectation value of μ0 of m in the initial state, the dynamics of PM (m, t) is\nexplicitly found from (F.10) by noting that mB \u001c mF ; the expression (E.1) for v(m) thus reduces to\n1\n2am\n1\n=\n+\n,\nτreg v(m) m + mB m2F − m2\n\n(F.11)\n\nwith τreg = ~/γ(J − T ) and a defined by (E.3).

For t \u001d τreg we reach Suzuki’s\nscaling regime characterized by the scaling parameter (F.14), in which δ1 (t) reduces to the constant δ1 and in which\nmB can be disregarded. The asymmetry of PM (m, t) then arises only from the constant ξ0 . Even in the presence of this\nassymetry, the time t = τflat still corresponds to a flat PM (m, t), in the sense that the curvature of PM (m, τflat ) at m = 0\nvanishes.\nG. Density operators for beginners\nBegin at the beginning\nand go on till you come to the end:\nthen stop\nLewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland\nIn elementary courses of quantum mechanics, a state is usually represented by a vector |ψi in Hilbert space (or a\nket, or a wave function). Such a definition is too restrictive. On the one hand, as was stressed by Landau [85, 374],\nif the considered system is not isolated and presents quantum correlations with another system, its properties cannot\nbe described by means of a state vector. On the other hand, as was stressed by von Neumann [4], an incomplete\npreparation does not allow us to assign a unique state vector to the system; various state vectors are possible, with some\nprobabilities, and the formalism of quantum statistical mechanics is needed. Both of these circumstances occur in a\nmeasurement process: The tested system is correlated to the apparatus, and the apparatus is macroscopic. The opinion,\ntoo often put forward, that the (mixed) post-measurement state cannot be derived from the Schrödinger equation,\noriginates from the will to work in the restricted context of pure states. This is why we should consider, to understand\nquantum measurement processes, the realistic case of a mixed initial state for the apparatus, and subsequently study\nthe time-dependent mixed state for the tested system and the apparatus.\nThe more general formulation of quantum mechanics that is needed requires the use of density operators, and is\npresented in section 10 in the context of the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics. We introduce here, for\nteaching purposes, an elementary introduction to § 10.1.4. In quantum (statistical) mechanics, a state is represented by\na density operator D̂ or, in a basis |ii of the Hilbert space, by a density matrix with elements hi|D̂| ji. The expectation\nvalue in this state of an observable Ô (itself represented on the basis |ii by the matrix hi|Ô| ji) is equal to\nhÔi = tr D̂Ô =\n\nX\nhi|D̂| jih j|Ô|ii.\nij\n\nThis concept encompasses as a special case that of state vector, as the expectation value of Ô in the state |ψi,\n\n(G.1)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\nhÔi = hψ|Ô|ψi =\n\nX\n\nhψ| jih j|Ô|iihi|ψi,\n\n190\n\n(G.2)\n\nij\n\nis implemented by associating with |ψi the density operator D̂ = |ψihψ| or the density matrix hi|D̂| ji = hi|ψihψ| ji,\nreferred to as a “pure state” in this context.\nDensity operators have several characteristic properties. (i) They are Hermitean, D̂ = D̂† , (i. e., h j|D̂|ii =\nhi|D̂| ji∗ ), implying that the expectation value (G1) of a Hermitean observable is real. (ii) They are normalized,\ntr D̂ = 1, meaning that the expectation value of the unit operator is 1. (iii) They are non-negative, hφ|D̂|φi ≥ 0 ∀ |φi,\nmeaning that the variance hÔ2 i − hÔi2 of any Hermitean observable Ô is non-negative. A density operator can be\ndiagonalized; its eigenvalues are real, non negative, and sum up to 1. For a pure state D̂ = |ψihψ|, all eigenvalues\nvanish but one, equal to 1.\nIn the Schrödinger picture, the evolution of the time-dependent density operator D̂(t) is governed by the Hamiltonian H of the system if it is isolated. The Liouville–von Neumann equation of motion,\n\ni~\n\ndD̂(t)\n= [Ĥ, D̂(t)],\ndt\n\n(G.3)\n\ngeneralizes the Schrödinger equation i~d|ψi/dt = Ĥ|ψi, or, in the position basis, i~dψ(x)/dt = Ĥψ(x), which governs\nthe motion of pure states. The evolution of D̂(t) is unitary; it conserves its eigenvalues.\nIn quantum statistical mechanics, the von Neumann entropy\nS (D̂) = −trD̂ ln D̂\n\n(G.4)\n\nis associated with D̂. It characterizes the amount of information about the system that is missing when it is described\nby D̂, the origin of values of S being chosen as S = 0 for pure states. If S (D̂) , 0, D̂ can be decomposed in an\ninfinite number of ways into a sum of projections onto pure states (§ 10.2.3).\nThe concept of density operator allows us to define the state of a subsystem, which is not feasible in the context of\nstate vectors or pure states. Consider a compound system S1 + S2 , described in the Hilbert space H1 ⊗ H2 by a density\noperator D̂. This state is represented, in the basis |i1 , i2 i of H1 ⊗ H2 , by the density matrix hi1 , i2 |D̂| j1 , j2 i. Suppose\nwe wish to describe the subsystem S1 alone, that is, to evaluate the expectation values of the observables O1 pertaining\nonly to the Hilbert space H1 and thus represented by matrices hi1 |O1 | j1 i in H1 , or hi1 |O1 | j1 iδi2 , j2 in H1 ⊗ H2 . These\nexpectation values are given by\nhÔ1 i = tr1 D̂1 Ô1 =\n\nX\n\nhi1 |D̂1 | j1 ih j1 |Ô1 |i1 i,\n\n(G.5)\n\ni1 , j1\n\nwhere the matrix hi1 |D̂1 | j1 i in the Hilbert space H1 is defined by\nhi1 |D̂1 | j1 i =\n\nX\nhi1 , i2 |D̂| j1 , i2 i.\n\n(G.6)\n\ni2\n\nThe partial trace D̂1 = tr2 D̂ on the space H2 is therefore, according to (G1), the density operator of the subsystem S1 .\nIf the subsystems S1 and S2 interact, the evolution of D̂1 should in principle be determined by solving (G3) for the the\ndensity operator D̂ of the compound system, then by taking the partial trace at the final time. The elimination of the\nbath (subsection 4.1) followed this procedure. The evolution of a subsystem is in general not unitary, because it is not\nan isolated system.\nThe formalism of density operators is more flexible than that of pure states: It affords the possibility not only\nof changing the basis in the Hilbert space, but also of performing linear transformations in the vector space of observables, which mix the left and right indices of observables hi|Ô| ji and of density matrices hi|D̂| ji. The resulting\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n191\n\nLiouville representations of quantum mechanics [75, 301, 302] are useful in many circumstances. They include for\ninstance the Wigner representation, suited to study the semi-classical limit, and the polarization representation for a\nspin, currently used by experimentalists, in which any operator is represented by its coordinates on the basis (3.1) of\ndis\nthe space of operators; in the present work, the parametrization of the state D̂ of S + M by Pdis\nM (m) and C a (m) enters\nthis framework (Eqs. (3.18), (3.27), (3.29), (3.30)).\nH. Evolution generated by random matrices from the factorized ensemble\nFor they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind\nHosea 8.7\nThe purpose of this Appendix is to work out Eq. (11.14) of the main text, where the average is taken over an\nensemble of random Hamiltonians with the eigenvector distribution factorized from the eigenvalue distribution. The\neigenvectors are then distributed with the uniform (Haar) measure, while we are free to choose the eigenvalue distribution (e.g. from some plausible physical arguments). The case where the random matrix elements are Gaussian and\ndistributed identically belongs to this class [257]. For simplicity we shall deal here with the microcanonical relaxation\nof one set of states. The extension to two sets (the case discussed in the main text) is straightforward.\nWe thus need to determine the average evolution [inside this Appendix we take ~ = 1]\nÛ⇑ ρ̂Û⇑† = e−itV̂⇑ ρ̂ eitV̂⇑ ,\n\n(H.1)\n\nwhere V̂⇑ is a random matrix generated according to the above ensemble, and where ρ̂ is an initial density matrix; see\nEq.

To calculate (H.1) we introduce\nÛ⇑ ρ̂Û⇑† =\n\nG\nX\n\nhψα |ρ̂|ψα i|ψα ihψα | +\n\nG\nX\n\nhψα |ρ̂|ψβ i |ψα ihψβ | eit(Eβ −Eα ) ,\n\n(H.2)\n\nα,β\n\nα=1\n\nwhere\nÛ⇑ (t) =\n\nG\nX\n\ne−itEα |ψα ihψα |\n\n(H.3)\n\nα=1\n\nis the eigenresolution of Û⇑ (t).\nWe now average (H.2) over the states |ψα i assuming that they are distributed uniformly (respecting the constraints\nof ortogonality and normalization). This averaging will be denoted by an overline,\n\nÛ⇑ ρ̂Û⇑† = Ghψ1 |ρ̂|ψ1 i |ψ1 ihψ1 | + hψ1 |ρ̂|ψ2 i |ψ1 ihψ2 |\n\nG\nX\n\neit(Eβ −Eα ) .\n\n(H.4)\n\nα,β\n\nIt suffices to calculate hψ1 |ρ̂|ψ1 i |ψ1 ihψ1 |, since hψ1 |ρ̂|ψ2 i |ψ1 ihψ2 | will be deduced from putting t = 0 in (H.4).

Expectedly, (H.5) is a linear\ncombination of ρ̂ and the unit matrix, because only this matrix is invariant with respect to all unitary operators.\nThe calculation of (H.6) brings\nc40 = 2c22 ,\n\nc22 =\n\n1\n.\nG(G + 1)\n\n(H.7)\n\nUsing (H.7, H.5) in (H.2) we obtain:\n1\n1\nÛ⇑ ρ̂Û⇑† =\n(G1̂ − ρ̂) +\n(G + 1)(G − 1)\n(G + 1)(G − 1)\n\n2\n!

Indeed,\nassuming that they are independently distributed with zero average and dispersion ∆ we get in the limit G \u001d 1:\nPG\n2 2\nα=1 exp(itE α ) ∝ exp(−t ∆ ). Obviously, the same relaxation scenario (under the stated assumptions) will hold for\nthe off-diagonal components; see Eq. (11.15) of the main text.\nThe reason of the non-exponential relaxation for the Gaussian ensemble is that all the non-diagonal elements of\nthe random matrix are taken to be identically distributed. This makes the distribution of the eigenvalues bounded (the\nsemi-circle law). If the elements closer to the diagonal are weighted stronger, the distribution of the eigenvalues will\nbe closer to the Gaussian. The above factorized ensemble models this situation.\nI. Collisional relaxation of subensembles and random matrices\nCollisions have a relaxing effect\nAnonymous\nThe purpose of this Appendix is to show that the evolution produced by a random Hamiltonian—which is normally\nregarded as a description of a closed, complex quantum system—may be generated within an open-system dynamics.\nThis enlarges the scope and applicability of the random matrix approach.\nI.1. General discussion\nThe ideas of collisional relaxation are well-known in the context of the classical Boltzmann equation. It is possible\nto extend the main ideas of the linearized Boltzmann equation (independent collisions with a system in equilibrium)\nto the quantum domain [375, 376, 377]. We shall first describe this scenario in general terms and then apply it to the\nspecific situation described in § 11.2.5.\nEach collision is an interaction between the target quantum system T and a particle of the bath B. The interaction\nlasts a finite but short amount of time. Then another collision comes, etc. The bath particles are assumed to be\nindependent of one another and thermalized. Each collision is generated by the Hamiltonian\nĤT+B = ĤT + ĤB + ĤI ,\n\n(I.1)\n\nwhere ĤT and ĤB are the Hamiltonians of T and B, respectively, and where ĤI is the interaction Hamiltonian. Each\ncollision is spontaneous and obeys the strict energy conservation:\n[ĤI , ĤB + ĤT ] = 0.\n\n(I.2)\n\nAllahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen / 00 (2018) 1–201\n\n193\n\nThis condition guarantees that there are no energy costs for switching the collisional interaction ĤI on and off.\nThe initial density matrix of B is assumed to be Gibbsian (this assumption can be relaxed)\nρ̂B =\n\n1\nexp[−βĤB ]\nZB\n\n(I.3)\n\nwith Hamiltonian ĤB and temperature 1/β = T > 0. The target system starts in an arbitrary initial state ρT and has\nHamiltonian ĤT . The initial state of T + B is ρ̂T+B = ρ̂T ⊗ ρ̂B . The interaction between them is realized via a unitary\noperator V̂, so that the final state after the first collision is\nρ̂0T+B = V̂ ρ̂T+B V̂† , ρ̂0T = trB ρ̂0T+B .\n\n(I.4)\n\nFor the second collision, the bath has lost memory of the first collision so that the new initial state of T + B is ρ̂0T ⊗ ρ̂B ,\nand so on.\nLet the energy levels of T involved in the interaction with B be degenerate: ĤT ∝ 1̂. Using (I.1–I.4) and going to\nthe eigenresolution of ρB we see that the evolution of T in this case can be described as a mixture of unitary processes\n(note that in Û k below, k is an index and not the power exponent)\nX\nρ̂0T =\nλk Û k ρ̂T Û k † ,\n(I.5)\nk\n\n\u0011\nÛ = exp −iδhk|ĤI |ki ,\nk\n\n\u0010\n\nÛ k Û k † = 1̂,\n\n(I.6)\n\nwhere {λk } and {|ki} are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively, of ρ̂B and δ is the interaction time. Eq. (I.5)\nholds for all subsequent collisions; now k in (I.5) is a composite index. Within this Appendix we put ~ = 1.\nNote that the mixture of unitary processes increases the von Neumann entropy S vN [ρ̂T ] = −tr[ρ̂T ln ρ̂T ] of T; this\nis the concavity feature of S vN . Hence after sufficiently many collsiions T will relax to the microcanonical density\nmatrix ρ̂T ∝ 1̂ that has the largest entropy possible.\nThe same process (I.5) can be generated assuming the Hamiltonian hk|ĤI |ki to be random, and then averaging over\nit. This is closely related to § 11.2.4 of the main text, where we postulated the random Hamiltonian VM = hk|ĤI |ki as\na consequence of complex interactions. For the purpose of § 11.2.4, T amounts to S + M (system + magnet) and the\ncomplex interactions are supposed to take place in M. In contrast, the averaging in (I.5) arises due to tracing the bath\nout. If the Û k mutually commute, (I.5) means averaging over varying phases, i.e. it basically represents a (partial)\ndephasing in the common eigenbasis of Û k .\nWe shall apply the collisional relaxation to the target system T = S + M after the measurement, so without the\nS-M coupling (g = 0). We can directly apply mixtures of unitary processes for describing the relaxation; see (I.5).\nFollowing to the discussion in § 11.2.4 of the main text [see the discussion before (11.12)], we assume that each\nunitary operator Û k in the mixture (I.5) will have the following block-diagonal form:\nÛ k = Π̂⇑ Û⇑k Π̂⇑ + Π̂⇓ Û⇓k Π̂⇓ ,\n\n(I.7)\n\nwhere in view of (11.10) of the main text we defined the following projectors\nX\nX\nΠ̂⇑ =\n|mF , ηihmF , η|,\nΠ̂⇓ =\n|−mF , ηih−mF , η|.\nη\n\n(I.8)\n\nη\n\nEq.

Gaussian random matrix ensemble: characteristic time scale within the collisional relaxation scenario\nAs we saw in the main text (§ 11.2.4), the relaxation generated by the Gaussian ensemble of random Hamiltonians\n(where the elements of the random matrix Hamiltonian are identically distributed Gaussian random variables) is\nnot exponential. From the viewpoint of the collisional relaxation, the averaging over a random matrix ensemble\ncorresponds to a single collision. We now show that taking into account many short collisions can produce exponential\nrelaxation.\nOur technical task is to work out Eq. (11.14) of the main text for multiple collisions. We introduce a shorthand\nρ̂(0) = |mF , ηihmF , η| and recall that within this Appendix ~ = 1. Following the assumptions we made in § 11.2.4\nof the main text [see Eq. (11.12)] we write Û⇑,⇓ = e−itV̂⇑,⇓ , where V̂⇑ and V̂⇓ are independent random matrices: the\nelements V⇑, ηη0 of V̂⇑ in the basis |mF , ηi (and of V̂⇓ in |−mF , ηi) are statistically independent, identically distributed\nrandom quantities with zero average and variance\nV⇑, η1 η2 V⇑, η3 η4 = V⇓, η1 η2 V⇓, η3 η4 =\n\n∆2\nδη η δη η .\n4G 1 4 2 3\n\n(I.10)\n\nNote that, for the Gaussian unitary ensemble characterized by the weight (11.12) for Hermitean matrices, the real and\nimaginary parts of the off-diagonal elements of V̂⇑ (V̂⇓ ) are statistically independent, and that (I.10) holds for both\ndiagonal and off-diagonal elements.\nWe shall now assume that the duration δ of each collision is small and work out the post-collision state Û⇑ ρ̂(t)U⇑† =\ne−iδV̂⇑ ρ̂(t)eiδV̂⇑ :\ne−iδV̂⇑ ρ̂(t)eiδV̂⇑ = ρ̂(t) − iδ[V̂⇑ , ρ̂] −\n\no\nδ2 n\nV̂⇑ ρ̂(t) + ρ̂(t)V̂⇑ − 2V̂⇑ ρ̂(t)V̂⇑ + O(δ3 ).\n2\n\n(I.11)\n\n∆2\ntr(ρ̂)1̂.\n4G\n\n(I.12)\n\nAveraging with help of (I.10) produces\nV̂⇑ ρ̂ = 0,\n\nV̂⇑2 ρ̂ = ρ̂V̂⇑2 =\n\n1 2\n∆ ρ̂,\n4\n\nV̂⇑ ρ̂V̂⇑ =\n\nThis brings\n#\n\"\n1 2 2\n1̂\n+ O[δ4 ∆4 ].\nρ̂(t + δ) = ρ̂(t) − δ ∆ ρ̂(t) −\n4\nG\n\n(I.13)\n\nIf the factor O[δ4 ∆4 ] in (I.13) is neglected, i.e. if\nδ2 ∆2 \u001c 1,\n\n(I.14)\n\n(I.13) can be extended to a recurrent relation for all subsequent collisions:\n\"\n#\n1\n1̂\nρ̂(nδ) = ρ̂((n − 1)δ) − δ2 ∆2 ρ̂((n − 1)δ) −\n,\n4\nG\nwhere n = 1, 2, . . . is the number of collisions.
