To further evaluate the methods’ effectiveness to detect genetic\nclusters in natural populations, we used previously published data on North American\npumas and a European shrub. Our results show that with simulated and empirical data, the\nBayesian spatial clustering algorithms outperformed direct edge detection methods. All\nmethods incorrectly detected boundaries in the presence of strong patterns of isolation by\ndistance. Based on this finding, we support the application of Bayesian spatial clustering\nalgorithms for boundary detection in empirical datasets, with necessary tests for the\ninfluence of isolation by distance.\nKeywords: landscape genetics; genetic boundaries; spatial Bayesian clustering; edge\ndetection methods\n\n1. Introduction\nIn spatial ecology, a boundary is a region of abrupt change in a map of biological variables.\nBoundaries are of interest because their locations reflect underlying biological, physiological or social\nprocesses [1], including barriers to dispersal. Identification of genetic boundaries has recently received\nconsiderable attention in the fields of population genetics and phylogeography, especially in systems\nwhere species are either continuously or patchily distributed and where discrete populations are not\neasily defined. The detection of genetic boundaries may help to determine the underlying generating\nfactors such as important historical events [2] or ongoing barriers to gene flow (e.g., [3–5]). Therefore,\ndetecting genetic boundaries can help resolve population structure and improve understanding of\npopulation connectivity for conservation purposes [6], as well as allowing resource managers to better\nidentify important habitats for preserving genetic variation within species (e.g., [7]).\nTwo general families of techniques are currently used to identify boundaries in population\ngenetics [8]: Bayesian clustering algorithms and edge detection techniques. Bayesian clustering\nalgorithms intrinsically strive to identify discrete sets of individuals based on the analysis of the\nmultilocus genotypes [9–11]. They simultaneously delineate clusters of individuals based on the\nanalysis of individual genotypes and assign individuals to the identified cluster where their posterior\nprobability is highest. Although not specifically designed to do so, these analyses can all be interpreted\nin a spatial context, and as a by-product, individual clustering memberships can be used to identify\npotential genetic discontinuities across landscapes (e.g., [1,2]). Individuals can then be mapped with\nsymbols reflecting cluster membership, and these symbols can be overlaid with maps of landscape\nfeatures. Bayesian clustering methods have recently been enhanced to incorporate geographical\nlocations of individuals in prior distributions [14–18]. In spatial models, the probability that two\nindividuals belong to the same cluster is influenced by the geographic distance between them whereas\ngeographic proximity is ignored in aspatial models.\nEdge detection techniques directly identify areas where changes in variables occur from the analysis\nof allele frequency data [19]. Edge detection approaches such as Monmonier’s algorithm [20] and\nwombling [21,22] have a rich history of use in geography and ecology (see [23], and algorithms for\napplying them to genetic data have also been developed [24–27]). Some authors have detected genetic\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12\n\n867\n\nboundaries between populations using Monmonier’s algorithm [24,28,29], while Segelbacher et al.\n[30] used wombling at the individual level to detect genetic boundaries in capercaillie (Tetrao\nurogallus) populations.\nEffective conservation and management strategies depend on our ability to correctly identify\nboundaries in genetic data. Although studies have compared the relative performance of Bayesian\nclustering methods ([31] for aspatial Bayesian clustering methods; [17,32] for spatial methods), none\nhave explicitly compared the performance of clustering methods and edge detection methods using\ngenetic data. Although Fortin and Drapeau [19] compared clustering and wombling-based methods\nusing plant community data, such data respond strongly to underlying environmental factors, whereas\npatterns in neutral alleles respond to varying patterns of demographic and evolutionary (mutation and\ngenetic drift) factors that are only indirectly under environmental influence. Thus, the results of this\nearlier comparison cannot be extended to neutral genetic data.\nThe main objective of this paper is to compare the performance of spatial Bayesian clustering\nmethods with that of edge detection methods for identifying genetic boundaries and to provide\nrecommendations for their use. Our comparison includes three published spatial Bayesian clustering\napproaches and two direct edge detection methods (Table 1). We first compared the methods using\ndata generated by a spatially-explicit simulation model with the objective to evaluate the influence of\nfour factors: (i) time after divergence, (ii) strength of isolation by distance, (iii) level of genetic\ndiversity, and (iv) amount of gene flow across barriers. To estimate the performance of the methods\nunder more typical, “real-world” conditions, we then applied them to two published empirical datasets.\nTable 1.

Materials and Methods\n2.1. Description of the Methods\nBayesian clustering approaches simultaneously aim to identify the number of clusters and to assign\nprobabilistically either individuals (versions without admixture models) or a fraction of their genome\n(with admixture models) to identified clusters such that Hardy-Weinberg and linkage disequilibria are\nminimized. Numerous models and software programs have been developed to achieve these objectives;\nalthough their goals are similar (i.e., describing the genetic structure in each subpopulation using a\njoint probability distribution over the observed loci), the explicit model assumptions, fine details, and\ncomputational strategies vary among approaches and may lead to performance differences. In\ncomparison, Monmonier’s algorithm and wombling can be classified as “direct methods” of edge or\nboundary detection, since they do not look for clusters of individuals but instead focus on boundaries\nbetween dissimilar samples. A more detailed technical introduction to these approaches can be found\nelsewhere [2,16,18,27]. In addition, recent reviews of Guillot et al. [8] and Francois and Durand [33]\ndiscussed major differences between all of them. For convenience, we will refer to each method by the\nname of the software that implements it.\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12\n\n869\nTable 2. Glossary of technical terms used.\n\nHidden Markov Random Field\n\nA hidden Markov random field model is a special case of Hidden Markov Models\n(HMM). A HMM is a statistical model in which the system being modeled is\nassumed to be a Markov process with unknown parameters, and the challenge is\nto determine the hidden parameters from the observable parameters.\n\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo\n\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo methods are a class of algorithms for sampling from\nprobability distributions based on constructing a Markov chain that has the\ndesired distribution as its equilibrium distribution.\n\nNeighborhood graphs\n\nNeighborhood graphs capture proximity between points by connecting nearby\npoints with a graph edge. Many possible ways to determine nearby points lead to\na variety of neighborhood graph types such as Voronoi tesselation and Delaunay\ntriangulation.\n\nVoronoi tesselation\n\nGiven a set of N points in a plane, Voronoi tessellation divides the domain in a set\nof polygonal regions, the boundaries of which are the perpendicular bisectors of\nthe lines joining the points.\n\nDelaunay triangulation\n\nThe Delaunay triangulation graph connects the adjacent geographical positions of\nthe samples on a map, resulting in a network that connects all the samples. None\nof the points is inside the circumcircle of any triangle.\n\nThe first Bayesian clustering algorithm we consider is BAPS5 [18], which implements both\nnon-spatial and spatial Bayesian clustering algorithms developed by Corander et al. [11,18,34,35]. The\nnon-spatial model in BAPS5 is similar to that used by the program STRUCTURE, as implemented by\nPritchard et al. [9], but in contrast to STRUCTURE, the non spatial model in BAPS5 directly estimates\nthe number of populations [18]. The program has undergone several model and algorithm\nimprovements, in particular a strategy based on a non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm\n(Table 2). As an extension, the spatial Bayesian clustering algorithm available in BAPS5 uses a\nDelaunay graph to specify hypothesized connections between individuals or sampling sites based on\ntheir locations. The model therefore involves three quantities: a graph specifying the set of neighbors\nof each individual, a parameter that prescribes the weight of spatial information in the inference\nscheme, and the number of clusters. The latter two parameters can be inferred within a formal\nstatistical method in BAPS5. The program aims to develop a computationally efficient model requiring\nminimal user expertise, hence the smaller effective number of parameters (Table 3).\nTESS [17,36] uses a hidden Markov Random Field model initially introduced by\nFrançois et al. [16] (Table 2). The model assumes that the log-probability that an individual belongs to\na particular cluster given the cluster membership of its closest neighbors is equal to the number of\nneighbors belonging to this cluster. The probability that two neighboring individuals belong to the\nsame spatial cluster is controlled by a parameter known as the interaction parameter. Any non-zero\nvalue introduces spatial dependence, with the default value set to 0.6. In practice, the TESS algorithm\ninvolves three quantities: a graph specifying the set of neighbors of each individual, the interaction\nparameter and the maximum number of clusters. Models with and without admixture are\navailable [36]. When the interaction parameter is set to 0 and the no admixture model is specified,\nTESS is equivalent to STRUCTURE without admixture and with uncorrelated allele frequencies. The\nmaximum number of clusters that best fit the data is chosen by the user from the statistical Deviance\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12\n\n870\n\nInformation Criterion (DIC), while in older versions (prior to version 1.2) this choice was made based\non likelihood values. TESS requires testing a range of different values of Kmax (the assumed\nmaximum number of clusters) and fixing 6 parameters to estimate the 3 parameters of interest\ndescribed above (Table 3). This method has been severely criticized by Guillot [37,38] and is the topic\nof ongoing debate.\nGENELAND [15,39–40] implements a method developed by Guillot et al. [14]; the program\nquantifies the amount of spatial dependence in a data set, estimates the number of populations, assigns\nindividuals to their population of origin, and detects individual migrants between populations, while\ntaking into account uncertainty on the location of sampled individuals. The spatial domain of the\nsample is partitioned into a union of a random number of polygons by Voronoi tessellation that is\nrandomly assigned to one of K possible spatial clusters. K is considered unknown, with maximal value\n(Kmax) input by users, and estimated by the algorithm. When polygons are assigned to different spatial\nclusters, the joint probability that any two polygons belong to the same spatial cluster decreases with\ngeographical distance between them [14]. Genetic data can be modeled using either correlated or\nuncorrelated allele frequencies [8]. Estimates of K (the number of spatial clusters) and individual\nassignment probabilities are obtained using a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, an iterative procedure\nwhich starts from arbitrary values for all unknown parameters and modifies them so that after many\niterations they approximate true values.\nMonmonier’s algorithm [20] is based on a neighbor graph (such as a Delaunay triangulation)\nbetween sampled populations or individuals, and calculates the genetic distances associated with each\nedge of the graph. The algorithm builds growing barriers from the edge with the largest genetic\ndistance, and extends it to the adjacent edges associated with the next largest genetic distance (see\n[20,42] for a more extensive description). This algorithm is implemented in the programs Barrier [24],\nthe R package Adegenet [43], and Alleles In Space (AIS, [25]), which we used in this analysis.\nWombling [21] uses surfaces derived from variables of interest (e.g., allele frequency surfaces), and\ncomputes gradients for each allele across these surfaces. The gradient norms are then averaged over\nalleles to form a new surface called the systemic function. Regions given high values by the systemic\nfunction can then be identified as zones of rapid change, i.e., boundaries. Various methods have been\nproposed to estimate the systemic map (e.g., [22]). A significance test (binomial test) on the systemic\nfunction has been introduced in the R package WOMBSOFT [27]. WOMBSOFT uses a\nnon-parametric smoothing method originally published by Cercueil et al. [26] to interpolate allele\nfrequencies across space. The output includes two maps, showing (1) absolute variations of the\nsystemic function (averaged over loci) in the study area, and (2) areas of sharp allele variation,\ni.e., boundaries estimated from the significance of the systemic function. The method requires\nfour parameters. The first is the resolution of the grid covering the study area. The second is a\nuser-defined bandwidth, which is typically based on the mean dispersal distance of the species, if\nknown. These two parameters are used to estimate the systemic function in each pixel. The third\nparameter is a percentile for the systemic function (p), and for each allele the method uses the\npercentile to select candidate boundary elements (i.e., points on the grid where the systemic function is\nhigher than p). The last parameter is the significance level, and for each point on the grid the method\ntests whether the number of candidate boundary elements follows a binomial distribution [B(n,p)],\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12\n\n871\n\nwhere n is the total number of alleles in the data set. It is then possible to identify boundary elements\nthat are significant at the chosen significance level.\nIn this study, we compared the performance of spatial Bayesian clustering algorithms with that of\nedge detection methods, including (i) the spatial model of BAPS5, (ii) the non-admixture model of\nTESS, (iii) the admixture model of TESS 2.1, (iv) GENELAND, (v) Alleles in Space, and\n(vi) WOMBSOFT (Table 1). Next, we describe the simulated and empirical datasets we used to\ncompare the methods.\nTable 3.

Simulation Data\nStandardized simulated data sets were generated using a time-forward Monte-Carlo procedure that\nencapsulated and generalized core processes and parameters of evolving spatially-structured\npopulations: (1) organisms inhabit a landscape, (2) each organism is born at a landscape location,\n(3) distances between birth and breeding sites are a function of dispersal ability, (4) progeny genomes\nare inherited from parents, and (5) alleles inherited from parents can mutate. Given our interest in\nsimulating barriers to gene flow and exploring emergent patterns associated with genetic\ndiscontinuities, our simulations were implemented in a two-step process: (1) simulation of an\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12\n\n872\n\nequilibrium global spatial evolutionary process without barriers, followed by (2) imposition of barriers\nto organismal movement.\n2.2.1. Simulation of Equilibrium Global Spatial Evolutionary Processes\nOur simulation procedure was similar to the lattice model implemented in Slatkin and\nBarton [44,45]. For a given simulated geographical landscape, we specified a 100 by 100 matrix of\n10,000 uniformly-ordered individuals. For simplicity, a single diploid, sexually-reproducing\nhermaphroditic individual capable of acting as either a sperm donor or egg donor inhabits each matrix\ncell. In each generation, new matrix cells [x,y] were filled by simulating reproduction between two\nparents occupying cells from the prior generation. The locations of parents were chosen by randomly\nselecting a pair of landscape coordinates using a bivariate normal distribution with parameter\ncentered on cell [x,y]. Consequently, the mean axial distance between individual birth and breeding\nsites ( ) is   =  √( /2) with a standard deviation of   =  √(2 −  /2) [46]. Note that larger values of\nwill permit drawing of parents from a larger spatial extent, and will consequently also reduce the\noverall degree of spatial genetic structure and isolation-by-distance within the system. In contrast,\nsmaller values of   will restrict the potential set of parents to those closer to cell [x,y], which in turn\nincreases the overall spatial genetic structure and isolation by distance within the simulated landscape.\nAfter the selection of parental individuals, a randomly-selected gamete from each parent was used to\nproduce a zygote that inhabits cell [x,y]. We further allowed for mutation of alleles in selected gametes\nby specifying a uniform pseudorandom number between zero and one. If the pseudorandom number\nwas less than the specified mutation rate ( ), then the allele was mutated to a new, previously\nunobserved allelic state. In our simulations, we initialized all individuals with identical homozygous\ngenotypes (i.e., H0 = 0, F0 = 1). However, over the course of many generations, quasi-equilibrium\nspatial patterns of genetic structure and diversity emerged that reflected specified population sizes and\nmutation rates. At quasi-equilibrium, spatial distributions of alleles stochastically change over\ngenerations, but emergent properties of the system such as number of alleles (Na) and heterozygosity\n(H) remain relatively constant. Basic population genetic theory provides a basis for determining\nexpected numbers of alleles and heterozygosity of a population at equilibrium based on population size and\nmutation rate [47]. In all of our simulation runs, data generated were inspected to ensure that the evolving\npopulations yielded patterns of diversity expected based on specified mutation rates (see below).\n2.2.2. Imposing Barriers to Gene Flow\nOnce simulations achieved quasi-equilibrium states, we imposed barriers to gene flow such that the\noriginal 100 by 100 landscape was divided into four separate 50 by 50 landscape subsections\n(see Figure 1). To test the effect of barrier strength, we first assumed that barriers prevented all\nmovement among different landscape subsections. In order to simulate a more realistic scenario, an\nadditional set of simulations was created in which the amount of movement between different\nlandscape subsections is defined by a parameter (b) that reflects the proportion of attempted barrier\ncrossings that are allowed in each generation. Note that when b = 0, no barrier crossings are permitted\nand gene flow among landscape subsections is nonexistent.\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12\n\n873\n\n2.2.3. Simulation Parameters\nWe examined five simulation parameter combinations that allowed us to evaluate the effects of\naverage dispersal distances ( ), mutation rates ( ) and amount of gene flow across barriers (b) on the\nability of the methods to correctly detect boundaries. Simulation parameters with impermeable barriers\n(b = 0) were as follows: (1)   = 1,   = 10−4; (2)   = 11,   = 10−4; (3)   = 1,   = 2.5 × 10−5; (4)   = 11,\n= 2.5 × 10−5. An additional set of simulations was run with 3% barrier permeability (b = 0.03),\n= 11, and   = 10−4. Twenty-five independent simulation replicates were generated for each parameter\ncombination, and 20 unlinked codominant loci were tracked over the course of each simulation\nreplicate. In the case of a population of 10,000 individuals and   = 10−4, population genetic theory\npredicts expected values of Na and H to be 34.59 and 0.8, respectively, at equilibrium [47]. In the\n= 2.5 × 10−5 case, Na and H are expected to be 10.48 and 0.5, respectively. In the initial phase\n(establishment of quasi-equilibrium patterns of spatial genetic structure), simulations were initially\nallowed to run for 20,000 and 80,000 generations for mutation rates of   = 10−4 and   = 2.5 × 10−5,\nrespectively. Simulations were run for more generations in the   = 2.5 × 10−5 case because, at low\nmutation rates, populations will take longer to reach an equilibrium state [47]. In the second phase,\ngenetic data were exported at generations 0 (before barriers were imposed), and at 100, 500, 1000,\n3000 and 5000 generations after the barriers were imposed to evaluate the temporal influence of the\nbarrier on genetic structure. Intuitively, as time progresses, the effects of barriers will become more\npronounced and result in greater differentiation of landscape regions. At each time point,\n200 randomly selected individuals were chosen from the landscape for each data set, and the same\nrandomly selected set of 200 coordinates was used for data sets exported at all six time points (with\ndifferent sets of coordinates randomly selected for each simulation replicate).\nAs descriptors of pre- and post-barrier simulation states, we used Arlequin 3.11 [48] to calculate\naverage FST values among landscape subregions at each of the six time points described above for each\nparameter combination. Note that due to the spatially explicit nature of our simulations, FST values\nshould not be interpreted literally due to the fact that individual landscape subsections are themselves\nspatially structured, and therefore do not comprise true panmictic populations. Likewise, for the\npurposes of describing the pre-barrier degree of spatial genetic structure for each parameter set, we\nfollowed the general recommendation of Rousset [49] and calculated the average slope of the\nleast-squares regression line derived from the regression of pairwise genetic distances on the log of\npairwise geographical distances between each of the 200 individuals sampled from each data set. We\nexpected to see higher regression slopes when the underlying pattern of spatial genetic structure is\nstronger (  = 1) relative to weaker (  = 11). Mean number of alleles, mean gene diversity and mean\nisolation by distance (IBD) slope observed in analyzed data sets of 200 individuals for each parameter\ncombination are reported in Table 4. These parameters were not reported for datasets with permeable\nbarriers, since the simulation parameters that influence genetic structure at generation 0 are the same as\nfor the simulations with   = 11,   = 10−4 and b = 0.\n\nInt.

Boundary Detection and Performance Evaluation of Each Method\nWe applied the five methods to the combination of 5 (parameter combinations) × 6 (generation\ntimes) × 25 (replicate simulations per parameter combination) = 750 datasets. The values of the\nparameters used for the statistical analysis are described in Table 3. Except for generation time 0,\nwhere there was no boundary (correct performance = no boundary detection), we expected to have two\nmain boundaries dividing the individuals into four separate spatial groups (Figure 1). The following\nmain steps were followed when evaluating the Bayesian clustering methods:\n(1). For each data set, we performed 10 independent runs for values of Kmax ranging from 1 to 6\n(Table 3). In the case of TESS, values of K corresponding to the highest average likelihood score\nacross runs were identified. Outputs from TESS analyses using the identified value of K were averaged\nover the 10 runs using the computer program CLUMPP [50]. BAPS5 provides its own internal\napproach for inferring the most likely number of clusters in a data set, presenting only the result with\nthe highest average likelihood score and the corresponding cluster membership coefficients of each\nindividual across the 10 runs.\n(2). For Bayesian clustering methods, we considered boundaries to be correctly inferred if the\nnumber of spatial clusters estimated was four and if individuals were all correctly assigned to the\nclusters from their respective landscape region, except for generation time 0. At generation 0, we\nexpected no detectable boundary and for all individuals to be assigned to the same cluster (K = 1).\n(3). For each parameter combination and at each time point, we calculated the percentage (out of the\n25 repetitions) of cases where the boundaries (or no boundary at generation 0) had been\ncorrectly detected.\nFor both edge detection methods, we visually checked outputs from each program to determine if\nboundaries were correctly detected (out of the 25 repetitions performed for each parameter set);\nFigure 1A and B show results considered to be correct.\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12\n\n875\n\n2.3. Empirical Data\nTo evaluate the performance of the methods for the empirical datasets, we reanalyzed two\npreviously published datasets and compared our results with those reported in the original papers.\n2.3.1. Puma (Puma Concolor)\nThe first dataset consisted of 540 pumas from the southwestern United States (Latitude: 31° to 42°,\nLongitude: −114° to −103°) genotyped for 16 microsatellite loci by McRae et al. [13]. The number of\ndetected alleles per locus was 3.95, and average expected heterozygosity was 0.62. We reanalyzed the\ndata using BAPS5, TESS, GENELAND, WOMBSOFT and AIS. In TESS, values for parameters of\nMCMC chain (number of sweeps and burn-in number of sweeps) and prior distribution (maximal\nnumber of clusters and interaction parameter) were chosen through a series of evaluation runs with\nvarying values. Values of the chain length and the burn-in period for which convergence was reached,\nthe value for maximal numbers of spatial clusters (from 1 to the number of populations presented in\nthe original paper increased by 2) and the interaction parameter (Table 3) that gave the highest\nlikelihoods were chosen and used for the 10 independent final runs performed with and without the\nadmixture option. For BAPS5, we evaluated the same range of Kmax values as for TESS (Table 3).\nTen runs of GENELAND model with uncorrelated allele frequencies were applied. Kmax values for\nthe runs were chosen based on the results of the original paper and compared to the estimated number\nof spatial clusters from each run in order to avoid limiting estimation by setting overly small values.\nFor WOMBLING, the grid resolution and the bandwidth size were chosen from the size and the shape\nof the sampling area. Monmonier’s algorithm was applied on both raw and residual genetic distances\nto remove the influence of isolation by distance [24]. Up to five boundaries were specified for\nthe analysis.\n2.3.2. Rhododendron (Rhododendron Ferrugineum)\nThe second dataset consisted of leaf samples of R. ferrugineum collected during summer of 2004\nacross the entire European Alps (latitude: 44°48’ to 48°36’; longitude: 5°20’ to 15°40’). A\n12’ latitude × 20’ longitude (ca. 23 km × 25 km) grid was adopted and three plants were sampled in\neach of 127 cells resulting in a total of 380 samples distributed over ca. 171,350 km2 (see [51] for\nmore details). One hundred and twenty AFLP markers were generated following the protocol of Vos\net al. [52]. These data were first analyzed with methods adapted for dominant markers (BAPS5,\nGENELAND, WOMBSOFT, AIS), considering AFLP markers as binary variables [53]. To allow the\napplication of TESS to these dominant data, we recoded them as suggested by Evanno et al. [54],\ncoding each individual with band absence as a recessive diploid homozygote (0-0 genotype, each\nnumber corresponding to an allele) and each individual with band presence as either dominant\nhomozygote or heterozygote (1–99 genotype, 99 indicating missing data). The resolution of the grid\nused in WOMBSOFT was the same as the sampling grid (i.e., 23 km × 25 km), with a slightly larger\nbandwidth of 30 km (Table 3). For all the other parameters (convergence parameters), we used the\nsame criteria as those used for the puma dataset.\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12\n\n876\n\n3. Results\n3.1. Simulated Data\nOver all simulation parameter combinations (including permeable and non-permeable barriers), the\nmean percentage of cases where the boundaries were correctly identified was highest for GENELAND\nand lowest for WOMBSOFT (Table 5). The Bayesian clustering methods without admixture\noutperformed edge detection methods in all cases. The success rate and order in which the methods\nranked in their ability to correctly detect boundaries is: GENELAND (69%), TESS (spatial, no\nadmixture; 57%), BAPS5 (38%), Monmonier’s algorithm (27%), TESS (spatial with admixture 25%),\nWOMBSOFT (21%) (see Table 5). For datasets simulated with non-permeable barriers only, the\nrankings change in favor of TESS with no admixture (67%).\nFigure 1. Results obtained with simulated datasets at generation 2,500. Genetic boundaries\nwere simulated using   = 0.000025 and   = 11 for panels A, B, C, and D, and   = 0.000025\nand   = 1 for panel e. (A) Monmonier's algorithm.

Cont.\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nAt generation 0, all spatial variation should occur across gradients and is due to isolation by\ndistance, and no sharp boundaries should be detected. Our simulations showed significant isolation by\ndistance patterns (larger slopes) with   = 1 relative to simulation where dispersal was more widespread\n(  = 11) (Table 4). However, both edge detection methods and TESS with admixture always detected\nboundaries (Table 5), despite the fact that no barriers were yet imposed upon the landscape. The other\nBayesian clustering methods (TESS without admixture, GENELAND and BAPS5) correctly identified\na single cluster (no boundaries at generation 0) only when the overall degree of spatial genetic\nstructure was low (i.e.,   = 11) (Table 5).\nAs expected, the time elapsed (number of generations) following imposition of barriers was highly\ncorrelated with FST (Figure 2A). Likewise, the overall success rate of each procedure tended to increase\nwith time following barrier imposition (Table 5). For non-permeable barriers, at generation 100,\nGENELAND correctly detected boundaries in 49% of datasets, while no boundaries were detected by\nany other procedure (Figure 2B). However, the percentage of correct boundary detections increased\nwith generation time across methods, becoming highest for TESS without admixture. Above\ngeneration 3000, TESS detected boundaries with at least 60 % success, and this increased to 100% at\ngeneration 5000 (Table 5, Figure 2B). All of the Bayesian clustering methods had a high success\n(average of 83.3%) for generations > 1000, while edge detection methods were successful in less than\n50% of cases for the same datasets. Differences in performance among the methods depended highly\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12\n\n878\n\non the parameter set under which the data were simulated (Table 5). At higher dispersal distances\n(  = 11; lower spatial genetic structure), boundaries were better detected by all methods for generation\n500 and later (Table 5). Decreasing the mutation rate decreased the mean percentage of boundary\ndetections except for   = 1 for BAPS5 and WOMBSOFT (Table 5).\nTable 5. Percent correct inferences observed in simulated data for each parameter\ncombination (25 replicates in each case) and for each generation time.

This increased its overall performance above TESS when the results for all\nparameter combinations and dispersal scenarios were compared. TESS with no admixture and BAPS5\ncorrectly detected only absence of boundaries for generation 0 in all 25 replicates (17%), while for all\nother settings they detected only up to three spatial clusters. Edge detecting methods failed to detect\ncorrect boundaries in all datasets with b = 0.03.\n3.2. Empirical Data\nAlthough TESS and BAPS5 identified boundaries between clusters that were largely consistent with\nthe original studies, results still varied between the two methods, with different numbers of clusters\nidentified for both species. Using the admixture option in TESS increased the number of identified\nclusters. Results of GENELAND were in both cases almost identical to the results of BAPS5. The\nWOMBSOFT results were difficult to interpret, identifying large heterogeneous areas whereas\nMonmonier’s algorithm never identified biologically interpretable boundaries, instead detecting\nindividuals that were more genetically differentiated from their neighbors than expected\n(possible migrants).\n3.2.1. Puma\nAll Bayesian approaches identified the strong boundary between northern and southern puma\npopulations reported by the original authors (Figure 3). In all the evaluation runs for models with and\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12\n\n881\n\nwithout admixture, TESS did not detect more than seven spatial clusters, so for the 10 final runs, seven\nwas chosen as maximum number of populations, and the interaction parameter was set to 1 according\nto the highest likelihood score for this value in the evaluation runs. In all the results of the 10 final\nruns, TESS with admixture detected four to five spatial clusters, with similar north-south separation.\nProcessing those results with CLUMPP gave a solution with five spatial clusters (Figure 3A). The two\nnorthern clusters found by TESS highly corresponded to the BAPS5 solution that found only three\nclusters (Figure 3B), with TESS detecting some additional differentiation in the south. GENELAND\ndetected two to three spatial clusters in all 10 runs, and the run with highest likelihood had three. The\nlocations and individual assignments (Figure 3C) of those spatial clusters closely resembled to BAPS5\nsolution, with the exception of some differently assigned individuals in the zone of contact between\nclusters. WOMBSOFT indicated a heterogeneous area in the south (Figure 3). Monmonier’s algorithm\nidentified locally differentiated individuals or small groups not interpretable as boundaries (results\nnot shown).\nFigure 3. Results for puma dataset.

Results of GENELAND matched very well with BAPS5, with two smaller western spatial\nclusters merged into one with GENELAND. As with the puma data, the WOMBSOFT results were\ndifficult to interpret, indicating a heterogeneous area in the south and boundaries on the edge of the\nstudied area (Figure 4C) [51]. Monmonier’s algorithm detected long barriers separating individuals\nthat were not biological neighbors, but were connected in the neighborhood graph by the algorithm\n(results not shown).\nFigure 4.

Discussion\nIn this paper, we compared five methods with different underlying models in their efficiency and\nreliability for detecting genetic boundaries in both ideal (simulated) and realistic cases. Our\nsimulations allowed us to compare the results from each method against barrier locations known with\nperfect certainty, and to evaluate effects of factors such as time since barrier creation, mutation rate,\ndispersal distance, and gene flow across the barrier on the ability of each method to correctly infer\nboundaries. Our empirical analyses allowed a more realistic test of each method’s performance,\nintroducing complexities commonly found in real-world studies, including complicated and unknown\npopulation histories, irregular and ad-hoc sampling schemes (pumas), and genetic markers that do not\nconform to some of the methods’ assumptions (AFLPs). We do not claim to be exhaustive, but to\npresent results from a set of cases carefully chosen to shed light on a rapidly expanding research area.\nThe most striking result of our simulations was that the spatial Bayesian clustering methods\noutperformed the direct edge detection methods. While TESS matched or outperformed the other\nspatial models for datasets with small dispersal distances (δ = 1), GENELAND performed best for\ndatasets with δ = 11 and permeable barriers, identifying boundaries with almost 100% accuracy.\nBAPS5 performed well except under parameter combinations with δ = 1, where it rarely inferred the\ncorrect structure. For the same parameter combination, BAPS5 and GENELAND consistently tended\nto detect more than four simulated spatial clusters, finding additional subdivisions within clusters.\nAlthough visual inspection of these results indicated that in most cases the location of the simulated\nbarrier was correctly detected, they could not be counted as correct using our criteria. Small dispersal\ndistances and a high mutation rate in this scenario likely combined to result in spatial aggregation of\nsimilar alleles, giving the illusion of movement barriers when none actually existed [41]. This\ninference is in agreement with recently published results of Frantz et al. [32], who showed that both\nGENELAND and BAPS5 can overestimate genetic structure in datasets characterized by isolation by\ndistance. They did not include TESS in their study, so their results cannot be extended to it without\nfurther evaluation under different isolation by distance scenarios.\nUnder our simulation parameters TESS with admixture generally performed poorly, an unsurprising\nresult given that the imposition of impermeable barriers meant that there was no ongoing migration\nbetween subpopulations, and thus admixture was not to be expected. This poor performance can also\nbe explained by the fact that using the admixture option in TESS increases the number of parameters to\nestimate, reducing the reliability of parameter estimations in the absence of admixture. This has been\nrecently tested by Francois and Durand [33] in a review paper related to spatial Bayesian\nclustering method.\nThe success of GENELAND and failure of other methods for simulated datasets with permeable\nbarriers used in this study suggests that GENELAND is better suited for migration scenarios that may\nbe common in empirical datasets. Movement across barriers, in combination with large dispersal\ndistances, allows for strong gene flow across entire landscapes, and as a consequence weak spatial\nstructure that is difficult to detect. Poor results by TESS for permeable barriers can further be\nexplained by its lack of a correlated allele frequencies model; this model better matched our\nsimulations because of the instantaneous population fission scenario we used.\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12\n\n884\n\nAnother general result from our simulations was the presence of time lags between barrier\nimposition and their reliable detection by all methods (Table 5, Figure 2B). In our case the time lag is\nsubstantial. The results of a recent study on simulated datasets [55] suggested that barriers can in some\ncases be detected after as few as 15 generations. However, those results are not fully comparable with\nours due to different simulation scenarios, a different approach to the testing the barrier effect, and\ndifferent objectives. In our case, we started by simulating an underlying isolation by distance pattern,\nand then imposed barriers onto the landscape, whereas Landguth et al. [55] generated a random\ndistribution of genotypes across the landscape, then simultaneously imposed both barriers and\nrestricted dispersal. That means that the isolation by distance process was not independent of the\nbarrier effect, and that it therefore could have also contributed to the statistical signal that they\ndetected. Furthermore, their barrier detection approach was based on use of partial Mantel tests, which\nrequired specification of the location of an a priori hypothesized barrier. In our study we only included\nmethods that can detect barriers without an a priori notion of where they occur. In natural populations,\nthe length of time lags can also be related to sampling scheme, effective population size and\nsubstructure [33,56,57].\nOur empirical analyses also give more support to the clustering methods than to the direct edge\ndetection methods. Monmonier’s algorithm, using both raw and residual genetic distances for both\ndatasets, only detected boundaries around particular individuals that were genetically highly distinct\nfrom others in their immediate vicinity. Wombsoft detected, for both empirical datasets, wide\nheterogeneous areas difficult to interpret as boundaries. Although the exact numbers of spatial clusters\ndetected by the Bayesian spatial clustering methods differed for empirical datasets, all of them gave\nsolutions that were consistent with those reported in the original papers. For both datasets, results from\nGENELAND and BAPS5 matched very closely. For the puma dataset, both methods detected three\nspatial clusters and the same boundaries between northern and southern clusters as reported by McRae\net al. [13]. Although TESS detected more clusters, the location of the strong north-south boundary is\nunchanged. For the rhododendron dataset, the methods detected two strong genetic discontinuities\nisolating three putative populations [51]. Two of these populations—one in the eastern Alps and one in\nthe central Alps—were very homogeneous. The third, located in the southwestern Alps, was less\nhomogeneous [51], perhaps explaining the additional boundary identified by BAPS5 and TESS. The\nadditional boundary identified by TESS in the north was detected by no other methods and thus\ndifficult to trust. Additional local analyses would be required to confirm the observed structure.\nWOMBSOFT performed particularly poorly with our simulated datasets, and both edge detection\nalgorithms performed poorly with the empirical datasets. While wombling proved its potential in\necology [57] and in spatial genetics [58] as did Monmonier’s algorithm with population-based genetic\ndatasets [24,28,29], we cannot recommend their use with individual-based genetic data given our\nresults. The decreased performance of the edge detection methods with individual-based genetic data is\nlikely due in part to differences in the sources of variation between the data types. Sampling in ecology\nis affected by individual- and population-level variation, whereas genetic data contain additional\nvariation caused by sampling of loci within individuals. This within-individual variation is often very\nhigh in relation to other levels, introducing additional noise into individual-based analyses. The\nvariance in individual genotypes can particularly explain the poor performance of Monmonier’s\n\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12\n\n885\n\nalgorithm, which is in essence a local edge detector which is especially sensitive to local maxima when\nidentifying boundaries [28].\nNeutral genetic markers do not respond directly to underlying environmental factors. Boundaries\ndetected in data based on species occurrence likely reflect real factors to which the species are\nresponding. For example, an individual sample of plant community data surrounded by an inferred\nboundary likely indicates a localized area where environmental conditions (e.g., soil type) have\nresulted in a distinct community of species [19]. Conversely, a similar boundary detected in individual\ngenetic data may only denote an individual that is distinct from its neighbors, either due to random\nsampling variance in its genotype or a long distance dispersal event. Because wombling operates on\nsurfaces which locally integrate genetic data across many individuals, this technique may be less\nsensitive to individual variation than Monmonier’s algorithm. Nonetheless, wombling has performance\nlimitations as our results show.\n5. Conclusions and Recommendations\nBased on the percentage of correct inference for simulated data (Table 5), and comparison with\npreviously published results for empirical datasets, we recommend the use of Bayesian clustering\nmethods over local edge detection methods for individual-based genetic analyses. All algorithms are\nespecially powerful in detecting spatial genetic structure, although spatial autocorrelation and isolation\nby distance may inflate the true number of clusters when dispersal distances are limited. Based on the\nanalyses of our simulated datasets that include gene flow across barriers, GENELAND seems the most\nappropriate overall approach. Our results lend further support to the idea that a combination of\ndifferent analysis techniques can provide complimentary information and elucidate important patterns\nin individual-based population genetic data. While the performance of the local edge detection\nmethods was poor (particularly for the empirical datasets), there is still a need for the development of\nanalytical approaches that can provide additional information about the location and shape of genetic\nboundaries [59]. Such approaches, not based on specific genetic assumptions, will be especially useful\nfor mating systems that deviate from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium or for polyploid organisms.\nIn natural populations, substructuring of individuals can be caused by influences of isolation by\ndistance, gradients of landscape resistance, and true barriers [4]. The methods we compared were not\nable to separate these effects, so we advise additional tests to avoid misinterpretation of results. When\ninvestigating genetic boundaries in a dataset, we recommend first determining if isolation by distance\npatterns exists. If isolation by distance is not present, then any of the evaluated spatial clustering\nmethods can be used. If isolation by distance is significant, our results from simulated data suggest that\nTESS (with CLUMPP) will be more powerful, but this must be balanced against the potential\nadvantages of GENELAND discussed above. Lastly, when working with TESS, our analyses suggest\nthat the use of the admixture model reduces the program’s ability to detect barriers when there is no\nadmixture. We therefore advise researchers to carefully consider their hypotheses regarding ongoing\nmigration between subpopulations before deciding whether to include admixture in their\nanalysis model.\n\nInt.
