Clinically, bone grafts are used to treat congenital\nabnormalities, trauma, and cancer surgeries, each which carry a specific set of requirements.\nSuccessfully engineered grafts must exhibit biological and structural functions similar to native\ntissue and have ability to integrate into the surrounding tissue. Stem cells have the capability to\ndifferentiate and deposit mineral in culture on a three dimensional scaffold. In this thesis, the\nvisualization and quantitation of stem cell mediated remineralization of a demineralized collagen\nscaffold was demonstrated. The overall investigational approach was to first test feasibility of\nmineralization on demineralized and decellularized scaffolds in vitro using static culture (aim 1)\nand then use a perfusion bioreactor to create a physiologically relevant environment and further\nquantify and visualize the mineralization (aim 2). This novel, imaging-compatible bioreactor\nsystem yielded native bone architecture and enhanced bone volume when compared to static\nculture. Biomineralization was accomplished by remineralizing a collagen scaffold derived from\nbovine tissue in a trabecular anatomical pattern which was then quantified and visualized. Since\nstem cells are the biological powerhouse of this model, it is crucial to understand their specific\nrole and behavior. Biomineralization is driven by osteogenic differentiation and protein\nexpression of the stem cells. As fabricated mineralized collagen becomes better understood,\nlaboratory tissue engineering work will translate into improved clinical applications.\n\niv\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nList of Figures ................................................................................................................................ v\nList of Tables ................................................................................................................................. x\nAcknowledgements ....................................................................................................................... xi\nChapter 1 Introduction ................................................................................................................. 1\nBone ....................................................................................................................................... 1\nHierarchal structure ............................................................................................................... 1\nBone cells............................................................................................................................... 9\nMesenchymal stem cells ....................................................................................................... 10\nThe mineral phase ................................................................................................................. 11\nMineralization signaling molecules ..................................................................................... 12\nCell mediated mineralization................................................................................................ 15\nTissue engineering model ..................................................................................................... 20\nHypothesis and specific aims ............................................................................................... 23\nChapter 2 Materials and Methods ................................................................................................ 25\nStem cell isolation and cultivation ....................................................................................... 25\nScaffold fabrication and preparation.................................................................................... 25\nScaffold seeding and bioreactor culture .............................................................................. 27\nFlow cytometry ..................................................................................................................... 30\nBiochemical assays ............................................................................................................... 30\nStaining and histology/immunohistochemistry................................................................... 33\nMicro computerized tomography ......................................................................................... 34\nStatistical analysis ................................................................................................................. 34\nChapter 3 Results........................................................................................................................... 35\nOsteogenic differentiation potential of aMSCs ................................................................... 35\nStatic culture and decellularized scaffold ............................................................................ 36\nBioreactor culture and demineralized scaffold comparison ............................................... 40\nChapter 4 Discussion..................................................................................................................... 54\nDecellularized bone constructs in tissue engineering ......................................................... 54\nRemineralization of demineralized collagen scaffold ........................................................ 58\nBioreactor cultured aMSC gene expression ........................................................................ 63\nConclusion ............................................................................................................................. 65\nReferences ...................................................................................................................................... 67\nAppendix GO Analysis Data ................................................................................................ 77\n\nv\n\nLIST OF FIGURES\nFigure 1-1.

The Schematic of the array of collagen molecules within a mineralized\ncollagen fibril within a mineralized collagen fibril showing 2D and 3D organization\nand intrafibular mineral, following the Hodge and Petruska and Landis et al.\nmodels. a A single collagen molecule, 1.23 nm in diameter, 300 nm in length and\nspaced 0.24 nm apart, is shown as well as a 2D aggregate of collagen molecules,\ncross-linked into a quarter-staggered array with characteristic gap (40 nm) and\noverlap (27 nm) zones. The three columns of collagen molecules are shown in\nyellow (a, b). (b) Packing of consecutive 2D arrays into 3D assemblages occurs with\nstrict registration of all gap and overlap zones so that channels are created\nthroughout the model. The rectangular prisms (heavy black lines) running away\nfrom the viewer indicate these channels. c The cAp crystals, shown in blue, nucleate\nprincipally in the collagen gaps and grow preferentially in their c- crystal axis\ndirection.

Mechanism of cell-mediated bone mineralization. In osteoblast/osteocytes\nmatrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) negatively regulates the\nphosphate concentration via FGF23 and phosphate-regulating gene with\nhomologies to endopeptidases on X-chromosome (PHEX). Increasing inorganic\nphosphate stimulates the expression of a number of proteins, such as bone\nsialoprotein and SPARC (secreted protein, acidic, rich in cysteine). These proteins\ninitiate mineralization around type I collagen fibers by binding of calcium and\ninorganic phosphate. Propagation of mineralization is negatively regulated by\nphosphorylated osteopontin and dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), which may be\nreversed by TNAP, or cleavage by PHEX. Several membrane enclosed structures\nhave been related to mineralization. (a) Formation of intracellular vacuoles\ncontaining mineral needles (or empty ghosts), which are excreted into the\nextracellular matrix (ECM). Bone acidic glycoprotein-75 (BAG-75) sequesters high\nquantities of inorganic phosphate and recruits bone sialoprotein to these structures,\nenabling further mineralization. (b) Multilamellar vesicles are found in vascular\nsmooth muscle cell (VSMC)-mineralization, and (c) matrix vesicles are present in all\nforms of mineralization. (d) Exosomes are excreted during osteoblast- mediated\nmineralization. (e) These structures may associate with collagen fibers and facilitate\nmineralization, resulting in mineralized collagen fibers cover with lipid vesicles. 62 ...... 16\nFigure 1-6. Mineralization of a collagen fibril. a, Calcium phosphate clusters (green)\nform complexes with the polymer (orange line), forming stable mineral droplets. b,\nMineral droplets bind to a distinct region on the collagen fibres and enter the fibril.\nc, Once inside the collagen, the mineral in a liquid state diffuses through the interior\nof the fibril and solidifies into a disordered (amorphous) phase (black). d, Finally,\ndirected by the collagen, the amorphous mineral transforms into oriented apatite\ncrystals (yellow).74................................................................................................................. 18\nFigure 1-7. Schematic illustration of the proposed mechanism of collagen mineralization\nvia the PILP process. As a scaffold, type I collagen triple-helical “molecules” selfassemble into fibrils that exhibit a periodic banding pattern due to hole and overlap\nzones. The rods shown here represent the tropocollagen triple helices. (a)\nNanoscopic PILP droplets adsorb to the collagen fibril and are drawn into the gap\nzones of the fibril by capillary forces. (b) The amorphous phase solidifies once it has\nfully infiltrated the interstices of the fibril, including the gap zones as well as the\nregions between the collagen molecules. (c) Crystallization of the ACP phase into\nhydroxyapatite leaves the fibrils embedded with nanocrystals of hydroxyapatite that\nare aligned roughly parallel to the fibril.5 .......................................................................... 19\nFigure 1-8. Fabrication of engineered bone grafts. (A) Personalized bone tissue\nengineering process. Autologous MSCs (from fat aspirates) and CT images were\nobtained for each animal subject. The anatomical scaffold was fabricated from the\nbovine stifle bone that had been processed to remove any cellular material while\npreserving the tissue matrix. The cells were seeded into the scaffold and cultured in\nthe specially designed perfusion bioreactor. After 3 weeks, the engineered RCU was\nimplanted back into the pig for 6 months. (B) The bioreactor culture chamber\nconsisted of five components designed to provide tightly controlled perfusion\nthrough the anatomical scaffold: anatomical inner chamber with bone scaffold, two\nhalves of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (elastomer) block with incorporated\n\nvii\nchannels, two manifolds, and an outer casing. The PDMS block was designed as an\nimpression of the anatomical RCU structure and contained flow channels at both\nsides for the flow of culture medium in and out of the scaffold. The flow rate\nnecessary for providing nutrient supply and hydrodynamic shear was defined by the\ndesign of parallel channels in the elastomer block (with the channel diameters and\ndistribution dictated by the geometry of the graft) and the fluid-routing manifold.\nThe channel diameters and spacing were specifically designed by flow simulation\nsoftware for each pig to provide a desired interstitial flow velocity for a given shape\nand size of the anatomical RCU. (C) Flow simulation of the medium flow through\nthe anatomically shaped scaffold reveals uniform flow velocity throughout the\nvolume of the graft.90............................................................................................................. 22\nFigure 2-1.

Bone is a hierarchal structure with integration to\nmany of the biological systems. 1 Bone is always remodeling through constant and cellular\nmediated deposition and resorption. Bone defects caused by congenital abnormalities, trauma, or\ncancer surgeries can lead to major functional, sociological, and psychological problems. Recent\ntissue engineering advances have offered an alternative to the “gold standard” of bone autografts\nwhich still bring various complications such as donor site morbitidy. 2 The greater our knowledge\nof biomineralization, the more potential we have to create the most successful tissue engineered\nbone grafts.\n\nHierarchal structure\nBone is a hierarchal composite tissue with a complex ordered structure ranging from\nrepeating molecular nanostructures, leading all the way to whole bones. 3 Bone is classified as\neither primary or secondary. Primary bone is immature bone as it’s forming while secondary bone\nis mature. Normally when discussing bone structure and function, secondary bone is the focus. 4\nWeiner and Wagner wrote a review studying the material bone where they break bone into seven\nlevels:\n\n2\n\nFigure 1-1. The 7 hierarchical levels of organization of the bone family of materials. Level 1:\nIsolated crystals from human bone (left side) and part of an unmineralized and unstained collagen\nfibril from turkey tendon observed in vitreous ice in the TEM(right side). Level 2: TEM micrograph\nof a mineralized collagen fibril from turkey tendon. Level 3: TEM micrograph of a thin section of\nmineralized turkey tendon. Level 4: Four fibril array patterns of organization found in the bone\nfamily of materials. Level 5: SEM micrograph of a single osteon from human bone. Level 6: Light\nmicrograph of a fractured section through a fossilized (about 5500 years old) human femur. Level\n7: Whole bovine bone (scale: 10 cm).1\n\n3\nThe levels reviewed focus primarily on the mechanical components and less about the\nbiological impact of the cell mediated bio mineralization which is the focus of the experiments\ncompleted in this thesis. However it is imperative to have an understanding of the entire bone\nstructure.\nLevel 1: Major Components.\nThe major components of bone include carbonated apatite crystals, type I collagen and\nnon-collagenous proteins (NCP), and water. Overall composition of bone is roughly 65:25:10wt%\n(45/45/10vol%) mineral:organic:water. 5 The crystal formation mechanism will be discussed in\ndetail later.\nCarbonated apatite crystals are the mineral phase of bone and is structurally similar to\nhydroxyapatite (hAp).6 These crystals are plate-shaped of about 50x25nm and surprisingly flat\nwith thickness 3-4nm in mature bone.3,5\nType I collagen is fibrous in bone with a cylindrical triple helical structure with diameter\nof about 1.5nm and lengths 300nm.3 This is shown below in figure 1-2a.6 Collagen is comprised\nof three polypeptide chains each 1000 amino acids long including –(Gly-X-Y-)n–, where X and Y\nare frequently proline and hydroxyproline, which allow the formation of the triple helix.4\nThere are also various NCPs which are believed to be directly involved in the\nmineralization process including inhibition and promotion mechanisms. This could lead to\ncontrolled deposition, orientation and phase of minerals. 7 Many NCPs are phosophoproteins and\ninclude small integrating binding ligand with N-glycosylation (SIBLING) proteins which bind\ndirectly to collagen and provide interaction with extra-fibular ions.6 Osteopontin (OPN) and bone\nsialoprotein (BSP) are examples of these SIBLING NCPs. This will be further discussed under\nmineralization mechanism. NCPs comprise about 3% of the organic composition in bone while\ncollagen is the major organic component. 5\n\n4\nWater is sometimes overlooked yet it’s essential in bone. Water stabilizes the collage n\nstructure, which will be discussed in further levels, by bridging adjacent molecules through\nhydrogen bonding.8 This water contributes especially to the mechanical performance of bone.\nWANG\nLevel 2: Mineralized Collagen Fibril. The tertiary collagen structure has periodicity of\n67nm with a 40nm gap between ends of two vertically aligned collagen molecules with a 27nm\noverlap region (Fig. 1-2b).6 This structure is quarter staggered which is stabilized by the water\nbetween the fibrils.\nThe cAp mineral forms after cells have secreted the extracellular matrix (ECM) collagen\n1 matrix. Mineral forms within the gap regions between collagen fibrils (Fig. 1-2c,d), as well as\non the fibril surface. The cAp nucleates in the gap region and grow preferentially through the ccrystal axis direction vertically along the fibril. Eventually the cystal plates will occupy the\nentirety of the 40nm gap region and begin to occupy the narrow pore space between fibrils\n(0.24nm).6 It is unclear whether there is more intra or extrafibrillar cAp but both are present in\nmature bone.9 There is a study which shows that somewhere between 70-80% of the cAp is\nintrafibrillar.10 Other literature suggests that a majority of cAp is located extrafibrillar. 12\nEach fibril of collagen has approximate diameter of 80-100nm3. Biologically, fibrils are\nrarely alone and in bone mineralized fibrils are aligned vertically. This will be further discussed\nin the next level.\n\n5\n\nFigure 1-2. The Schematic of the array of collagen molecules within a mineralized collagen fibril\nwithin a mineralized collagen fibril showing 2D and 3D organization and intrafibular mineral,\nfollowing the Hodge and Petruska and Landis et al. models. a A single collagen molecule, 1.23 nm\nin diameter, 300 nm in length and spaced 0.24 nm apart, is shown as well as a 2D aggregate of\ncollagen molecules, cross-linked into a quarter-staggered array with characteristic gap (40 nm)\nand overlap (27 nm) zones. The three columns of collagen molecules are shown in yellow (a, b).\n(b) Packing of consecutive 2D arrays into 3D assemblages occurs with strict registration of all gap\nand overlap zones so that channels are created throughout the model. The rectangular prisms\n(heavy black lines) running away from the viewer indicate these channels. c The cAp crystals,\nshown in blue, nucleate principally in the collagen gaps and grow preferentially in their c- crystal\naxis direction. The (100) planes describing the largest developing face of the crystals generally lie\nparallel to each other and to the collagen molecules associated with the crystals. d Growth of the\ncAp phase to occupy the entire 40-nm length of the gap. The channels are thought to allow lateral\ngrowth of the cAp nuclei into nanoplatelets. As pictured, the cAp has extended beyond the gap zone,\nbut the narrow pore spaces (0.24 nm) between adjacent collagen molecules have unknown capacity\nto accommodate mineral.6\n\nLevel 3: Fibril Array. These mineralized collagen fibrils are aligned vertically in nondiscrete bundles.1 We know little about the internal organization of each fibril including the\northotropic structure. Are the fibrils aligned in all three dimensions forming a crystalline\n\n6\nstructure? On the opposite end of the spectrum, are they aligned only at the fibril axis? This is\nimportant in order to understanding the packing tendencies and relative order and the\ncorresponding mechanical properties in higher levels.\nLevel 4: Fibril Array Patterns. The fourth level is diversity in fibril array organizational\npatters. From Weiner et al. there are four common fibril patterns.\nPattern 1 is the array of parallel fibers. This can most easily be described as an expansion\nof level 3 bone. This array is on the order of microns or millimeters, and is most commonly found\nin mineralized tendons and parallel fibered bone. It is most commonly found in the bovid family\n(hoofed mammals), and it is the precursor to lamellar bone.\nPattern 2 is the woven fiber structure. The fibrils are arranged in highly unorganized\nbundles which is nearly the opposite of the parallel fibers. While found in amphibian and reptile\nskeletons, it’s also found in mammalian embryos though it is later replaced by other bone types.\nBeing that it can be formed relatively quickly, it is also formed immediately after bone fractures.\nPattern 3 is plywood-like structures. This a complex fibril structure where the orientation\nof each fiber layer is different. Layers can vary in thickness and angles contributing to the\ncomplexity of this structure. Extremely common in humans, these layers are folded in cylinders\ncalled osteons which will be covered in level 5.\nPattern 4 is radical fibril arrays. The fibrils form a plane pattern parallel to the surface.\nThis is found in dentin, the inner layer of teeth. While this fibril array is not especially relevant to\nbone there are many similarities, in terms of mineralization.\nLevel 5: Cylindrical Motifs. The fifth level is cylindrical motifs of osteons (also known\nas Haversian canals). This cylindrical structure is characteristic of bone because it is one of the\nfew types of biominerals that undergo remodeling. During bone remodeling large cylinders are\nhollowed out by bone cells, known as osteoclasts, which break down bone. Next osteoblasts fill\nthis tunnel with concentric layers of lamellar bone. Once the cylinder is nearly filled a blood\n\n7\nvessel is left in the center running parallel to the long axis of the cylinder. These osteons\ncontribute to the higher order structure of bone.\nLevel 6: Spongy vs Compact Bone. Bone is comprised of two types of bone, cortical and\ntrabecular (or cancellous). Cortical bone is the dense outer bone while trabecular bone is the\nspongy bone on the inside. Inside the trabecular bone is the bone marrow. 1 Large volumes of\ntrabecular bone are found in the metaphysis (at the heads, near the end where growth plate\nresides) in long bone. While cortical and trabecular bone remodel, trabecular bone has much\nhigher metabolic activity.\nTrabecular bone is comprised of bone “struts” forming interconnected pores with marrow\nfilled cavities. Due to this interweaved structure the mechanical properties are much weaker than\ncortical bone. However, there is a great deal of variation among the entirety of the trabecular bone\ndue to variety of sample densities.13 With a much higher turnover rate trabecular bone is on\naverage “younger”.\nWhile cortical bone is much denser, there is still variation due to differences in porosity,\nmineralization level, and specific organization.\nLevel 7: Whole Bone. Whole bone is what supports the mechanical function of the\nhuman body. There are several variations of bone shapes and structures which will not be covered\nin this paper, but mechanisms of bone formation will be covered. There are two main methods:\nendochondral ossification (EO) and intramembranous ossification (IM). These unique processes\nhave varying intermediates and resulting matrices.\nLong bones form through EO where chondrocytes first create a hyaline cartilage skeleton\nwhich is then replaced with bone by osteoblasts and osteoclasts. This process is also the body’s\nmechanism of fracture healing. The EO process is much more understood than IM in terms of\nmechanism.\n\n8\nIntramembranous ossification is the direct differentiation and aggregation of stem cells\ninto osteoblasts (bone making cells) forming the bone matrix, for example the flat bones in the\nskull.13\nStudies have shown that many of the same molecules are involved in both EC and IM,\nsuggesting that comparable matrices result. One study characterized the varying molecular\nmechanisms involved in cranial IM bone compared to EO. 14 The results indicated expressions of\nsimilar pathways, but there are distinct factors and markers of the differentiation of early preosteoblasts to mature osteoblasts. Previously believed to yield comparable matrices, analysis of\nEO and IM resulting matrix were found to have different composition and structure. 15\nBelow, figure 1-3 from Rho et al. is a good visual aid to understand the different levels of\nbone structure from the macrostructure to the sub-nanostructure.\n\nFigure 1-3. Hierarchical structure organization of bone: (a) cortical and cancellous bone; (b)\nosteons with Haversian systems; (c) lamellae; (d) collagen fiber assemblies of collagen fibrils; (e)\nbone mineral crystals, collagen molecules, and non-collagenous proteins.17\n\n9\nBone cells\nBone is undergoing constant remodeling throughout the human lifespan. While juveniles\nwill experience extremely fast remodeling, this process slows and bone degrades as we age. This\nremodeling system utilizes osteocytes, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts. Osteocytes live in the bone\nand, through intercellular interactions, are thought to regulate bone remodeling and maintain the\nstructural integrity of bone. Osteoclasts, formed from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone\nmarrow, are multinucleated cells that reabsorb bone by creating an acidic interface to dissolve the\nmineral content, and then remove the collagen matrix through the release of enzymes. Finally,\nosteoblasts, formed from mesenchymal stem cells, are bone making cells that synthesize bone by\ndepositing the organic matrix osteoid (mostly collagen), where minerals crystallize. Osteoblasts\nsometimes are absorbed into the matrix they secrete and fully differentiate into osteocytes.\nOsteoclasts and osteoblasts work in a balance in bone remodeling to constantly reabsorb and\ngrow bone. Octeocytes stimulate bone growth, degradation, and control density. 17\nThere are a variety of factors that play a role in bone formation and remodeling in both\nendochondral and intramembranous ossification. These two processes result in distinctly different\ncompositions and structures and one study suggests that matrix from EC and IM bone differ\nqualitatively in their ability to induce cartilage and/or bone formation.15 Both contain major\nevents of bone development including the formation and infiltration of vasculature and the\ndifferentiation of stem cells. Key angiogenic factors include fibroblast growth factors (FGF),\ninsulin-like growth factors (IGF), transforming growth factors-ß (TGF-ß), vascular endothelial\ngrowth factor (VEGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGFR) families.18-20 In addition, hormones\nsuch as Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) and parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP), and bone\nmorphogenic proteins (BMP) play a role in bone formation and remodeling. 21-23\n\n10\nMesenchymal stem cells\nAdult mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are capable of differentiating into bone, cartilage,\nadipose, muscle, tendon, ligament, and marrow stroma.24 These cells can be found in tissues such\nas bone marrow, adipose tissue, dental pulp, cord blood, and umbilical cord.25 For bone\nregeneration the most studied source of cells is bone marrow. Due to the difficulty of harvesting\nfrom marrow, adipose derived stem cells have been used as well.26,27 Lipoaspirate contains a\nrelatively high frequency of these stem cells, and the corresponding isolation includes digestion\nof the tissue and subsequent culture to purify the stem cell colony. These stem cells demonstrate\nosteogenic lineage and this can be measured quantitatively using molecular, biochemical, and\nhistological methods.28 Stem cell phenotype can be characterized by surface markers, specifically\npositive for CD73, CD90, and CD105, and negative for CD34 and CD45. 29-34\nMSCs can be differentiated in vitro. Differentiation media containing dexamethasone\n(Dex), ascorbic acid (Asc) and β-glycerophosphate (β-Gly) is the gold standard. These three\nsoluble factors have been found to orchestrate several regulatory mechanisms over time to induce\ndifferentiation. Dex has been found to induce RUNX2 expression via the activation of\ntranscriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Dex also regulates RUNX2 activation\nvia activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway which has been found to be\ncrucial in osteogenesis.35 Further RUNX2 activity with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) has\nbeen found to be important. BMPs bind to their receptors and facilitate phosphorylation of\nSMADs 1,5, and 8 which form complexes and translocate to the nucleus where they regulate gene\nexpression of osteogenic transcription factors such as RUNX2. Asc has been found to facilitate\ndifferentiation by stabilizing collagen type 1 (Col1) production. Asc is required as a cofactor in\nthe production of collagen by enzymes that hydroxylate proline and lysine. Without Asc, proline\ncannot be hydroxylated and proper collagen chains are unable to form. Thus the role of Asc in\n\n11\nosteogenic differentiation is mainly to contribute to the secretion of Col1. Further, cellular\ninteraction with extracellular matrix proteins leads to enhanced RUNX2 activity. β-Gly serves as\na phosphate source for bone mineral and induces osteogenic gene expression by extracellular\nrelated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Inorganic phosphate enters the cell and influences the\nERK signaling pathway which has been linked to osteogenic differentiation and expression of\nosteopontin and BMP2.36 On the other hand, other studies show that ERK does not play a role in\nosteogenic differentiation, and the corresponding ERK signaling pathway is independent of\nosteogenic differentiation.37\nMSX2 is a second transcription factor involved in osteoblast differentiation, but its role\nhas had mixed findings.38,39 One study suggested that MSX2 inhibits differentiation of osteoblasts\nand its precursors, 40 while others suggest MSX2 promotes differentiation and possibly\nproliferation.41,42 It has also been linked to repression of BSP expression. 43 Numerous studies\nhave been conducted regarding the proliferation and differentiation control, but the role of MSX2\nhas yet to be fully established.\n\nThe mineral phase\nEarly theories of collagen mineralization held that classic nucleation and growth occurred\ndirectly from interstitial fluid. 44 The theory that there was a transient amorphous precursor phase\narose through studying biological calcium phosphates.45-48 Eans et al. showed that under\nsimulated physiological conditions that early precipitates were amorphous in nature and later\ntransformed into octracalcium (OCP) and then finally to hydroxyapatite. 49 The previous\nexperiments that demonstrated this amorphous phase transformation were all done in vitro and it\nwas debated whether this phenomenon actually occurs in vivo. Subsequently, utilized a zebra fish\nmodel due to its continuously growing fin bones to successfully map the amorphous calcium\n\n12\nphosphate (ACP) transformation.50 This amorphous precipitate is one of the puzzle pieces of\nbiomineralization in bone formation.\n\nMineralization signaling molecules\nAs previously mentioned there are molecules involved that signal the various bone cells\nin an osteogenic positive or negative way. These molecules are important in showing the full\npicture of cell-mediated mineralization. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but an overview\nof some important molecules:\nAlkaline Phosphatase (ALP) has been implicated in several key roles in skeletal\nmineralization in vivo, and increases in enzymatic activity correspond to an increased osteoblastic\nphenotype in vitro.51-54 ALP is an early marker of osteogenic differentiation and is commonly\nused as in characterizing an osteogenic phenotype. Mechanistically, ALP cleaves phosphate\nesters to produce free inorganic phosphate which is a main component in hydroxyapatite and is\nalso a signaling molecule that affects gene expression.55,56\nNon-Collagenous Proteins (NCP) are extracellular proteins found in bone matrix and\nhave also been found to affect the mineralization process through inhibition and promotion.\nThese NCPs include osteocalcin and osteonectin, and various small inegrin binding ligand\n(SIBLING) proteins such as bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteopontin (OPN). Sibling proteins all\nhave multiple phosphorylation sites, an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) integrin binding motif, and are\nhighly acidic.\nOsteocalcin (OC), while not a member of the SIBLING family, is an NCP found to play a\nrole in mineralization. OC binds directly to cAp depicted in figure 1-4a from Stock. It has been\nfound to be present in the surface of, outside of, and within type I collagen. In vitro it has been\nfound to delay nucleation of cAp.57 OC is proposed to play a role in remodeling as OC implants\n\n13\nstimulated bone formation, osteoclast activity and early remodeling. It was also found that OCnull mice developed higher bone mass without a change in osteoblast number, but doubling in\nosteoclast number. Further these mice didn’t respond to ovariectomy which demonstrates the\nbone resorption is not impaired.58\nBSP is expressed nearly exclusively in mineralizaing tissue.59 It can directly bind to\ncollagen through one of its several sialic acid side chains. 6 This is thought to be important for the\ninitiation of bone mineralization. Figure 1-4b from Stock et al. shows that BSP can also bind to\ncAp. Physiologically, it has been found to accumulate in spaces between collagen fibers, while in\nvitro BSP localizes to the surface of type I collagen. A study demonstrated that spontaneous hAp\ncrystal precipitation occurs in the presence of BSP, but not in the presence of OPN. 57\nOsteopontin (OPN) is a SIBLING protein found in many mineralized tissues including\nepithelial lining cells of organs and in body fluids. There are studies that point to its inhibitory\nnature, and like other SILBING proteins the effect depends on its phosphorylation level.\nDephosphorylated OPN does not inhibit mineralization while highly phosphorylated OPN has\nbeen found to promote mineralization.60,61 On the other hand, shown in figure 1-4c, OPN interacts\nwith cAp and is thought to inhibit cAp crystal growth. OPN has also been found to be enriched on\nthe surface of bone with high turnover and regulates adhesion and activity of osteoclasts. OPN\ncan be dephosphorylated by tissue nonspecific alkaline phophatase (TNAP) which reverses the\nsuppressive nature of OPN.\n\n14\n\nFigure 1-4. Schematic of protein interactions with cAp. The proteins’ carbon backbones are the\nwavy structures adjacent to the cAp, helical structures are indicated by the labeled cylinders, and\nphosphorous is indicated by P. a Osteocalcin (OC, i.e., bone Gla protein BGP) binds to the cAp\n(100) face through three neighboring c-carboxy glutamic acid (Gla) residues on the same face of\nthe alpha helix. b The acidic glycoprotein bone sialoprotein (BSP) possesses several sialic acidcontaining oligosaccharide chains (sa o). The poly glutamic acid sequences (Glu)n are thought to\nconstitute sites for cAp nucleation and binding sites with cAp. Binding sites for collagen and for\ncell attachment are also indicated. c Osteopontin (OPN) instead of (Glu)n, it contains a poly\naspartic acid sequence (Asp)n that can interact with cAp and is thought to inhibit cAp crystal\ngrowth.6\nBone acidic glycoprotein-75 (BAG-75) is another SIBLING protein that has been found\nto predict location of mineral nucleation and possibly recruit BSP.62-64 In vitro, purified BAG-75\ncan self-associate into spherical complexes and sequester milimolar levels of inorganic\nphosphate. This shows that BAG-75 locally generates high concentrations of inorganic phosphate\nfor crystal nucleation reactions.65\nIn addition to the SIBLING proteins there are other proteins that have been found to be\ninvolved with regulating matrix mineralization such as osteocalcin, SPARC (secreted protein,\nacidic, rich in cysteine) also known as osteonectin, and matrix γ-carboxyglutamic acid-rich\nprotein (MGP).\nOsteonectin is a glycoprotein that binds directly to calcium and is found in type 1\ncollagen in remodeling tissues. 66 Osteonectin-null mice demonstrated a phenotype with decreased\nbone formation and decreased osteoblast and osteoclast number. This led to a decreased rate of\nbone remodeling which caused ostopenia, and suggests osteonectin could play a role in cell\ndifferentiation.67 There are also several in-vitro studies that demonstrate osteonectin can prevent\ncrystal nucleation and slow crystal growth.\n\n15\nMGP has been found to be a mineralization inhibitory molecule that has been identified\nto generally control ectopic precipitation of mineral in soft tissues. It is an ECM protein that is\nnormally expressed in chondrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. 68 While normal at birth,\nMGP deficient mice developed severe calcification of all arteries and cartilage and died shortly\nafter.69 MGP was also found to be associated with matrix vesicle mineral mineralization which\nwill be discussed below.\n\nCell mediated mineralization\nOsteoblasts, odonoblasts (dental), and chondrocytes are known as “professional\nmineralizing cells”. Due to the scope of this study of bone mineralization only osteoblast\nmineralization will be discussed. Both intramembranous ossification and ossification during bone\nturnover are mediated by osteoblasts. Osteoblasts align along the active surface of bone matrix\nand express genes for bone matrix components and enzymes such as type I collagen, TNAP, BSP,\nOC, and OPN. The osteoblast specific transcription factor RUNX2 is associated with many of\nthese genes. As the bone matrix continues to grow, osteoblasts get trapped in their own matrix\nand terminally differentiate into osteocytes or undergo programmed cell death, apoptosis.62\nIt is important to understand the detailed mineralization mechanism for the application of\ntissue engineering physiologically relevant bone matrix. Mineralization can occur in two\nmechanisms: spontaneous mineral precipitation and infiltration of amorphous calcium phosphate\n(ACP) complex. These two processes could interact with each other and are depicted below in\nFigure 1-5 from van De Lest et al. Spontaneous mineralization could result from concentrated\ncalcium and phosphate ions initiated at the site of NCPs. Once a crystal has been initiated the\ncrystal nucleates to form the rigid mineral structure. To induce this mineralization the osteoblasts\nhave to create the environment to disrupt the equilibrium of Ca 2+ and PO43- to precipitate\n\n16\nCax(PO4) y complexes. This equilibrium disturbance can be the result of local increases in\nconcentration.56 Alteration of molecules that either inhibit or facilitate precipitation can also lead\nto mineralization. It has been shown that increases in phosphate concentration is a common event\nduring mineralization and is found on the mineral surfaces of osteoblasts. 55\n\nFigure 1-5. Mechanism of cell-mediated bone mineralization. In osteoblast/osteocytes matrix\nextracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) negatively regulates the phosphate concentration via\nFGF23 and phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on X-chromosome\n(PHEX). Increasing inorganic phosphate stimulates the expression of a number of proteins, such\nas bone sialoprotein and SPARC (secreted protein, acidic, rich in cysteine). These proteins initiate\nmineralization around type I collagen fibers by binding of calcium and inorganic phosphate.\nPropagation of mineralization is negatively regulated by phosphorylated osteopontin and dentin\nmatrix protein 1 (DMP1), which may be reversed by TNAP, or cleavage by PHEX. Severa l\nmembrane enclosed structures have been related to mineralization. (a) Formation of intracellular\nvacuoles containing mineral needles (or empty ghosts), which are excreted into the extracellular\nmatrix (ECM). Bone acidic glycoprotein-75 (BAG-75) sequesters high quantities of inorganic\nphosphate and recruits bone sialoprotein to these structures, enabling further mineralization. (b)\nMultilamellar vesicles are found in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-mineralization, and (c)\nmatrix vesicles are present in all forms of mineralization. (d) Exosomes are excreted during\nosteoblast- mediated mineralization. (e) These structures may associate with collagen fibers and\nfacilitate mineralization, resulting in mineralized collagen fibers cover with lipid vesicles.62\n\n17\nAnother main theory of cell-mediated mineralization in bone is that it initiated by\nintracellular origin. Rohde et al. proposed a novel mechanism where amorphous Ca/Pi material is\ndirectly secreted through vacuoles from the osteoblast via an exocytotic process. 70 A recent study\nby Mahamid et al. mapped the amorphous calcium phosphate transformation in a zebra fish\nmodel, and found that submicron sized packages of ACP nanospheres were delivered from inside\nthe cell into the extracellular collagen matrix. This shows that collagen is quite active in the\nmineralization process. Various other studies have shown the presence of intracellular mineral\nstructures inside vesicles from osteoblasts.63,64,71\nA detailed mechanism of collagen mineralization was recently developed by Nudelman et\nal. in vitro by substituting NCPs with either polyaspartic acid (pASP) or fetuin which are both\ninhibitors of hAp crystallization.72,73 The proposed mechanism starts with pre-nucleation calcium\nphosphate clusters which form complexes with the functional matrix (pASP in this study).\nFollowing, these negatively charged pre-nucleation clusters form loosely packed structures. Next,\ncollagen fibrils facilitate pre-nucleation calcium phosphate infiltration with their positively\ncharged regions at the border of gap and overlap zones. These nano-sized pre-nucleation clusters\ninfiltrate this positively charged region and bind to specific domains of the collagen fibrils. Once\ninside the collagen, the liquid mineral state diffuses throughout the interior of the fibril and\nsolidifies into ACP and eventually becomes oriented hAp. This demonstrates that collagen has an\nactive role in mineralization of apatite in bone formation. This is depicted in figure 1-6 from\nColfen et al.:\n\n18\n\nFigure 1-6. Mineralization of a collagen fibril. a, Calcium phosphate clusters (green) form\ncomplexes with the polymer (orange line), forming stable mineral droplets. b, Mineral droplets\nbind to a distinct region on the collagen fibres and enter the fibril. c, Once inside the collagen, the\nmineral in a liquid state diffuses through the interior of the fibril and solidifies into a disordered\n(amorphous) phase (black). d, Finally, directed by the collagen, the amorphous mineral transforms\ninto oriented apatite crystals (yellow).74\nThis mechanism of mineral droplets diffusing into the collagen fibrils is a debated topic.\nIn a recent review, Gower et al. explains that capillary forces are actually the mechanism for this\ninfiltration. She calls the mineral droplets the polymer induced liquid precursor (PILP) phase and\nproposes that this liquid like amorphous precursor is drawn into the gaps and grooves of collagen\n\n19\nfibrils by capillary forces. The previous hypothesis of the amorphous precursor simply diffusing\ninto the fibrils was not supported by experimental evidence. To support her capillary force\nhypothesis, Gower et al. tracked fluorescently labeled polyaspartate infiltration into dense\ncollagen scaffolds in a turkey tendon model. She found that the polymer diffusion alone was\nlimited, but the polymer induced in the PILP phase was transported to a much greater extent\nsupporting her hypothesis of a PILP phase. The proposed mechanism is depicted in figure 1-7:\n\nFigure 1-7. Schematic illustration of the proposed mechanism of collagen mineralization via the\nPILP process. As a scaffold, type I collagen triple-helical “molecules” self-assemble into fibrils\nthat exhibit a periodic banding pattern due to hole and overlap zones. The rods sho wn here\nrepresent the tropocollagen triple helices. (a) Nanoscopic PILP droplets adsorb to the collagen\nfibril and are drawn into the gap zones of the fibril by capillary forces. (b) The amorphous phase\nsolidifies once it has fully infiltrated the interstices of the fibril, including the gap zones as well as\nthe regions between the collagen molecules. (c) Crystallization of the ACP phase into\nhydroxyapatite leaves the fibrils embedded with nanocrystals of hydroxyapatite that are aligned\nroughly parallel to the fibril.5\nThere are numerous groups who have used collagen matrices for studying\nbiomineralization. The development of modern understanding of biomineralization has been\nachieved through understanding the structure of collagen, the amorphous mineral phase, role of\nNCPs mostly using reconstituted collagen which lacks collagen-bound macromolecules which\nexist in native tissues. 75 Most work studying biomineralization is done to understand mechanistic\n\n20\nunderpinnings and the amorphous mineral phase on a nano/micro scale with little physiological\nsignificance.7\n\nTissue engineering model\nThere has been significant work done recently to understand the mechanistic\nunderpinnings of biomineralization in hard tissues such as bone. Intrafibrillar mineralization was\nfirst demonstrated using pAsp as a substitute for NCPs. 4,44,72 These studies were essential in\nunderstanding the basic principles of mineralization such as charge interactions, inhibition of\nnucleation in solution, and stability of the amorphous phase. However, next it is important to\nunderstand the role of individual NCPs and a great deal of work has been done to study this.\nHowever most of this work was done using reconstituted collagen which lacks the physiological\nrelevance of collagen bound macromolecules found in native tissues. Therefore studies have used\ndemineralized tissue such as turkey leg tendons, demineralized bone, and periodontal\nligaments. 7,75 While these models have provided important advances in understanding\nbiomineralization, most of this work has used synthetic systems which can help provide theories,\nbut have trouble translating in vivo. A balance of both in vitro and vivo studies is required to\nunderstand biomineralization. Nudelman et al. explains that “A very important issue, and perhaps\nthe most challenging, is to understand how the different components (i.e. the collagen, the NCPs,\nand the mineral) interact with each other and function in synergy to control mineralization.”7\nDemineralized bone has been used in bone tissue engineering due to its osteogenic\npotential. Derived from actual bone, it maintains its osteoinductivity by still containing BMPs and\nNCPs such as BSP.76 These proteins can interact with the seeded MSCs and induce osteogenic\ndifferentiation and facilitate mineral formation. One study even found that demineralized\ncancellous scaffolds seeded with BMSCs implanted subcutaneously had more new bone growth\n\n21\nthan partially demineralized which had still more growth than the original fully mineralized\nscaffolds. 52 Demineralized bone has also been found to include growth factors such as VEGF,\nTGF-β. IGF-1, and FGF.77-79\nThere have been various studies that utilize demineralized cancellous bone as a substrate,\nmostly for tissue engineering applications due to its osteogenic nature.76,80-85 A great deal of these\nstudies utilize stem cells either from bone marrow (BMSC) or adipose derived (aMSC). It is also\nalready used in a clinical setting for bone regeneration, as an osteogenic mixture or “slurry” and\nnot as a graft.86 The potential of demineralized cancellous scaffold was demonstrated through\naMSC differentiation on a demineralized graft SHI, and subcutaneous implantation in athymic\nmice.51 MSC’s direct induced differentiation in osteoblasts on a demineralized graft was\ndemonstrated in the subperiosteal space of a rat calvaria. 83 Further, osteogenic induced aMSCs\nseeded on a demineralized bone matrix were used to treat a critical sized rat calvarial defect. 84 As\nthe field of tissue engineering progresses to create more and more physiologically relevant\nmaterial, these models can be used to study biomineralization and further our understanding.\nThe Vunjak-Novakovic group has done significant work in the tissue engineering of bone\nand cartilage.87-89 A novel perfusion bioreactor was used to fabricate custom bone grafts for facial\nreconstruction using autologous stem cells.90-92 The process from Bhumiratana et al. is depicted\nbelow in figure 1-8. This perfusion bioreactor system utilizes a decellularized bone structure\nwhich is a rigid scaffold taken from the native trabecular bone of bovine distal femur. This\nprocess is novel because it yields a functional living piece of bone in an anatomical shape. Other\ngroups have used mixtures or slurries of demineralized bone which, while osteogenic, lack the\nmechanical properties of whole grafts. The perfusion bioreactor system has been optimized to\nmimic anatomical shear stress and offers a physiologically relevant model to study\nbiomineralization. Using this model, work has been in studying controlled tissue matrix\nassemblies, effect of seeding density, fluid perfusion rate, and ultimately engineering anatomical\n\n22\nshaped human bone grafts.87-92 The process is depicted below in figure 1-8 from Bhumiratana et\nal. with application to a porcine bone graft.\n\nFigure 1-8. Fabrication of engineered bone grafts. (A) Personalized bone tissue engineering\nprocess. Autologous MSCs (from fat aspirates) and CT images were obtained for each animal\nsubject. The anatomical scaffold was fabricated from the bovine stifle bone that had been processed\nto remove any cellular material while preserving the tissue matrix. The cells were seeded into the\nscaffold and cultured in the specially designed perfusion bioreactor. After 3 weeks, the engineered\nRCU was implanted back into the pig for 6 months. (B) The bioreactor culture chamber consisted\nof five components designed to provide tightly controlled perfusion through the anatomical\nscaffold: anatomical inner chamber with bone scaffold, two halves of the polydimethylsiloxane\n(PDMS) (elastomer) block with incorporated channels, two manifolds, and an outer casing. The\nPDMS block was designed as an impression of the anatomical RCU structure and contained flow\nchannels at both sides for the flow of culture medium in and out of the scaffold. The flow rate\nnecessary for providing nutrient supply and hydrodynamic shear was defined by the design of\nparallel channels in the elastomer block (with the channel diameters and distribution dictated by\nthe geometry of the graft) and the fluid-routing manifold. The channel diameters and spacing were\nspecifically designed by flow simulation software for each pig to provide a desired interstitial flow\nvelocity for a given shape and size of the anatomical RCU. (C) Flow simulation of the medium flow\nthrough the anatomically shaped scaffold reveals uniform flow velocity throughout the volume of\nthe graft.90\n\n23\nHypothesis and specific aims\nThe proposed hypothesis is that mesenchymal stem cells will remineralize a collagen\nmatrix synthesized from demineralized bovine trabecular bone. While there has been a great deal\nof work to demonstrate bone mineralization in vitro using various chemicals in simulated bone\nenvironments at the nano/micro scale, little work has been done visualizing larger scale\nbiomineralization.93 It is important to understand biomineralization in order to develop reliable\ntissue engineering therapies. MSCs have demonstrated potential to differentiate osteogenically\nand deposit mineral. The work done in this thesis directly utilizes the tissue engineering\nprinciples developed by Bhumiratana et al. and EpiBone Inc. Utilizing the tissue engineering\nmodel with application of a perfusion bioreactor, primary aMSCs were seeded on decellularized\nor demineralized bone for the application of visualizing and quantifying the differentiation and\nbiomineralization in vitro.\nThe overall investigational approach was to first test feasibility of mineralization on\ndemineralized and decellularized scaffolds in vitro using static culture and then use a perfusion\nbioreactor to create a physiologically relevant environment and further quantify and visualize the\nmineralization.\nAim 1: Test feasibility of aMSCs to mineralize a decellularized or demineralized scaffold in static\nculture\nCells have the capability to differentiate and deposit mineral in static culture on a mineral\nscaffold. This first experiment was to test the degree of mineralization by aMSCs in either a\ndecellularized or demineralized scaffold, using scaffolds without seeded cells as a control. Other\nresearch has demonstrated similar potential with a variety of parameters, and here a baseline\ncomparison is necessary for later studies. This aim investigated the potential mineral deposition\nby the aMSCs in static culture before utilizing a bioreactor.\n\n24\nAim 2: Utilize a tissue engineering perfusion bioreactor to test mineralization on an aMSC seeded\ndemineralized scaffold\nBased on the results from the first experiment, the next aim was to focus on the\ndemineralized scaffolds for the bioreactor culture. A perfusion bioreactor was used to deliver\nosteogenic media at a controlled rate and provide shear stress to the seeded cells. This offers a\nmore physiologically relevant and effective environment for bone differentiation. These scaffold\nresults were then compared to the static culture scaffolds from the previous experiment.\n\n25\n\nChapter 2\nMaterials and Methods\n\nStem cell isolation and cultivation\nIn this study, aMSCs were either cultured in expansion media for\nisolating/plating/expanding, or in osteogenic media for osteogenic differentiation. Osteogenic\nmedia is the expansion media supplemented with 1:128,000 5mg/mL Dexamathasone (Sigma\nD2915) dissolved in EtOH, 1:20 10mM ß-Glycerophophate disodium salt hydrate (Sigma\nG9422), 1:1000 50mg/mL Ascorbic Acid (Sigma A8960) dissolved in H2O, and HEPES buffer\n(LifeTech. 15630-130).\nTo obtain aMSCs, SVF was isolated from lipoaspirate using previously described method\n[Gimble nature protocol] and plated on tissue culture plate. The cells were maintained in an\nincubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. The cell culture media was aspirated and fresh media was added\nafter 24 hours. Subsequent media changes occur every 3 or 4 days.\nFor cell passaging, once the cells reach confluence the media was aspirated and the\nadherent cells were washed in PBS. The cells were uplifted and cell detachment was verified\nunder the microscope. Once detached expansion media was added to the cells and spun down at\n300xg for 5 minutes. After aspiration the cell pellet was resuspended in fresh expansion media. A\ncell count was obtained by counting the cell suspension with 1:1 Trypan Blue (Life Technologies)\nusing the Countess II cell counter by Life Technologies. Cells were replated at a density of 5000\ncells/cm2. Scaffold fabrication and preparation\nBovine femurs (Prather Ranch, Macdoel, CA) were cleaned of excess cartilage, muscle,\nand other tissues. 8mm diameter cylinders of trabecular bone were drilled using a bone saw and a\n\n26\ndrill press. The cylinders were cut using a linear saw the resulting in disks with 8mm diameter\nand 2mm thickness.\nThe bovine bone disks were washed to remove all cellular components with several\nsuccessive solutions (all chemicals from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted). First a water jet\nwas used to remove as much blood and large debris as possible. Next, the first solution was PBS\n(HyClone GE SH30256.01) + 0.1% Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for at least one hour\nat room temperature. Solution two was DI water plus 0.1% EDTA and 10mM Trizma Base for at\nleast 12 hours on an electronic rotator. Solution three was DI water plus 10mM Trizma Base and\n0.5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 12-24 hours on a shaker. Solution four was sterile\nwater plus 10mM Tris HCL, 100 U/mL DNase I, and RNase A for at least 6 hours. Finally, the\nscaffolds were rinsed several times in DI water. Next the bone disks were freeze dried (Harvest\nRight, UT) by bringing the temperature down to -15°C with a vacuum of less than 0.03 bar for 8\nhours. Due to the nature of obtaining these scaffolds from anatomical sources, there is a variety of\ndensities and porosities between scaffolds. For the static culture experiment scaffolds with dry\nweight of 25-40 mg were used, while the scaffolds used in the bioreactors were 20-25 mg. Lastly,\nsterilization was performed by peracetic acid (REVOX, Minneapolis). To quantify bone volume\nfraction (BVF), scaffolds were sterilely imaged in the microCT scanner prior to seeding.\nDemineralized bone samples require additional steps. Sterilely, scaffolds were washed\ntwice in PBS prior to demineralization in 0.5M EDTA (Thermo Fisher 15575020) in 50mM TrisHCl (Sigma) (20mg scaffold per mL solution) for 36 hours with a solution change at 24 hours.\nStill sterile the scaffolds were washed several times in PBS and reimaged in the microCT to\nconfirm demineralization.\n\n27\nScaffold seeding and bioreactor culture\nOnce the cells had been expanded to P3 they were used to seed the 2D plates and the\nscaffolds (both decellularized and demineralized have identical seeding protocol). 2D pl ate\ncultures were seeded with 2,000 cells/cm2 in a 12 well plate (Corning) with 2mL of media per\nwell changed every 3 or 4 days for 3 weeks for both experiments. The scaffolds were rinsed twice\nin PBS and then once in osteogenic media. The scaffolds were dried by aspirating directly before\nseeding. The scaffolds were seeded at a density of 106 cells per disk (n=4 per group)\ncorresponding to a seeding density of 10 million cells per cc of scaffold volume. Assuming a 60%\nporosity, 60uL of cell suspension was dropped onto the scaffolds as they sat in a 24 well-plate\n(Corning). For the following 3 hours the scaffolds were flipped using sterile tweezers and small\nvolumes of media were added as needed to keep the scaffold wet. The scaffolds were left\novernight in the incubator in 2mL of osteogenic media before being transferred to a new plate\nwith fresh media. The scaffold controls without cells were not seeded with cells, but otherwise\nidentical protocol was followed.\nScaffolds in static culture (4 groups, Decell + cell, Decell, Demin + cell, Demin, n=4 per\ngroup) were cultured in a 6 well-plate (Corning) and the entire 10mL media was changed every 3\nor 4 days and kept in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. The scaffolds were transferred to a new\nplate once per week to ensure adherent cells on the bottom of the plate didn’t interfere with the\nresults. Scaffolds were cultured for 5 weeks in static culture for the first time point. At this time\nscaffolds were imaged under microCT and cut in half. One half was put back in culture (with\n5mL of media) while the other half was cut in half again (now two quarters of the scaffold) with\none quarter used for DNA quantitation and the other quarter for live/dead staining and histology.\nThe cultured half continued culture for 4 more weeks (to the 9 week culture time point) and\n\n28\nsubsequently imaged under microCT and cut in half (again, two quarters of the original scaffold)\nfor DNA quantization and live/dead staining histology.\nScaffolds for bioreactor culture were first cultured statically for 3 weeks prior to being\nplaced in the bioreactor (n=4). Then the scaffold was sterilely placed in a closed-loop perfusion\nbioreactor assembly (more details below) with tubes and a media reservoir. The scaffolds were\ninitially seeded with 20mL of media per bioreactor with each media change removing and\nreplacing 10mL of media every 3 or 4 days. Media samples were taken at each change for\nGlucose and ALP Quantitation. The scaffolds were cultured for 2 weeks in the bioreactor (5\nweeks total, 3 static plus 2 bioreactor), at which point the bioreactor was opened and the scaffold\nwas imaged under microCT. Next, sterilely, the scaffold was cut in half and half was put back\ninto the bioreactor with a Teflon (McMaster-Carr) half disk to force flow through the remaining\nscaffold piece. The other half of the scaffold was cut in half (two quarters of the scaffold) and\nused for RNA quantitation or histology. This half of scaffold was cultured in the bioreactor for\nthe remaining 4 weeks (9 weeks of total culture) which at this final time point was imaged in the\nmicroCT scanner and cut in half for RNA quantitation and histology.\nGas exchange occurs through the polyolefin bag (Charter Medical NC, USA) which also\nserves as the media reservoir and contains a port for media changes. The tubing is either silicone\n(Masterflex LS-16, LS-13) or PVC (Masterflex LS-14) for over the pump. The peristaltic pump\n(Masterflex) was set for 0.9mL per minute. The tubing feeds into the manifold which was CNC\nmilled Ultem (McMaster-Carr). The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (NuSil MED-6015) housing\nfor the scaffold was cast from a 3D printed resin (Formlabs). (The failed low-metal PDMS was\nSteralloy 2036 from Hapco Hanover, MA). The pump pulls media from the reservoir into the\nbioreactor chamber, through the channels and then returns it to the media reservoir.\n\n29\n\nFigure 2-1. Perfusion Bioreactor: A.

Completed perfusion bioreactor assembly opened for harvesting. C.\nClose up image of the scaffold and Teflon disk in the bioreactor chamber.\n\n30\nFlow cytometry\nThe Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system with flow cytometer add-on was used to identify\ncell population expression of various surface markers. Cells were detached, spun down at 300xg\nfor 5 minutes and resuspended in SFM media and 200,000 cells were aliquoted in a\nmicrocentrifuge tube. After spinning, the supernatant was removed and the pellet is resuspended\nin 100 μL of Cell Buffer (5067-1519, Agilent). A flow cytometry chip was primed using the\npriming solution (5067-1519, Agilent), cell buffer solution, and focusing solution. The cell\nsuspension was added in 10 μL aliquots to 6 experimental wells. To mark living cells, 2 μL of a\n1:400 Calcein AM solution diluted in Cell Buffer (L3224, Life Technologies) was added to each\nexperimental sample well. For surface marker labeling the antibodies (from BD Pharmingen) iso\ncontrol, CD34, CD45, CD73, CD90, and CD105 were diluted 1:12 in cell buffer and 2 μL are\nadded to each of the experimental wells. After incubation the chip was run and analyzed using the\n2100 Expert Software (Agilent). Flow cytometry was used to confirm the identity of the cells at\nP3 prior to seeding for both experiments.\n\nBiochemical assays\nGlucose: The media glucose level was quantified by using Gluocse LiquiColor Kit\n(Stanbio) to evaluate the cellular metabolism (n=4 for demineralized bioreactor). Samples and\nreagents were warmed to room temperature. Glucose standard were prepared by serially diluting\nthe Glucose Standard Stock Solution in DI water (1000 to 31.25 and 0 mg/L). A Biotek Synergy\nMX microplate reader was used to measure the absorbance at 500nm. After plotting a standard\ncurve absorbance values of samples were calculated to glucose concentration.\n\n31\nAlkaline Phosphatase (ALP): Media ALP content was quantified using a SensoLyte\npNPP Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Anaspec) (n=4 for demineralized bioreactor). Samples were\nthawed and centrifuged at 300g for 5 minutes to pellet cell debris. The ALP standard stock\nsolution was serially diluted using the ALP assay buffer from 100ng/mL down to 3.125ng/mL\nand assay buffer alone (0ng/mL) was used to complete the standard curve. The Biotek Synergy\nMX microplate reader was used to measure the absorbance at 405nm every 5 minutes for 60\nminutes. Results were plotted by optical density over time to determine a peak slope for each\ncondition (standard and sample). After creating a standard curve the ALP concentrations of the\nsamples was calculated.\nDNA: Samples for DNA Quantitation were weighed and then stored in TE buffer\n(200mM Tris-HCl, 20mM EDTA, PH7.5) + 0.1mg/mL proteinase K (Sigma) solution and flash\nfrozen before storage at -80°C (n=4 per group for static culture). For quantitation the Quant-iT\nPicoGreen dsDNA kit (Thermo Fisher) was used. After thawing samples were vortexed and then\nincubated at 55°C for 2 hours. Cellular scaffold samples were diluted 20x to maintain the range of\nthe standard from 1000ng/mL to 16.125ng/mL. The Biotek Synergy MX fluorescence was used\nwith excitation at 485nm and emission at 520nm. A standard curve was generated using the\nabsorbance and the relative DNA content was calculated for the samples in ng of DNA per mg of\nscaffold wet weight.\nRNA: Samples for RNA quantitation were weighed and placed in 750μL of Tri Reagent\n(Sigma T3934) and flash frozen and stored at -80°C (n=4 for demineralized bioreactor). After\ndefrosting samples were crushed using OMNI Bead Ruptor (OMNI International) at 0°C for 15\nseconds. For phase separation 200μL of chloroform (Sigma C2432) was next added to each\nsample. After centrifuging at 12,000xg for 15 minutes at 4°C the colorless top phase contained\nthe RNA and was carefully transferred to a new tube. For RNA precipitation 1μL of GlycoBlue\n(Ambion AM9515) was added to help visualize the RNA pellet. 500μL of isopropynol was added\n\n32\nand centrifuged again at 12,0000xg for 20 minutes at 4°C. For the RNA wash the pellet was\nresuspended in 1 mL of 70% ethanol and vortexed. After repelleting by spinning at 7,500g for 5\nminutes the pellets were air dried and then resuspended in 20μL of nuclease-free water. Final\nconcentration was measured by NanoDrop.\nNext cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher 4311235).\n10X RT Buffer, 25X dNTP mix, 10X RT Random Primers, MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptatse,\nand SNase Inhibitor were all added and reverse transcription was done using a Bio-Rad T100\nThermal Cycler. Using the concentrations from the NanoDrop, the volume of RNA solution for\nreverse transcriptase was determined. 1 μg of RNA per osteogenic plate was used. 96-well human\nosteogenic gene plates from Thermo Fisher were used. Each plate contains target genes\nassociated with osteoblast determination and differentiation, as well as plate and cellular controls.\nUsing custom MATLAB scripts, each array was normalized for variations in background\nusing the robust multi-array average procedure.94 For each array, housekeeping genes GAPDH,\nHPRT1, and GUSB were used for normalization. After performing a Student’s t-test between\nexperimental groups and the control group on an individual gene basis, p values were adjusted for\nfalse discovery rate (FDR) using Storey-Tibshirani’s method to improve confidence in p values. 95\nAn FDR-corrected p value and a 2-fold biological change in expression were chosen as criteria\nfor identifying genes whose expression was altered both statistically and biologically. 96\nUsing Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)\nBioinformatics Resources provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), each time point\nwas analyzed for the most enriched Gene Ontology (GO) cluster terms. 97\n\n33\nStaining and histology/immunohistochemistry\n2D staining: The 2D culture controls were cultured for three weeks at which time they\nwere stained for ALP, Alizarin Red, and Silver Nitrate staining.\nALP staining: ALP staining followed protocol from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich Proc.\nNo. 85) (n=4 for both 2D plates). In brief, wells were aspirated and fixed using a citrate\nbuffered acetone solution. For staining, a Fast Blue RR salt capsule was mixed with\nNaphthol AS-MX Phopshate Alkaline Solution and water and added to wells and\nprotected from light for 30 minutes.\nAlizarin Red: Cells were fixed using 10% Formalin (Sigma) (n=4 for both 2D\nplates). Alizarin Red S powder was mixed at a concentration of 1g/50mL of water and\nstained the cells for 1 minute. This stain is for identifying mineral, specifically calcium\nions.\nSilver Nitrate: Otherwise known as Von Kossa stain, cells were first fixed in\nformalin (n=4 for both 2D plates). 1% silver nitrate solution was added to the wells and\nincubated under direct UV for 20 minutes. To stop the reaction 5% sodium thiosulfate is\nadded. This stain is also for identifying mineral, specifically phosphate ions.\nHistology and immunohistochemistry: Constructs were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded\nin paraffin, sectioned using 5μm slices, and stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E),\nAlizarin Red, or Von Kossa. Immunochemistry (IHC) slides were stained using either Bone\nSialoprotein (BSP) (Abcam 52128), Collagen I (Abcam 34710), or Osteopontin (OPN) (Abcam\n8488). All histology and IHC staining was done by the Molecular Pathology Core, Histology and\nImmunochemistry Lab (Columbia NY, NY) (n=4 per group). Decellularized scaffolds were\ndecalcified for staining, while demineralized scaffolds were not decalcified for visualization of\nmineral deposition. IHC stains were counterstained with H&E stain. Demineralized samples sent\n\n34\nfor histology at the 5 week time point of the static scaffold experiment samples were accidently\ndecalcified by this service.\n\nMicro computerized tomography\nAll microCT scans were performed using a Bruker Skyscan 1176 (Bruker, MA).\nScaffolds were scanned before and after demineralization, first time point at 5 weeks, and final\ntime point of 9 weeks. The following settings were used for all scans: voltage 45 kV, current\n556μA, rotation step 0.400, framer averaging 2, and image pixel size 8.59μm. Each scan took\nabout 23 minutes to complete. For scanning, scaffolds were place in a petri dish with PBS and\nplaced inside the specimen holder of the microCT scanner.\nAnalysis was done using reconstruction and analysis software NRecon Reconstruction\nand CTAn, both from Bruker. Bone volume fraction was obtained by drawing a region of interest\nand a global thresholding technique with a threshold of 45. This threshold was determined based\non previous scans of both decellularized and demineralized constructs. The total BVF was\ncalculated using the global thresholding and calculating the proportion of voxels in the scan\ngreater than the threshold.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software\nInc.). Statistical analysis was carried out using Multiway Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\nfollowed by Tukey’s post hoc analysis with multiple comparisons and p<0.05 being considered\nsignificant.\n\n35\n\nChapter 3\nResults\n\nOsteogenic differentiation potential of aMSCs\n2D Culture: Both the static culture and bioreactor culture utilized primary aMSCs from\nthe same donor at identical passages (P3). For each experiment, through three weeks of\nosteogenic differentiation in 2D culture, aMSCs exhibited bone cell properties with positive\nstaining for ALP, and mineral deposition through Alizarin Red and Von Kossa staining (Fig. 3-1).\n\nFigure 3-1. 2D differentiation: Representative ALP, Alizarin Red, and Von Kossa staining from\n2D differentiation control for both experiments. Scale bar, 500μm.\n\nFlow Cytometry: Flow cytometry was conducted with the seeded cells at the beginning of\neach experiment. Both cell groups had very little positive expression of CD34 (2.1% and 2.6%)\nand no expression of CD43 (0% for both groups). Positive expression of CD75 (100% for both\ngroups), CD90 (97.4% and 99.7%), and CD105 (99.2% and 100%) was also found (Tab. 1).\n\n36\nTable 3-1. Flow cytometry: Summary of flow cytometry results for stem cell surface marker\ncharacterization of seeded cells for each experiment (%).\n\nStatic culture and decellularized scaffold\nDecellularized scaffold microCT and static culture BVF:\nMicroCT scans were taken before any culture, at 5 weeks of culture, and at 9 weeks of\nculture. The scaffold in culture from 5 to 9 weeks is half of the original scaffold. There wasn’t a\nvisible difference in bone mineral in either decellularized group over time (Fig. 3-2). Images of\nthe demineralized scaffolds will be shown later in comparison to the bioreactor cultured scaffolds.\n\nFigure 3-2. Decellularized microCT: Representative scans of cell seeded decellularized and noncell seeded decellularized static culture scaffolds initially, and after 5 and 9 weeks of culture. The\nred appearance signifies material greater than the global threshold. Scale bar, 1 mm.\nTotal mineral percentages in statically cultured scaffolds were quantified using\nBVF calculations. For the demineralized scaffolds with cells the BVF was significantly different\n\n37\nfrom the initial (0%), to 5 weeks (3.3%), and 9 weeks (7.9%). The demineralized group without\ncells remained at 0% BVF for each time point. The decellularized scaffolds with cells showed\nBVF at 34.7% initially, to 38.5% at 5 weeks, and 42.8% at 9 weeks. This corresponds to an\nincrease of 3.8% during the first 5 weeks, and a further increase of 4.3% during 5 to 9 weeks\n(total 8.1%). However, the decellularized scaffold without cells also showed increases of BVF\nfrom 33.3% initially, to 36.8% at 5 weeks, and 38.2% at 9 weeks. This corresponds to an increase\nof 3.5% for the first 5 weeks, and a further increase of 1.4% (4.9% total). The large error bars in\nthe decell + cell group is from one of the scaffolds having a much higher initial BVF than the\nother scaffolds in the group. There was no significant differences found between different time\npoints or between groups for the deceullarized scaffolds. While the mineralization in the cell\nseeded constructs was consistent increasing by another 4.3% from week 5 to 9, the non-cell\nseeded scaffolds increased by only 1.3%, but this was not found to be statistically significant.\n(Fig. 3-3).\n\nFigure 3-3. Summary of BVF calculations for static culture: BVF represented with group mean\nand error bars equal to one SD (n=4), **** = p<0.0001, two-way ANOVA with multiple\ncomparisons calculated separately for Demin + cells/Demin, and Decell + cells/Decell.\n\n38\nCell viability and DNA content:\nLive/Dead assay showed good viability in the decell + cell group (green fluorescent\nshowing live cells, and red fluorescent showing dead cells) with a large concentration of cells for\nboth time points. The 5 week time point appeared to have brighter fluorescence while the 9 week\ntime point also had visible red cells along the left edge of the scaffold and even throughout the\nscaffold. The decellularized scaffold without cells, while less bright, still had some green\nfluorescence at both time points caused by auto-fluorescence of the scaffold. Live/Dead staining\nof the demineralized groups will be discussed in comparison with the bioreactor cultured\nscaffolds (Fig. 3-4).\n\nFigure 3-4. Live/Dead stain of decellularized scaffolds: Fluorescent Live/Dead image of cells\ninside the scaffold after cultivation for 5 and 9 weeks for both groups of decellularized scaffolds\nwith grayscale of live and dead. Scale bar, 500μm.\n\n39\nFor the demineralized scaffolds with cells the DNA content decreased significantly from\n5 weeks (262.6 ng/mg) to 9 weeks (84.7 ng/mg). The amount of DNA in cell seeded\ndemineralized groups was significantly higher than non-cell seeded scaffolds at both time points\n(Fig. 3-5 left side). The decellularized scaffold saw a similar trend with the DNA significantly\ndecreasing from 5 weeks (278.1 ng/mg) to 9 weeks (183.6 ng/mg) in the cell seeded scaffolds,\nand significantly less DNA in the non-cell seeded constructs. At the 5 week time point the\nscaffolds were cut in half but all the measurements were normalized to scaffold wet weight.\n\nFigure 3-5. DNA quantitation of statically cultured scaffolds: DNA was quantified for the four\nstatic culture groups in ng of DNA/mg of scaffold at the 5 and 9 week time points. Represented as\ngroup mean with error bars equal to one SD (n=4), **** = p<0.0001, *** = p<0.001, * = p<0.05,\ntwo-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons calculated separately for Demin + cells/Demin, and\nDecell + cells/Decell.\nHistology:\nH&E staining showed no significant change in decellularized constructs without cells for\nthe duration of the experiment. For the cell seeded decellularized scaffold group the cells are\npresent, but no clear mineralization has occurred. The cell density varies throughout and appears\nto be denser adjacent to the native scaffold (Fig 3-6).\n\n40\n\nFigure 3-6. H&E staining of decellularized scaffolds: Decellularized scaffolds H&E stained\ninitially, and at 5 and 9 weeks of culture for in both decell and decell + cell groups. Scale bar,\n200μm.\n\nBioreactor culture and demineralized scaffold comparison\nDemineralized scaffold microCT and static culture BVF:\nFor the static culture experiment there was a wide range of initial BVFs for the scaffolds\nacross the groups. For the demineralized bioreactors, a smaller range of slightly lighter scaffolds\nwere used (25-40 mg vs 20-25 mg dry weight, BVF 31.9 ± 4.9% vs 24.5 ± 1.1%) (Fig. 3-7).\n\n41\n\nFigure 3-7. Initial BVF of scaffolds used in the two experiments: Scaffolds used for the second\nexperiment had a slightly lighter and tighter range of weights. Static scaffolds 25-45mg and\nDemineralized BR 20-25mg. Represented as group mean with error bars equal to one SD (n=16\nfor static culture and n=4 for Demin BR)\nMicroCT images of demineralized, demineralized + cell static culture scaffolds, and\ndemineralized bioreactor scaffolds initially, after demineralization, after 5 weeks, and 9 week of\nculture are shown in figure 3-8. All the groups showed initial mineral content with successful\ndemineralization prior to culture. In the demineralized group without cells seeded there was no\nmineral detected at either 5 or 9 weeks of culture. For the demineralized scaffolds with cells,\nthere was some mineralization toward the outside of the scaffold with no mineral appearing on\nthe inside of the scaffold. At 9 weeks there was more mineralization around the outside of the\nscaffold with minimal mineral penetrating the interior of the scaffold. For the bioreactor culture at\n5 weeks there was significant mineralization throughout the scaffold. While still more mineral on\nthe inside of the scaffold versus the outside, the mineral appears similar to the trabecular pattern\nof the initial scaffold. At 9 weeks of culture the scaffold mineralizes more uniformly throughout\nthe entire scaffold further mimicking the original trabecular pattern, with especially dense mineral\nregions forming on the outside edges of the scaffold (Fig 3-8).\n\n42\n\nFigure 3-8. Demineralized scaffold microCT: Representative scans of demin, demin + cell static\nculture scaffolds, and demin bioreactor scaffolds initially, after demineralization, and after 5 and\n9 weeks of culture. The red appearance signifies material greater than the global threshold. Scale\nbar, 1 mm.\nTotal BVF was compared for demineralized cell seeded scaffolds in either static or\nbioreactor culture. Static culture scaffolds showed significant increases in BVF from initial (0%)\nto 5 weeks (3.3%) and to 9 weeks (7.9%). Bioreactor culture also demonstrated significant\nincreases in BVF from initial (0%) to 5 weeks (14.6%) and 9 weeks (30.6%). Comparing between\ngroups the bioreactor BVF at 5 and 9 weeks of culture was significantly higher than the BVF in\nstatic culture at both 5 and 9 weeks (Fig. 3-9). BVF values summarizing figure 3-8 and 3-9 are\nshown in table 3-2.\n\n43\n\nFigure 3-9. Demineralized scaffold BVF comparison of static and bioreactor culture.

Both static (demin + cells) and bioreactor culture showed very good cell\nviability. There were some red along the outside of the scaffolds in both groups showing dead\ncells (Fig. 3-10).\n\n44\n\nFigure 3-10.

Scale bar, 500μm.\n\n45\nOne of the scaffolds from the low-metal PDMS bioreactor culture was stained Live/Dead\nand all of the cells appear to have died after originally adhering to the scaffold (Fig. 3-11)\n\nFigure 3-11. Live/Dead stain of the demineralized scaffold in the low-metal PDMS bioreactor with\ngrayscale of live and dead. Scale bar, 200μm.\nBioreactor media glucose and ALP quantitation\nGlucose levels appeared to increase slightly and stay fairly stable for the first 35 days of\nculture (0 to 14 days in static culture, and 14 to 35 days in bioreactor). After day 35 (when the\nscaffolds were taken out, imaged, cut in half, and placed back in the bioreactor) the glucose\nconsumption spiked and then decreased irregularly through the reminder of culture (Fig. 3-12A).\nALP expression decreased during the first 14 days when in static culture, but then spiked\nwhen placed in bioreactors at day 14. After decreasing fairly uniformly the ALP expression\nspiked again at day 35 when the scaffold was cut in half and placed back in the bioreactor. Again\nthe ALP steadily decreased before plateauing for the remainder of culture (Fig. 3-12B).\n\n46\n\nFigure 3-12. Bioreactor glucose consumption and ALP quantitation. Media from the bioreactors\nwas assayed for glucose and ALP levels. (A) Glucose was measured in mg of glucose consumed\nper volume of graft per day. (B) ALP was measured in ng of ALP per scaffold per day. From 0 to\n14 days scaffolds were kept in static culture, from 14-35 days scaffolds were in bioreactors, and at\n35 days scaffolds were taken out, cut in half and placed back in bioreactors for the remainder of\nthe culture period. Data presented is group mean with error bars equal to one SD.\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry:\nHistology of the initial demineralized scaffolds showed controls of H&E, Alizarin Red,\nand Von Kossa staining. The non-cell seeded scaffolds appeared identical to the initial scaffolds\nat both 5 and 9 weeks of culture. Note that 5 week time points of both cell and non-cell seeded\n\n47\nstatic scaffolds were accidently decalcified so there is no ALZ or VK stain available. H&E\nstaining showed cell and ECM accumulation within the cell seeded demineralized static scaffolds\nat weeks 5 and 9. At 9 weeks in the static demineralized scaffold, the ALZ and VK stains show\nmineralization occurring at the outside of the scaffold with little positive mineral staining toward\nthe interior of the collagen scaffold. The bioreactor culture showed similar ECM and cell\naccumulation through the H&E staining. ALZ and VK staining for bioreactor cultured scaffolds\nappeared to be more uniform throughout the scaffold when compared to the statically cultured\nscaffolds. For the bioreactor culture, the positive mineralization staining occurred within the\nscaffold structure with possibly darker staining at week 9 compared to week 5 (Fig. 3-13).\n\n48\n\nFigure 3-13. Histology of demineralized constructs before and after culture: H&E, Alizarin Red,\nand Von Kossa staining of initial demineralized, non-cell seeded demineralized, cell seeded\ndemineralized, and demineralized bioreactor cultured scaffolds. 5 week time point of demin, and\ndemin + cell constructs were accidently decalcified so ALZ and VK stains are missing. Scale bar,\n200μm.\n\n49\nFigure 3-14 compares Von Kossa stain of static (left) and bioreactor culture (right) at the\n9 week time point. Both show significant positive staining indicating the presence of\nmineralization. The static culture shows large mineral droplets forming on the scaffold and even\nforming a plate like structure toward the outside of the scaffold. The bioreactor culture shows\nmuch smaller mineral droplets localized solely in the scaffold. The color difference between the\ntwo images could be caused by the difference of magnification during imaging or variation of\nmineral matrix density. (Figure 3-14).\n\nFigure 3-14. Von Kossa stain of demineralized constructs. 9 week Von Kossa stain of static culture\n(left) and bioreactor culture (right). Scale bar 50μm.\nBSP, Col I, and OPN immunohistochemistry staining indicated increases in bone matrix\ndeposition over time in each group. For the initial scaffold there was no positive staining for any\nof the three proteins. For the cell seeded demineralized scaffolds cultured statically and in the\nbioreactor there was accumulation of each BSP, Col I, and OPN in the scaffold. Col I is found in\nthe pore space and along the outside demonstrating the secretion of ECM by the cells. For the\nstatically cultured scaffolds BSP and OPN are found in the secreted ECM in the pore space and\nalong the border of the scaffold. The darker staining in the bioreactor group indicates higher\nprotein levels for each of the three stains when compared to the static culture. The Col I is again\nfound in the pore space, but also on the surface and penetrating the native matrix. BSP is found\n\n50\nthroughout the pore space, but appears to have regions of high concentration along the surface of\nthe native matrix. OPN appears to be expressed mostly in the pore space (Fig. 3-15).\n\nFigure 3-15.

Figure 3-16 and 3-17 summarize the gene expression for 5 and 9 weeks, respectively. Of\n\n51\nthe 91 genes analyzed, there were 21 genes upregulated and 3 genes downregulated found to be\nstatistically and biologically relevant for the 5 week time point relative to the initially seeded\nundifferentiated cells. Upregulated genes included BMP4, CDH11, a handful of collagen genes,\ngrowth factors (EGFR, FGFR1, IGF1R, TGFBR2, VEGFC), MGP, MSX2, and RUNX2 among\nothers. Downregulted genes included FGF2, SMAD1, and TUFT1. For the 9 week time point, 24\ngenes were upregulated and 2 genes downregulated. Upregulated genes included BMP4, CDH11,\nseveral collagen genes, growth factors (EGFR, FGFR1, IGF1, IGF2, TGFBR2, VEGFC), MGP,\nMMP2, and MSX2 among others. The two downregulated genes were again FGF2 and SMAD1\n(Fig. 3-16A, 3-17A).\nUsing DAVID, an NIH database, gene ontology (GO) analysis for the most significantly\nenriched GO cluster terms were found for upregulated genes in both the 5 and 9 week time points\nwith some overlap in terms. Signaling was the most common GO term in both time points, with a\nvariety of cellular processes found for each including osteoblast differentiation, ECM terms, cell\nadhesion, and transcription (Fig. 3-16B, 3-17B). Specific genes in each GO group are detailed in\nthe Appendix.\n\n52\n\nFigure 3-16.

Tissue engineering as a field has attempted to\ncreate an osteogenic and integrative replacement to eliminate the inherent issues of an autograft.\nBoth decellularized and demineralized bone matrices have been studied for their graft potential.\nThis thesis investigated the mineralization of tissue engineered bone graft in vitro by comparing\ndecellularized and demineralized bovine scaffolds in static culture and in the perfusion bioreactor\nculture. The remineralization of a demineralized collagen scaffold by stem cells was visualized\nand quantified. The study demonstrated that perfusion bioreactor is more effective in inducing\nmineralization of the collagen scaffold.\n\nDecellularized bone constructs in tissue engineering\nBone grafts made from decellularized bovine trabecular bone have been used in tissue\nengineering purposes.2,87,90,91 They offer an osteoinductive and osteoconductive graft with\npotential for osteointegration. Groups have added various cell types and growth factors/proteins\nto enhance these properties and use the decellularized bone as a scaffold. Our group with\nBhumiratana, and originally from Vunjak-Novakovic, has seeded aMSCs and developed the\nperfusion bioreactor system used in this thesis.87-92\nGrayson et al. used decellularized bone grafts in a large custom anatomical shape and\nshowed the superiority of the bioreactor culture to the static culture using microCT scans. 90 He\ndemonstrated greater osteogenicity throughout the scaffold, and hypothesized the large graft was\nlimited in static culture due to relying on diffusion of nutrients and waste into and out of the\n\n55\ncenter of the scaffold. The perfusion bioreactor solves this problem by forcing culture media\nthroughout the scaffold. A computational model was designed to deliver uniform flow and induce\nshear stress throughout the scaffold. In the comparison of static and bioreactor culture he found\nthat the bioreactor cultured constructs had significantly higher BVF after 5 weeks of culture:\n11.07% bioreactor vs 8.72% static. The BVF of statically cultured scaffolds presented in this\nthesis showed an increase of 3.8% for the first 5 weeks and then a further increase of 8.1% by 9\nweeks of culture (Figure 3-3). There were some differences between the two studies, including\nsize of the graft, seeding methods, and amount of media replaced at each media change. One\nmajor different is the cell source between the two studies. The cells used in this thesis were\nadipose derived (aMSCs) while he used bone marrow derived stem cells (bmMSCs). aMSCs have\nbeen shown to be inferior in osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation, when compared to\nbmMSCs, which could contribute to the discrepancies of resulting BVF values.98 In addition,\nGrayson et al. only changed 50% of the media (versus bulk media change), which could result in\nmore osteogenic factors secreted by differentiating osteoblasts to remain in the culture. However,\nan obvious complication has to do with the microCT scanning and processing; it is impossible to\ncompare numeric results between studies, due to the vast possibilities of scanning parameters and\npost processing. There is no evidence of a control without cells being used by Grayson et al. for\neither the static or bioreactor culture. We found that in the static culture of decellularized scaffold\nsaw an increase in BVF even when it wasn’t seeded with cells. Both cell and non-cell groups had\nvery similar BVF increases from 5 to 9 weeks showing the cells didn’t have an effect on the\nmineralization. It is hypothesized that the mineralization increase was from passive\nmineralization. The constant source of calcium and phosphate ions from the media formed\nmineral in the classical form of crystal growth in the already formed hAp crystals on the\ndecellularized scaffolds. The mineral formation corresponding to the increases in BVF was not\nevident in the microCT scans for either group of decellularized scaffolds detailed in this thesis\n\n56\n(Figure 3-2). Grayson et al. demonstrated the potential of the perfusion bioreactor and reference\nfor the seeded culture of MSCs on a deceullarized scaffold. 90\nThe DNA content and live/dead stain were used to measure of the amount of aMSCs that\nare still living and potentially differentiating and depositing mineral on the scaffold. The DNA\ncontent decreased from 5 to 9 weeks for the cell seeded decellularized scaffolds by a significant\namount (Figure 3-5). As expected, the non-cell seeded scaffolds were significantly lower at both\ntime points, but were non zero. While this could just be noise, it could potentially be explained by\nosteocytes being trapped in the matrix through decellularization and being unearthed during\ngrinding of the scaffold prior to the assay. The live/dead staining revealed that in the cell seeded\nscaffolds there were huge amounts of cells, but at the 5 week time point there was more intense\ngreen fluorescence corresponding to living cells (Figure 3-4). This is consistent with the DNA\nquantitation results. The 9 week also had a strip of dead cells along the edge with some\nthroughout the scaffold. Prior to the live/dead stain the entire scaffold was placed in PBS and\nimaged in the microCT scanner. Then the scaffold was cut in half using a scalpel and stained in\nthe live/dead solution for 20 minutes before imaging. During this 45 minutes process, the scaffold\nwas at room temperature and without cell media. This could have led to dead cells especially\naround the outside of the scaffold. The large amount of dead cells along the one side of the 9\nweek scaffold could have been caused by the cutting of the scaffold (only one cut at 9 weeks).\nHowever, if that was the case, we would expect that to be true for both sides of the 5 week sample\nwhere it was cut along both sides before staining. Also, the radiation effect from the microCT\nscan could potentially have caused the change in DNA content and live/dead staining.\nThe potential to use microCT imaging analysis as a nondestructive and quantitative\nmethod to measure mineralization on a three-dimensional scaffold in vitro was previously\ndemonstrated. 99 Cartmell et al. seeded various synthetic scaffolds as well as demineralized bone\nwith rat stromal cells. Starting at week 4, a construct from each group was imaged and then\n\n57\nreturned to culture. Each subsequent week the original scaffold(s) was imaged as well as another\nfrom each group through the 8 weeks. While is hard to directly compare increases in\nmineralization due to their normalization to scaffold porosity, the experimental model allowed\nthem to show that the repeated microCT scanning had no effect on the amount of mineral matrix\ndeposited. There is no detail of the numeric parameters used in the microCT scanning, and it is\nquite difficult to compare without being able to quantify the amount of radiation. There is also no\ndata on the number of cells after seeding.\nThere are numerous studies with mixed conclusions of the effect of irradiation on\nmesenchymal stem cells. Irradiation was found to effect growth and differentiation (including\nontogenesis) of MSCs100, and low doses were found to trigger senescence with minimal\ncontribution to apoptosis101. On the other hand, Maria et al. found irradiation exposed adipose\nderived MSCs maintained stem cell phenotype and underwent necessary DNA repair102, and\nirradiation was to have no difference on viability but did increase population doubling time. 103\nFurther, stem cells were shown to be resistant to radiation104, sustained differentiation potential105,\nand even at high radiation maintained stem cell characteristics.106 All of these studies were done\non cells alone, and it is problematic to compare these studies due to the varying irradiation\nsources and dosing. 107,108\nWhile we did not perform a dosing study to quantify the amount of radiation being\ndelivered to each scaffold, we used a microCT scanner designed for low dosing in vivo scanning\n(Bruker SkyScan 1176). While this isn’t sufficiently quantitative, we attempted to keep the\nradiation to a minimum by using only 45 kV for the voltage source (above studies used up to 10\nMV) and the scans to 23 minutes each. The potential for the microCT scans to affect the cell\nviability from 5 to 9 weeks is entirely possible. Cells that die during the scanning, cutting, or final\n4 weeks of culture will remain in the scaffold and appear in the live/dead imaging. Another\npossibility for lower cell counts at 9 weeks could be the differentiation of the aMSCs. Osteoblasts\n\n58\neither trap themselves in their osteoid matrix and terminally differentiate into osteocytes or\nundergo programmed cell death, apoptosis. It has been theorized that dying cells may concentrate\nmineral ions109, and act as a nucleator for crystal formation.110 Both of these explanations of cell\ndifferentiation and cell mediated mineralization are difficult to believe without visible mineral\nformations. Histological analysis showed the accumulation of cells in the pore space in the cell\nseeded scaffolds (Figure 3-6). However, there is no evidence of mineral matrix deposition. The\ndecellularized matrix without seeded cells looked identical at all of the time points and also fails\nto show any additional mineral formation.\n\nRemineralization of demineralized collagen scaffold\nOverall, the mineralization of the decellularized scaffolds didn’t reveal decisive\ndifferences compared to the controls and it proved difficult to visualize any mineralization. While\nthe goal of the company where this research was conducted is to create anatomical bone grafts\nfrom decellularized bone we focused on studying biomineralization through demineralized\nscaffolds due to the obvious mineral deposition and definitive difference to the control. The next\nstep used the demineralized scaffolds in the perfusion bioreactor (Figure 2-1) and compared the\nbioreactor cultured scaffolds to both the cell seeded and non-cell seeded statically cultured\nscaffolds.\nLessons learned from the first experiment led us to alter the range of initial scaffold\nweights. The wide range of scaffold BVFs was visually distinguishable in microCT scans. Some\nscaffolds had close to 40% BVF with a dense matrix. For the second experiment with bioreactors,\na smaller range of weights was chosen with slightly lighter scaffolds (Figure 3-7).\nWith the first experiment being a feasibility test, the bioreactor experiment was designed\nto compare scaffolds cultured statically and in the perfusion bioreactor. Originally, the intent was\n\n59\nto live-image the scaffolds in bioreactor culture at various time points. The normal bioreactor\nused platinum cured PDMS which created too much interference in microCT scans. Low-metal\nPDMS was tested for feasibility in scanning and had much less interference with the scaffold.\nThis PDMS had previously been found to be biocompatible. 111,112 To test the biocompatibility, we\nsoaked the low-metal PDMS in media and subsequently used it on plated cells. After another\nmedia change the cells showed no visible difference in morphology or cell death, serving as a\nrough biocompatibility test. The experimental design was to have scaffolds grown statically and\nin low-metal PDMS bioreactors in parallel, but it was found that the scaffolds in the bioreactor\nwere not consuming glucose or expressing ALP. This could have been due to the low metal\nPDMS leaching toxins or due to the flow from the perfusion bioreactor dislodging the cells. The\ncells had been seeded overnight on the soft demineralized scaffold and might not have attached as\nwell as they had on the decellularized scaffold. To avoid both of these potential problems the\nscaffolds that were still in static culture, and serving as a comparison, were continued in static\nculture for 2 weeks before being put in a bioreactor with platinum cured PDMS and a lower flow\nrate. The lower flow rate was used to ensure that the cells had properly attached to the scaffold.\nOne of the scaffolds from the original low-metal PDMS bioreactors was stained using live/dead\nafter a week in culture without consuming glucose and no expression of ALP (Figure 3-11). All\nof the cells appear to be dead but attached to the scaffold which points to the fact that the cell\nattachment on the soft matrix in the perfusion bioreactor was not the issue. Thus we were forced\nto compare the bioreactor cultured scaffolds to the static cultured scaffolds from the previous\nexperiment.\nThe perfusion bioreactor offered a better culture method resulting in greater mineral\ndeposition throughout the entirety of the scaffold. The microCT scans of the cell seeded\ndemineralized scaffold in static culture showed mineralization solely on the perimeter of the\nscaffold (Figure 3-8). This is similar to the findings of Cartmell et al. which were discussed\n\n60\nearlier, with seeded rat stromal cells on demineralized scaffolds for static culture, where the\nmineralization was localized along the periphery. This is an expected result for the static culture\nof a three-dimensional structure due to sole diffusion and subsequent limited transport of\nnutrients and waste throughout the entire scaffold. While the method of the cell seeding with\npipetting cells and multiple scaffold flips attempts to deliver cells throughout, cells are most\nlikely to be concentrated at the surface. Further, as the aMSCs proliferated and differentiated,\nthey secreted a great deal of ECM which has the potential to be mineralized. This could\ncontribute to the sole mineralization of the outside even where the native scaffold was not. The\nnon-cell seeded demineralized constructs did not demonstrate mineralization unlike the results\nfrom Cartmell et al. which showed partial mineralization of the collagen matrix confirmed by\nhistology. There were several differences between the experiments that could account for this\ndiscrepancy. In addition to different microCT scanning and analysis protocols, the\ndemineralization procedure was completely different (sodium citrate and formic acid versus\nEDTA and Tris-HCl) which might result in a dissimilar matrix that could induce mineralization\nwithout cells. The culture media they used also contained fetal bovine serum (FBS). We found\nthat the bioreactor cultured scaffolds showed mineralization throughout the scaffold in the\noriginal trabecular pattern. There are some dense areas along the edge of the scaffold which are\npotentially more mature mineral matrix.113 It is expected that on the exterior of the scaffold there\nis more mineral in the 5 week scaffolds, and denser mineral at 9 weeks because these scaffolds\nwere cultured statically for 2 weeks in the beginning. The difference in mineralization patterns\nare obvious with the static culture forming mineral along the outer border and the bioreactor\nculture remineralizing the collagen matrix in the original trabecular pattern.\nWhile the pattern was distinct between culture methods the amount of mineral was\nmarkedly different (Figure 3-9, summarized in Table 3-2). The scaffolds in static culture\nmineralized 3.3% at 5 weeks and reached 7.9% after 9 weeks while the bioreactor culture yielded\n\n61\n14.6% at 5 weeks and reached 30.6% by 9 weeks. The static demineralized culture results from\nCartmell et al. are again difficult to compare with our results because they normalized the\nmineralized matrix to the scaffold porosity, which is puzzling because they demineralized the\nscaffold and mineralization appears to occur in the collagen matrix as well as the empty pore\nspace on the outside of the scaffold. Mentioned earlier, Mauney et al. demonstrated that BMSC\nseeded demineralized scaffolds implanted subcutaneously had more new bone growth than\npartially demineralized and fully mineralized scaffolds experienced the least new bone growth.\nThey normalize to total potential area of tissue ingrowth but do not provide the porosity of the\noriginal scaffolds. Discussed earlier, Grayson et al. found an increase in BVF of 11.07% at 5\nweeks of bioreactor culture with decellularized scaffolds, while in this thesis we found an\nincrease of 14.6% at 5 weeks of culture with demineralized scaffolds (2 weeks static and 3 week\nbioreactor). This trend is consistent with the trend found by Mauney et al..52,90,99\nVisualization of the mineralization by histology accurately correlates with the results\nfound in the microCT analysis (Figure 3-13, 3-14). The 9 week cell seeded static culture showed\nremineralization toward the exterior of the scaffold with some mineralization occurring along the\nperimeter of the scaffold, visible using Von Kossa and alizarin red staining (unfortunately the 5\nweek time point was accidently decalcified). The alizarin red is not positive stained in the inside\nof the scaffold, while the Von Kossa staining shows much less concentrated mineral toward in the\ninside. The difference between these two mineral stains is that ALZ specifically targets calcium\nions, while VK targets phosphate ions. The small amount of mineral in the static cultured scaffold\nvisualized throughout by the VK stain could be immature mineral of magnesium phosphate which\nexplains why the VK stain is positive and the ALZ is negative. There is a border of what appears\nto be a cell ECM blend along the outside of the statically cultured scaffold. The mineralization\nalong the outside of the scaffold is not remineralization of the scaffold, but seems to be\nmineralization of the ECM secreted by the aMSCs. The bioreactor cultured constructs show\n\n62\ndefinitive remineralization of the native matrix through the corresponding ALZ and VK staining.\nThere is still a large accumulation of cells and ECM seen in the H&E stain, but mineralization is\nlocalized to the collagen matrix. There is accumulation of BSP, Col I, and OPN in the cell seeded\nscaffolds evident from the IHC staining (Figure 3-16). The positive Col I staining in the native\nmatrix show that the cells remineralized the scaffold while secreting ECM. BSP staining on the\nsurface of the native matrix could be bound to either the surface of the type I collagen or directly\nto cAp. While OPN’s inhibitory nature depends on its phosphorylation level, it binds directly to\ncAp. The accumulation of OPN in the pore space could be binding and inhibiting immature\nmineral cAp growth, or simply be trapped in the ECM secreted by the aMSCs Previously, it was\nfound that undifferentiated cells did not express BSP or osteocalcin which supports the\nhypothesis that the cells stained above are differentiating. 114\nLive/dead staining demonstrated huge numbers of cells on both cell seeded groups\n(Figure 3-10). Here there is still a strip of dead cells along the perimeter of the scaffolds which\ncould potentially result from the cutting of the scaffold, imaging of the scaffold, or the amount of\ntime out of culture, all which were discussed earlier.\nGlucose consumption was used as a measure of cell metabolism while ALP expression\nwas used as an early marker of osteogenic differentiation (Figure 3-12).115 The glucose\nconsumption spike at week 5 was unexpected. We expected the consequence of dead cells from\nthe imaging and cutting of the scaffold to result in decreased consumption. The consumption\ncame back down shortly but was still higher than prior. ALP content in the media has been used\nas an early marker of osteogenic differentiation, and we expected to see a peak within the first\nweek or two of culture which is possibly the spike at day 7. Following placement in the bioreactor\nwe saw huge spikes of ALP in the media at week 2 and week 5. While we hoped ALP levels\ncould demonstrate the differentiating potential that the perfusion flow delivers, a more likely\nscenario is that the spike is due to dead cells dislodged by the flow and released into the media.\n\n63\nALP is secreted in the media, but it is also active within cells and we have found that dead cells\nand cell debris interfere with ALP quantitation (unpublished results).\n\nBioreactor cultured aMSC gene expression\nThe goal of this thesis was to visualize and quantify biomineralization. Aiming to delve\ndeeper, gene expression was analyzed in an attempt to understand the stem cell differentiation. At\n9 and 5 week time points, the increased expression of BMP4 and a smattering of collagen genes\nwas expected in osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.116 Interestingly the gene for BSP (IBSP) was\nnot found to be upregulated at week 5 or week 9 yet its expression was evident from IHC\nstaining. Additionally, the gene for OPN (SPP1) was upregulated at week 5, but not at week 9.\nStiehler et al. previously quantified relative expression of early (RUNX2), intermediate (ALPL),\nand late (BGLAP, osteocalcin) osteogenic markers. 81 He found increased RUNX2 expression,\nconsistent expression of ALPL, and increasing expression of BGLAP for the 6 weeks of culture.\nWhile there was no evidence of upregulation for either ALPL or BGLAP, we found significantly\nupregulation of RUNX2 at week 5 but not week 9. This is consistent with the thought process of\nRUNX2 being an early differentiation marker and with the results from Stiehler et al. While\nessential in osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, Komori et al. explains that RUNX2 expression\nhas to be downregulated for differentiation into mature osteoblasts. 38 The fact that RUNX2 is not\nfound to be upregulated at 9 weeks despite the continued media supplement with Dex shows the\nMSCs are maturing along the osteogenic lineage. As discussed earlier, Abzhanov et al.\nsummarized the expression pattern for differentiating osteoblasts. 14 RUNX2 expression\nupregulated at 5 weeks but not at 9 weeks points to the fact that the cells are differentiating and\nare closer to mature osteoblasts. Further, expression of BMP4 is found in pre-osteoblasts and\nchondrocytes-like-osteoblasts and lines up with our expression data. Abzhanov et al. claimed the\n\n64\nexpression of OPN in chondrocyte-like-osteoblasts and mature osteoblasts, but not preosteoblasts. This is contradictory to our results with OPN (SPP1) upregulated at week 5 but not at\nweek 9. The other factors outlined were not studied in the scope of this thesis. Cellular gene\nexpression is not definitive of differentiation or phenotype, and while it is important to draw\ncomparisons, it is difficult to make conclusions.\nGene ontology analysis showed the various cellular processes occurring at week 5 and\nweek 9. Cluster terms relating to ECM and collagen were found, explaining the phenotype\ndemonstrated by the secreting differentiating cells. These clusters contained genes across the\ncollagen family as well as other upregulated genes. An expected cluster from both time points\nwas osteoblast differentiation. This cluster contained genes such as BMP4, RUNX2, MSX2, and\nTWIST1, but more of genes in this cluster were found at 5 weeks.\nAt both 5 week and 9 week time points, the MSCs cultured on the demineralized scaffold\nin the perfusion bioreactor had MGP and MSX2 unregulated compared to non cell seeded cells.\nAs discussed, both of these genes have inhibitory or mixed findings detailing their roles in the\nosteogenic process.\nMGP is found to inhibit mineralization, particularly controlling ectopic precipitation in\nsoft tissues.69,117 Despite the inhibitory nature of MGP, we still found increased mineral\ndeposition through the duration of the culture. In the comparison drawn by Cancela et al., MGP\nand osteocalcin (OC) were found to be structurally similar vitamin K-dependent proteins, and\ndespite their evolutionary proximity their functions were not redundant. They found MGP to not\nonly inhibit tissue mineralization, but also cell differentiation and proliferation. This effect was\nmediated by MGP’s proven ability to bind BMP and thus mediate following signaling\ncascades.118 While its inhibitory nature is well established, MGP has been found to be\nupregulated in differentiating chondrogenesis-induced and osteogenesis induced bMSCs. 119\n\n65\nMSX2 is a transcription factor involved in osteoblast differentiation with controversial\nfindings. One study concluded calvarial osteoblast derived from MSX2 deficient mice have lower\nrate of proliferation and increased osteoblastic differentiation compared to wild type. 120 MSX2\nwas also found to play a role in regulating bone development, particularly cranial bone, and in a\nsimilar manner to RUNX2, expressed in proliferative phase of calvarial osteoblasts but\ndownregulated as differentiation progressed.121 Zhang et al. used upregulation of MSX2 as a\npositive mineralization marker in aMSCs which were osteogenically induced by β-Gly, Dex, in\naddition to exogenous factors VEGF and BMPs.122\nGene expression reveals a snapshot of the cell genotype to phenotype translation and its\ninherent depth contributes to the complex analysis. The goal of this thesis was to quantify and\nvisualize biomineralization, and gene expression was measured to open to door for further\npursuits. A more detailed validation through proteomic analysis and controlled experiments is\nneeded to confirm the presence of RNA and subsequent proteins.\n\nConclusion\nThe remineralization of a collagen matrix in a physiologically relevant manner through\ncell mediated mineralization relies on the ability of stem cells to generate native tissue\narchitecture through a suitable culture environment. Both decellularized and demineralized\nscaffolds were first tested for feasibility of mineralization in static culture (aim 1) with the results\ninfluencing the decision to focus on demineralized scaffold culture. This thesis demonstrated the\nability to mineralize a demineralized biologically-derived scaffold on the macro scale using an\nadvanced bioreactor system (aim 2). Mineralization was quantified and visualized, and results\nwere compared to static culture methods. Stem cell differentiation was studied using gene and\nprotein expression for a brief look into the biological underpinnings of controlled\n\n66\nbiomineralization. As fabricated mineralized collagen becomes better understood, laboratory\ntissue engineering work will translate into improved clinical applications.\n\n67\n\nReferences\n1.\n\nWeiner, S., & Wagner, D.
