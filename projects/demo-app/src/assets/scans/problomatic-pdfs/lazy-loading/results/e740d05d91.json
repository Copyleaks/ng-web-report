College, Itarsi (M.P.), India\nAbstract\nResearch on a new metaheuristic for optimization is often initially focused on\nproof of concept applications. Time and cost are the most important factors to be\nconsidered in every construction project. Over the years, many research studies\nhave been conducted to model the time-cost relationship. Construction planners\noften face the challenge of optimum resources utilization to compromise between\ndifferent and usually conflicting aspects of projects. Time, cost and quality of\nproject delivery are among the crucial aspects of each project. Ant colony\noptimization, which was introduced in the early 1990’s as a novel technique for\nsolving hard combinational optimization problem, finds itself currently at this\npoint of its life cycle. In this paper, new metaheuristic multi-colony ant algorithm\nis developed for the optimization of three objectives time-cost quality with\nquantity as a trade off problem. The model is also applied to two objectives time\n– cost trade off problem and the results are compared to those of the existing\napproaches.\nKeywords:\n\nTime-cost-quality-quantity trade-off, Multi-objective optimization,\nMulti-colony, Ant-Colony optimization\n\n774\n\nR.

Many organization are making use of\nCPM techniques for effective management and control of their constructive\nprojects.\nConstruction planners generally face the challenge of the optimum\nresource utilization with the link between different. Project paratmeters,\nespecially time and cost. Recent trends consider the quality and quantity of goods\nin addition with time and cost. This new feature pressurize in decision making\nconstruction industry to search optimal. Resource utilization plan which\nminimizes the construction cost and the time. It also depends on the quality and\nquantity of the products with respect to available resource create emerging needs\nfor developed. Resources utilization models that are capable of the optimizing the\nmultiple and conflicting objective of construction of time – cost, quality and\nquantity.\nThe complexities of the present day management problems and the\nbusiness competitions have added the pressure on decision makers. So if the time\ninterval of the activities is minimized we see the cost will increase due to more\nresources allocation in rapid accomplishment for the completion of work. We\nwill also see that a few of the resource will extend a complete product in longer\nduration of activities. Every resource utilization option will end a specific\nperformance quality with respect to time – cost and quality in addition with\nquantity.\nTrading between these conflicting aspects of project is a most challenging\njob to construction planners. Therefore they plan to numerous combination\npossible for project delivery. A most applicative searching means will then be\nworthwhile for comprehensive and appropriate finding having efficient time,\ncost, quality and quantity trade-off problem.\nWe will compare all these results illustrating capabilities of the present\nmethods in generating the optimal solution, this model will also be helpful in two\nobjective, time- cost trade off problem. A comparative study will also be done\nwith existing approaches and a graphical representation will also be shown.

When Elrayes and Kandil has given their research\nin the field of multi objective genetic algorithm. In this paper, a new approach is\napplied for optimization of four objectives time – cost quality – quantity problem\nusing MOACO-algorithm.\nMOACO ALGORITHM\nTECHNIQUES\n\nFORMULATIONAL\n\n&\n\nPROBLEM\n\nSOLVING\n\nOperational research is a problem solving and decision making science. It is a kit\nof scientific and programmable rules providing the management a ‘quantitative\nbasis’ for decision regarding the operations under its control. A model is never a\nperfect representation of reality. But, if properly formulated and correctly\nmanipulated, it may be useful in predicting the effect of changes in control\nvariable on the over all system effectiveness. We have here the Ant colony\noptimization algorithm, inspired by the fact that ants are able to find the shortest\nroute between their nest and a food source, even though they are almost blind (\nDorigo et al (6) ).\nGenerally in ant colony optimization we employ a finite size of artificial\nants with defined characteristics for the search of the good quality solution to the\nproblem. Initially each ant collects the information on its own performance and\n\n776\n\nR. Shrivastava, S. Singh and G. C. Dubey\n\nuses this information to modify the representation of the problem (Dorigo et al\n(6) ). Artificial ants are permitted to release pheromone while developing a\nsolution or after fully developed solution or both. Rapid drift of all the ants\ntowards the same part of the search is avoided by employing the stochastic\ncomponent of the choice decision policy and the pheromone evaporation\nmechanism.\nThe pheromone persistance coefficient ( ) is defined which enable greater\nexploration of the search space and minimizes the chance of premature\nconvergence to suboptimal solutions also let ij(t) be the total pheromone\ndesposited on path ij at time t, and ij (t) be the heuristic value of path ij at\naccording to the measure of the objective function. Transition probability from\nnode i to node j at time period t may be defined as ( Dorigo et al. (7)) :\n\nR|\nP (t ) S\n|T\n\nij\n\n(t )\n\nij\n\n(3)\n\nij\n\nij\n\n(t )\n\n(t )\n\nij\n\nif j allowed\n\n(t )\n\ni allowed\n\n0\n\notherwise\n\nWhere\nand\nare parameters that control the relative importance of the\npheromone trail versus a heuristic value.\n\nRS\nT\n\nj\n\n(4)\n\narg max\nJ\n\ni allowedk\n\n{\n\nil ( t )\n\nil ( t )\n\n}\n\nIf q ≤q0\nOtherwise\n\nWhere j = a random variable selected according to the probability distribution of\nPij(t), let q be a random variable uniformly distributed over [0, 1], and q 0 [0,1]\nbe a tunable parameter. The next node j that ant k chooses to go ( Dorigo et al (6)\n).\nij\n\nIteration\n\n(t 1)\n\nij\n\n(t )\n\nij\n\n(5)\n\nWhile all the ants complete their tour is the colony. The updating is done by the\nIteration\n\nabove equation where 0\n\n1.\n\n= evaporation (i.e.,loss) rate, also symbol\n\nshows the next Interation and\n\nij\n\nR| Q\nS| nf (k )\nTO\n\nij shows the updating value.\n\nIf edge (i, j) is transuessed by the Kth ant\n(6)\nOtherwise\n\nMulti objective optimization\n\n777\n\nWhere Q is constant, showing the amount of pheromone an ant on the path after\nan exploitation, and f(k) is the value of objective is each iteration and n is the\nnumber of objective.\n2.2 Multi Objective Optimization\nAdding more than one objective to an optimization problem adds complexity. For\nexample, if you want to optimize a structural design, you would want a design\nthat is both light and regid. Because these two objective conflicts, a trade exist.\nThere will be one lightest design, one stiffest design, and an infinite number of\ndesigns that are some comprise of weight and stiffness. This set of trade off\ndesign is know as pareto set. The curve created plotting weight against stiffness\nof the best designs is known as pareto fronter.\n2.3 Dominated and Non dominated solution:\nA design is judge to be pareto optimal if it is not dominated by other design, a\npareto optimal design must be better than another design in at least one aspect. If\nit is worse than another design in all aspects, then it is dominated and is not\npareto optimal.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ASSERTED PROBLEM & FORMULATION:\n\nA network is a graphic representation of a project’s operation and is composed of\nactivities and events that must be completed to reach the end objective a project,\nshowing the planning sequence of their accomplishment, their dependence and\ninter relationships. In order to apply ACO algorithm to a specific problem, the\nproblem should be represented as graph or similar structure easily covered by\nants, as shown in figure. In which a project with N activities and K resource\nutilization option is characterized. Horizontal axis represent the activity numbers.\nA activity is a task, which lies between two events, called the presiding and\nsucceeding one.\nAn activity is represent by an arrow with its head indicating the sequence\nin which the events are to perused such it cosumes no time. An event represent\nthe start. An event is generally represented on the network by a circle, rectangle\nor some geometric shapes. For more illustration and future reference a vector is\ndefined for each possible solution that demonstrates the options of resource\nutilization for all activities respectively. For example mentioned vector for the\nroute identify in figure below be V = [2, 3, 2, k, 1]\n\nResource Utilization Option\n\n778\n\nR. Shrivastava, S. Singh and G. C. Dubey\n\nK\n\nActivities\n\nFigure: Graph representation of problem for a project with N activities and\nK-resources utilization options.\nOperational research tries to find optimal solution taking all the factors of the\nproblem into account, present day. Problem involve numerous such factors, it\nmainly concentrates on selecting appropriate options for every activity to obtain\nthe objective of time, cost and quality of a project. The objective fo time may be\nexpress as.\n\nT\n\nwhere ti(k)\nxi(k)\n\nMax\nLk l\n\nLM t x OP\nN\nQ\n(k ) (k )\ni\ni\n\n(1)\n\ni Lk\n\n= It represents the duration of activity i when performing kth option.\n= It represents the index variable of activity I when performing kth\noption.\n\nIf xi(k) = 1, the activity i perform the kth option, while xi(k) = 0 means not. The sum\nof index variable of all points/ options should be equal to 1 Lk means the activity\nsequence on the kth path, and Lk = {i1k, i2k, .............. ink} where ijk represent the\nsequence number of activity j on the kth path. L stand for the set of all paths of a\n\nMulti objective optimization\n\n779\n\nnetwork and and L = {Lk/K=1,2,.........m}, where m indicates the number of all\npaths of a network.\nThe total cost of any project consist of the direct and indirect cost\ninvolved in its execution. The cost is directly dependent upon the amount of\nresources involved in the execution of the individual activities. This is the cost of\nthe material, equipment and labour required to perform the activity. It can be seen\nfrom the direct cost time relationship shown in figure (a).\n\nCc\n\nC (Crash Point)\n\n(Normal Point)\nN\n\nCn\n\nTc\n\nTn\n\nActivity duration\n\nFigure (a)\n\nPoint N, referred to as the ‘Normal Point’ corresponds to the norm. activity time.\nIf the duration is further increased, the decrease in cost is insignificant. If it is\ncompressed beyond C, the cost increases very rapidly for significant change in\nthe activity duration. This points is called ‘Crash Point’. On the other hand,\nindirect cost is composed of the expenditure like the administrative expenses,\nlicense fee, insurance cost and taxes and does not depend on the progress of the\nproject i.e. the longer the duration, the higher the indirect cost show in figure (b)\n\nVariable\nFixed\nTime\nFigure (b)\n\n780\n\nR. Shrivastava, S. Singh and G. C. Dubey\n\nThe sum of the direct and indirect cost gives the total project cost. As the direct\ncost decreases with time and indirect cost increase with time, the total project\ncost corve with have a point where the total cost will be minimum show in figure\n(c).\n\nTotal Cost\nIndirect Cost\nDirect cost\n\nProject Duration\nFigure (c)\n\nThe equation (b) can be forwarded to computer the total cost of the project:\n\ndci( k ) xi( k )\n\nC=\n\nT . ici( k )\n\n(2)\n\ni A\n\nWhere dci(k) direct cost of activity i under the kth option, which equal to the\nquantities of the activity multiplied by its price; ic i(k) is the indirect cost per time\nunit of activity under the kth option.\nThe quality of a product is the ‘degree of perfection’. However, Quality control is\ndefined as an industrial management technique by means of which products of\nuniform acceptable quality are manufactured. Some indicators have been\ninvestigated and identified in recent studies that were aimed at developing quality\nbased contractor pre-qualification system (Anderson and Russel [10], MinChin\nand Smith [11]). The objective of quality may be evaluated with the following\nfunction:\nL\n\nQt\n\nwti\ni A\n\nl 1\n\nwti ,l . Qik,l\n\n(3)\n\nMulti objective optimization\n\n781\n\nWhere Qki,l = performance of quality indicator (l) inactivity (i) using resource\nutilization (k); ti,l = weight of quality indicator (l) compared to other activities in\nthe project (El – Rayes [1] )\n\nCASE STUDY CALCULATIONS:\n\nNetworks provide a comprehensive study of the entire project in terms of\nprecedence and succession of various activities as well as resources available to\ncomplete the project. A Test project with detailed information as shown in Table1. The example was originally introduced by Genget al [12] and then the same\nused by Zheng et al [13] for stochastic. Construction time-cost trade off analysis.\nThe table includes the related data on different resource utilization and their\ncorresponding time, cost quality and quantity. Originally the example did not\ncontain the information about quality and quantity level of resources utilization\noptions.\n\nThe proposed Multi- colony Ant Algorithm was fed with project data as\nshown in the table 1 below. The number of ants in each colony, number of cycle\nand number of total interaction are set to 50, 20 and 60 respectively other\nparameters of algorithm are set to\n\n= 0.97, =2,\n\n=0 and the q parameter for the\n\ncolonies of time, cost and quality is equal to 10, 10000, 0.0005.\n\n782\n\nR.
