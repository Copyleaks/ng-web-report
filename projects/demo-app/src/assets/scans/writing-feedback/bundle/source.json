Baleen whales are filter feeders and have baleen plates instead of teeth. Toothed whales have teeth and hunt for their food. Baleen whales Baleen whales are the largest animals on Earth. They feed by swimming through the water with their mouths open, filtering krill and other small organisms through their baleen plates. Baleen whales include: Blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus): The largest animal on Earth, blue whales can grow up to 100 feet long and weigh up to 200 tons.

Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae): Humpback whales are known for their acrobatic behavior and their beautiful singing. They can grow up to 50 feet long and way up to 40 tons. Gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus): Gray whales are known for their long migrations from their feeding grounds in the Arctic to their breeding grounds in Mexico.

Toothed whales include: Sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus): Sperm whales are the largest toothed whales and can grow up to 60 feet long and weigh up to 90 tons.
