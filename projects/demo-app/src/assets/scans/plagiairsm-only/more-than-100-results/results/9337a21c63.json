The cumulative 10°C\nbase growing degree-days index must be at least 900 degree-days, i.e. the known empirically\ntested lower limit for growing vines for wine making.\n\nQualification\nAct respecting reserved designations and added-value claims (LARTV) (chapter A-20. 03),\nprovincial law. Quebec wine was recognized and protected as a protected geographical indication\nby the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, by a notice published in the Gazette officielle du\nQuébec on November 17, 2018 (vol 150, no 46). Part I - Quebec wine's most defining\ncharacteristic comes from its relationship with winter. Minimal temperatures in the PGI zone during\nwinter can drop anywhere from -25°C to -40°C in the southern and northern parts, respectively.\nThese dips in temperature would damage the structure of the plants if it was not protected. Hybrid\nand Vitis vinifera grape varieties, which represent the majority of plantings within the PGI zone,\nrequire adequate winter protection. The first vines planted by winegrowers were mostly French\nhybrids. Such vines must be protected in the wintertime. While snow can be a very good insulator\nwhen in large enough quantities, its presence is not always a given. This led some innovative\nwinegrowers in the early 80s to successfully test hilling vines in the existing soil. Around 30 cm of\nsoil is enough to ensure that the roots and primary buds are well protected for a gobelet training\nsystem. As other training systems (single guyot and double guyot) do not lend themselves well to\nhilling, a technique for covering vines with a geotextile was successfully tested in the 2000s.\nThanks to these winter protection techniques, winegrowers were able to plant hybrid and noble\ngrape varieties and produce the wines that have put the Quebec terroir on the map. As evidenced\n\n1,937,270\n\nTRADEMARKS JOURNAL\n\n2022-03-09\nVol. 69 No. 3515 page 835\n\nby Quebec wine's growing national and international renown, such protection techniques were\neffective in
