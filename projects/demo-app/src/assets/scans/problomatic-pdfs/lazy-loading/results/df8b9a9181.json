Les propriétés \u001cnales des réfractaires sont dictées à la fois par les propriétés de la composition et par les\nétapes du du process industriel (mélange, compactage et frittage). Le compactage peut\nconduire à des gradients de densité le long de la pièce, ce qui entraîne une discontinuité des propriétés thermomécaniques. Des e\u001borts ont été déployés pour la modélisation\ndu comportement constitutif de la compaction des pièces industrielles réfractaires par la\nméthode des éléments \u001cnis (FEM) en utilisant des modèles élastoplastiques. Cependant,\nles paramètres matériau de ces modèles doivent être identi\u001cés par des expériences complexes. La méthode des éléments discrets (DEM) peut être une alternative pour fournir\nces paramètres. La DEM peut modéliser l'étape de compactage et les propriétés mécaniques \u001cnales du composite compacté en prenant explicitement en compte la nature\ndiscrète de la poudre. De plus, la DEM peut être appliquée pour générer des équations\nconstitutives a\u001cn de simuler la compaction à l'échelle macro en utilisant la FEM. Dans\nce travail, nous développons un modèle numérique basé sur le DEM pour simuler le comportement à la compaction de poudres composites et leurs propriétés mécaniques après\ncompactage et cuisson. Il est basé sur des observations de tomographie aux rayons X,\net des données expérimentales provenant de tests de compaction et d'essais triaxiaux.\nLes paramètres d'entrée de la DEM sont calibrés sur les données expérimentales de compactage. Quatre compositions sont représentés comme un mélange de particules discrètes,\net de clusters de particules avec di\u001bérentes fractions volumiques. Le liant est représenté\npar une coque élastique souple recouvrant des particules d'alumine. Le comportement\npendant le compactage et les propriétés à vert dépendent principalement du contact entre\nces particules enrobées. Les échantillons numériques compactés sont soumis à divers états\nde contraintes complexes pour générer des surfaces de plasticité et de rupture ajustées par\nle modèle élasto-plastique Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC). Après le compactage, les échantillons numériques sont virtuellement cuits en DEM, et leur comportement à la fracture est\nétudié. Les résultats numériques sont en bon accord avec les expérimentations à la fois\nqualitativement et quantitativement. En particulier, les simulations saisissent bien l'e\u001bet\nadoucissant d'une quantité croissante de liant. En\u001cn, une tentative de modélisation du\ncomportement de la compaction du composite dans une matrice rigide à l`aide de la FEM\nest présentée. Elle utilise le modèle DPC avec les paramètres du matériau identi\u001cés par\nDEM.\n\nMot clés : Méthode des éléments discrets, composite réfractaire, compactage de la\npoudre, propriétés mécaniques des réfractaires, méthode des éléments \u001cnis.\nv\n\nAbstract\nCarbon-bonded alumina refractories are powder composites made of coarse alumina,\ngraphite \u001dakes, and a bonding matrix (mixture of \u001cne alumina grains and binder). These\ncomposites are used for steel casting applications. The \u001cnal refractory properties are\ngoverned both by the properties of the composition and by the processing stages (mixing,\ncompaction, and \u001cring). The compaction may lead to density gradients along the geometry resulting in a thermo-mechanical properties mismatch. E\u001borts have been devoted\nto modeling the constitutive compaction behavior of refractory industrial parts by the\nFinite Element Method (FEM) using elastoplastic models. However, the material parameters of such models need to be identi\u001ced by complex experiments. The Discrete Element\nMethod (DEM) may be an alternative to provide such parameters. The DEM can model\nthe compaction stage and the compacted composite \u001cnal mechanical properties by explicitly considering the discrete nature of the powder. Also, DEM may be applied to generate\nconstitutive equations to simulate the compaction at the macro scale using the FEM. In\nthis work, we develop a numerical model based on the DEM to simulate the compaction\nbehavior of powder composites and their mechanical properties after compaction and \u001cring. It is based on X-ray tomography observations and experimental data originating\nfrom compaction and triaxial tests. The mechanical input parameters of the DEM are\ncalibrated on experimental compaction data. Four compositions in DEM are represented\nas a mixture of single particles, and particle clusters with various volume fractions. The\nbinder is represented by a soft elastoplastic shell covering hard alumina particles. The\ndensi\u001ccation behavior during compaction and the green properties depend mostly on the\ncontact between those coated particles. The compacted numerical samples are submitted\nto various complex stress state conditions to generate yield and fracture surfaces \u001ctted\nwith the elastoplastic Drucker-Prager Cap model (DPC). Following the compaction, the\ncompacted numerical samples are virtually \u001cred in DEM, and their mechanical and fracture behavior is presented. The numerical results are in good agreement with experiments\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, the simulations capture the softening\ne\u001bect of an increasing amount of binder. Finally, an attempt to model the composite\ncompaction behavior in a rigid die using the FEM is presented. It uses the DPC model\nwith the material parameters identi\u001ced by DEM.\n\nKeywords: Discrete element method, refractory powder composite, powder com-\n\npaction, refractory mechanical properties, \u001cnite element method\n\nvii\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe Ph.D. is a `grand voyage' where as soon as you take the train you do not know exactly\nwhere/how you are going to arrive, but you know you are going to get there. To embark\non this journey you need to have courage and above everything, a lot of determination\nand perseverance. The landscape of this travel is rarely \u001dat. You will go through a lot of\nups and downs in the hills and knowing how to pass through these downs will determine\nhow persistent you are. In fact, I believe that you'll have more downs than ups during\na Ph.D., so be prepared for them and do not give up. In the end, all the e\u001bort will be\nrewarded. The valuable skills you develop during this period will prepare you not only\nfor your future careers but also for life. So, if you, a Ph.D. student, and reading this, do\nnot be discouraged. Take the train and enjoy the ride. `Allez bon courage !'\nI would like to start expressing my great gratitude to my thesis supervisor, Christophe\nMartin, for all the patience and guidance throughout this period. Thank you for all the\nscienti\u001cc discussions, teaching, and precious advises. We have succeeded in going through\na lot of di\u001eculties during this project also thanks to your feedback and ideas. Not only the\nfact that Christophe is an amazing thesis director, but he is also a very humble person.\nAll the Ph.D. students should have the chance to have a Christophe as their mentor.\n`Grand grand merci !'\nThanks to the jury (Gérard Vignoles, Mohamed Guessasma, Patrick Pizette, and\nClaire Silvani) for promptly having accepted to be part of the jury even if the time was\nnot the greatest (Christmas and New Year's holidays). All the discussions and very\ninteresting feedback I had during the defense were highly appreciated. Thank you.\nI would also like to thank the Vesuvius team for all the support. Severine RomeroBaivier thank you for having opened this job opportunity and proposing me this exciting\nand challenging project and to have introduced me to the very exciting world of refractories. Stephane Mazerat, who has accepted to embark on this project from the beginning,\nfor all the scienti\u001cc discussions, teaching, and good advices. The modeling team, Sebastien\nGregoire and Yuan Chen for all your help with the \u001cnite element simulations and your\npatience in explaining the tools in Abaqus even when you were very busy. My big thanks\ngoes also to the technicians, José Machado and Sebastien Henon, who have accepted to\nhelp me with my endless amount of experiments and still, having had all the patience\nin the world. I surely had a lot of fun at the lab with you both. José, I am so grateful\nfor all your help! In the beginning, it was a bit di\u001ecult mostly because of paperwork\nand language barriers. The trips to the French administration were much smoother and\nless scary with you there. Also, it was very nice to have someone to speak Portuguese\nsometimes. Muito obrigada!!! Stefano Martelli, thank you so much for having accepted\npromptly reviewing my entire thesis manuscript. Also, for all scienti\u001cc/life discussions,\nand guidance in some di\u001ecult moments. I will never forget all your help. I hope you will\nix\n\nhave a great retirement and be able to enjoy yourself and your family. Achraf Kallel, who\nwas the pioneer in performing DEM simulations at Vesuvius, thank you for having taken\nthe time to explain to me the simulations you performed and for having given the context\nof your previous work. Even if we followed very di\u001berent paths in the modeling, it helped\nme in organizing my ideas and thinking about which direction I should follow when at the\nvery beginning. Thy-Thuy-My, thank you for having spent a lot of your time at the end\nof my Ph.D. performing and improving the \u001cnal compaction FEM simulation. Because\nof you, I could have a nice closure. Your help was highly appreciated. Thanks also to\nthe VISO team for all the nice dialogues around the co\u001bee table, laughs, and scienti\u001cc\ndiscussions.\nBetween 2018 and 2019, for approximately 9 months, I had the opportunity to work\nat the SIMaP GPM2 group at the University of Grenoble and spend very nice moments\nwith the Ph.D. students, post-docs, and sta\u001b. The times at the bars after a hard working\nday and hiking in the amazing grenobloise mountains will not be forgotten. I would like\nto especially thank Kaoutar Radi and Shrey Joshi for all the co\u001bee breaks to release all\nthe stress during the Ph.D. and for the many funny moments. Kaoutar, thank you very\nmuch for have helped me with the dp3D. Your help was extremely important, mostly\nat the beginning, when I was a bit lost in using the code. Thank you also for all the\nencouragement. My thanks go also to Pauline Gravier for have given me good instructions\non how post-treating the X-ray tomography images on ImageJ. For Brayan Paredes, who\nhelped in organizing my `cadeaux de thèse' by distance. Unfortunately, I did not have\nmuch chance to spend time at Grenoble during your Ph.D., but I wish you the best of\nluck in your \u001cnal path. I am sure you will have a great defense! Coming to Grenoble\nalso allowed me to strengthen a very valuable friendship with my dearest Brazilian friend,\nqueen of magnetism, and Dr., Isabelle de Moraes. Thank you for having listened to me\nin very tough moments, for all the counseling, and for sharing such nice moments.\nWay before this long Ph.D. journey starts in the land of croissants and amazing fromage, I studied for a couple of years at an university in Rio de Janeiro with so many\ntalented and smart students who shared the same dreams as me. This group includes\nmy (almost Italian) friend Rosemere Lima, with whom shared many ambitious plans for\nafter my master's degree. Now, here we are! I am sure you'll do great at your Ph.D.\ndefense! I also had great mentors during my bachelor's and master's studies who may\nnot be forgotten. Mariana Banea and Hector Costa, my passion for materials science and\ndesire of working with research de\u001cnitely started when working with you both. Thank\nyou for have been this great motivation in my scienti\u001cc career.\nBeing here, writing my acknowledgments, after a successful Ph.D. defense would not\nbe possible without having my best friend (who also happens to be my future husband)\nbeside me. François Paquay, thank you so much for being with me in all the stressful\nmoments and for having given me all the support for me to succeed. For never letting me\nfall, holding my hands in the most di\u001ecult periods, bringing me co\u001bee and encouragement\nduring the thesis writing breaks, and celebrating all amazing moments. Also, because of\nyou, I could have met your incredible family (Janine, Guillaume, and Christian) that gave\nme so much support all along this journey. Thanks to all I have greatly improved my\nFrench (with a bit of the unique Belgian accent) and ampli\u001ced my passion for Belgian\nwa\u001fes. Coming to France and having met you and your family was one of the most\nwonderful surprises of my life.\nx\n\nThanks to my very big, noisy, crazy, and lovely Brazilian family who have supported\nand given me so much love all my life. To my beloved and caring friend and brother,\nGustavo Bonaldo, with my endless list of nicknames (fo\u001cnho, Gugu, Gu, Guguzinho,. . . ),\nwho patiently always listened to me (even when I was speaking too much, as always).\nFinally, but not less important, I want to thank the most amazing and caring woman\nof my life, my mother, Márcia Bonaldo. Thank you for having shown me and Gu that\nwith hard work and study we could reach anything we want in our lives. For always have\nsupported and believed in myself even when I did not. I don't remember of any moment\nthat you were not present (even now with more than 9 thousand kilometers far away).\nYou are and will always be a great inspiration in my life as a mother, woman, and person.\n\nxi\n\nTable of Contents\n1 Introduction\n\n1.1 Contexte et objectifs : modélisation des composites à base de poudre réfractaire . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Contexte et objectifs : modélisation des composites à base de poudre réfractaire\n\n1.1 Contexte et objectifs : modélisation des composites\nà base de poudre réfractaire\nVESUVIUS est un leader mondial dans le domaine de l'ingénierie et de la technologie de\nl'écoulement du métal en fusion, servant principalement les industries de l'acier et de la\nfonderie dans le monde entier. Le groupe est organisé en trois divisions (Advanced Refractories, Foundry Technologies, et Flow Control). La dernière division (Flow Control) est\nprincipalement associée au processus de coulée continue (Fig. 1.1 a), y compris la fabrication de produits réfractaires. Les pièces réfractaires produites sont surtout élaborées par\nmétallurgie des poudres. Selon l'application, les poudres réfractaires peuvent être compactées de manière uniaxiale ou isostatique, conduisant ainsi à des produits réfractaires\npour di\u001bérentes applications (Fig. 1.1 b). Le comprimé à vert obtenu (après compactage)\nest durci à 200°C et cuit (à 900°C). Pendant les cycles de coulée, une face de la pièce réfractaire est en contact avec l'acier fondu à 2000°C et l'autre face est en contact avec l'air (à\ntempérature ambiante). Ces conditions conduisent le matériau à un choc thermique, ce\nqui entraîne des \u001cssures et des dommages. De plus, les pièces réfractaires fonctionnent\ndans un environnement très agressif (oxydation, corrosion).\nLa modélisation du comportement des matériaux est l'un des outils permettant d'étudier\nles phénomènes de défaillance et d'améliorer la conception des produits. L'équipe de modélisation de VESUVIUS, supervisée par Severine-Romero Baivier, utilise la méthode des\néléments \u001cnis (FEM) pour modéliser le processus de coulée a\u001cn d'étudier le comportement\nthermo-mécanique des pièces réfractaires industrielles cuites, pendant la coulée, complémentée par un protocole expérimental. L'une des données d'entrée les plus critiques pour\nces simulations FEM est l'équation constitutive de la poudre. Le programme expérimental\nnécessaire pour identi\u001cer les équations constitutives d'une poudre donnée est complexe et\nprend du temps. Il doit être répété pour chaque composite de poudre.\nDeux doctorants de VESUVIUS ont déjà étudié expérimentalement le comportement\nde ces composites. Diane Dupuy (2013-2015) [Dupuy, 2015] et Andrzej Warchal (20152018) [Warchal, 2018] ont étudié les propriétés thermomécaniques de composites réfractaires modèles cuits par VESUVIUS. Ces composites modèles ont une composition simpli\u001cée par rapport aux autres réfractaires industriels, ce qui facilite la compréhension\nde la relation microstructure et les propriétés mécaniques. Dupuy a étudié l'impact de\nla composition de composites liés à l'alumine et au carbone (avec des variations sur les\nratios alumine/carbone et les dimensions des gros grains d'alumine) sur les propriétés\nthermomécaniques résultantes. Warchal a poursuivi les recherches de Diane mais s'est\nconcentré sur l'e\u001bet des antioxydants et des di\u001bérents paramètres de cuisson sur les propriétés thermomécaniques des composites cuits.\n3\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n\nFigure 1.1: a) Exemples d'opérations de coulée continue. b) Exemple de produits réfractaires VESUVIUS utilisés pour la coulée continue.\n\nCependant, les propriétés mécaniques du produit \u001cnal cuit ne dépendent pas uniquement du processus de cuisson et de la composition. Pendant le compactage, les pièces\nréfractaires peuvent entraîner un gradient de densité (certaines régions sont sur-compactées,\net d'autres sont sous-compactées). Cette distribution de densité peut conduire à des fortes\nvariations locales des propriétés thermo-mécaniques et, par conséquent, à des concentrations de contraintes et à la rupture potentielle pendant les opérations de coulée. Ainsi, des\ninformations telles que les distributions de densité et de contrainte dans le compact vert\npeuvent être utiles pour détecter les défauts pendant le compactage et après la cuisson.\nDans ce but, VESUVIUS et le laboratoire SIMaP ont proposé un doctorat en collaboration pour étudier le lien entre la microstructure, la compaction et les propriétés\nmécaniques des composites à vert et post-cuits. Le travail de ce doctorat comprend des\nanalyses microstructurales, des expériences et des simulations numériques utilisant deux\napproches : la méthode des éléments discrets (DEM) et la méthode des éléments \u001cnis\n(FEM), la majeure partie étant liée à la DEM.\nAchraf Kallel a introduit l'utilisation de la DEM, à VESUVIUS (2016-2017), pour\n4\n\n1.1. Contexte et objectifs : modélisation des composites à base de poudre réfractaire\n\nmodéliser la compaction et le comportement mécanique des réfractaires en alumine liée\nau carbone. Kallel a réalisé des simulations par DEM et FEM, ainsi que des essais expérimentaux. L'intérêt pour VESUVIUS de commencer à utiliser la DEM était principalement\ndue à sa possibilité de représenter la nature particulaire du composite en poudre, contrairement à la FEM qui considère la poudre comme un milieu continu. Le modèle utilisé\npar Kallel est assez di\u001bérent de celui utilisé dans ce travail de doctorat (chapitre 4) et a\nbeaucoup changé depuis le travail de Kallel. Cependant, la philosophie du modèle reste la\nmême, c'est-à-dire qu'il considère un ensemble de particules sphériques qui interagissent\nentre elles par des forces de contact et sont régies par la conservation de la quantité de\nmouvement (chapitre 2). Plus important encore, Kallel a démontré la pertinence et la\nfaisabilité de cette approche pour modéliser les composites de poudre VESUVIUS.\nSur la base de ce contextes général, trois axes sont développés dans ce travail de\ndoctorat :\n Une caractérisation expérimentale est développée sur les composites à base de\n\npoudre réfractaire (analyse par tomographie aux rayons X, compactage, et essais\nmécaniques sur des échantillons verts et après cuisson). Leur comportement de densi\u001ccation pendant la compaction, leurs propriétés mécaniques/thermomécaniques et\nleur microstructure sont identi\u001cés.\n Une étude approfondie des interactions au contact des particules entre les di\u001bérents\n\ncomposants (alumine grossière/\u001cnes, graphite et liant) pendant le compactage à\nl'aide de simulations DEM est réalisée. Le comportement mécanique macroscopique\nrésultant est comparé et calibré avec des données expérimentales (propriétés à vert\net après cuisson).\n Une méthodologie est proposée pour générer des surfaces de plasticité et de rup-\n\nture en e\u001bectuant des simulations numériques DEM complexes sur des échantillons\nnumériques verts. Ces surfaces sont utilisées pour ajuster le modèle élastoplastique Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC), et les paramètres du modèle sont calculés pour\nalimenter un code d'éléments \u001cnis a\u001cn de simuler le compactage de pièces industrielles.\nL'un des avantages des simulations numériques est la possibilité d'étudier l'amélioration\nde la forme proche de la forme nette (procédé de fabrication en continu de formes très\nproches de la forme \u001cnale et le développement de nouvelles géométries pour améliorer les\nprocédés industriels. Un autre avantage est la réduction du nombre d'expériences nécessaires pour chaque caractérisation de poudre. Ces deux actions peuvent avoir un impact\ndirect sur la réduction de la consommation de matières premières et par conséquent sur\n5\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\nune baisse de la surface des usines et des émissions de gaz à e\u001bet de serre (CO2 ). En\nmoyenne, pour 2018, 1,85 tonne de CO2 a été émise pour chaque tonne d'acier produite.\nL'industrie sidérurgique génère entre 7 et 9% des émissions directes liées à l'utilisation\nmondiale de combustibles fossiles [Association, 2013b]. VESUVIUS s'est \u001cxé comme objectif global en 2020 d'atteindre une empreinte carbone nette nulle au plus tard en 2050.\nL'une des actions du groupe consiste à réduire les déchets en récupérant davantage de\nproduits après leur utilisation et en augmentant l'utilisation de matériaux recyclés.\n\nFigure 1.2: Représentation du contexte autour de ce travail de thèse. Utilisation de la\nmodélisation des matériaux en poudre réfractaire et motivations.\n\n1.2 Organisation du projet industriel\nLes composites réfractaires liés au carbone ont une microstructure très hétérogène. Le\nprotocole expérimental nécessaire pour caractériser leurs propriétés mécaniques est com6\n\n1.2. Organisation du projet industriel\n\nplexe, principalement au stade de la compaction. Ainsi, la modélisation par la méthode\ndes éléments discrets (DEM) peut être un outil utile et complémentaire pour aider à comprendre leur comportement et leurs propriétés de compaction puisqu'elle prend en compte\nla nature particulaire de la poudre. De plus, les simulations DEM créent un lien avec la\nméthode des éléments \u001cnis (FEM) en générant des équations constitutives pour modéliser\nla pièce industrielle réfractaire.\nEn tant que partie principale du projet, les simulations DEM sont destinées à répondre à certaines questions fondamentales sur la modélisation d'un composite composé de\ndi\u001bérents éléments (alumine, graphite et liant) en termes de compactage et de propriétés\nmécaniques des échantillons verts/après cuisson. La première question à laquelle il faut\nrépondre est comment modéliser l'interaction entre ces di\u001bérents composants à l'échelle\ndu contact entre particules et comment ces interactions vont a\u001becter le comportement\nmacroscopique du composite ? De même, comment modéliser les interactions entre des\nparticules dures (alumine et graphite) avec un composant très mou (liant) ? Comment\nreprésenter en DEM di\u001bérentes compositions liant la fraction volumique de chaque composant ? Comment ces compositions vont-elles représenter le comportement réel (expériences) de la compaction ? L'expérience de VESUVIUS montre que la teneur en liant a un\nimpact important sur le comportement macroscopique. Ceci est-il con\u001crmé et reproduit\npar les simulations DEM ? Si oui, les simulations DEM peuvent-elles nous aider à comprendre les mécanismes sous-jacents ? Comment distinguer le comportement mécanique\npendant le compactage d'un échantillon cuit numériquement ? Quelle méthodologie sera\nappliquée pour générer des surfaces de rendement et de fracture à partir d'échantillons\ncompactés numériquement soumis à des tests mécaniques ? Comment faire le lien entre\nces surfaces générées à partir de DEM et alimenter un code FEM pour simuler le comportement de compactage d'une pièce industrielle ? Plus généralement, quel degré de\ncomplexité faut-il apporter au modèle de DEM pour représenter au mieux la microstructure réelle des composites industrielles tout en gardant un modèle su\u001esamment simple\npour être utilisé industriellement ? Pour répondre à ces questions, le travail e\u001bectué au\ncours de ce doctorat sera présenté sous la forme de six chapitres.\nLe chapitre 2 présente une revue de la littérature. Elle résume les principaux travaux\nsur la compaction et les propriétés mécaniques et thermomécaniques des matériaux céramiques\net réfractaires en termes de caractérisation expérimentale et surtout de modélisation utilisant les approches DEM et FEM.\nDans le chapitre 3, la méthodologie expérimentale et les résultats sont décrits. Tout\nd'abord, la microstructure d'un composite lié au carbone est présentée à partir d'une analyse par MEB et tomographie à rayons X. Le comportement de compactage, les propriétés\nmécaniques et thermomécaniques des échantillons verts et après cuisson sont également\n7\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\nprésentés.\n\nDans le chapitre 4, une approche originale basée sur la méthode des éléments discrets\n(DEM) est présentée pour représenter les composites réfractaires d'alumine liés au carbone pendant la compaction et leurs propriétés mécaniques après compaction et après\ncuisson. Les microstructures des composites sont représentées par un élément de volume\nreprésentatif (RVE). Les lois au contact des particules sont décrites pour modéliser les\ninteractions entre les composants élastiques et plastiques (alumine, graphite et liant).\n\nDans le chapitre 5, des simulations de compactage et d'essais mécaniques sur des\ncomposites numériques compactés ont été réalisées, en utilisant les lois de contact décrites\ndans le chapitre 3, et comparées aux données expérimentales. L'e\u001bet des propriétés du\nliant sur le comportement de compactage de la composition et l'hystérésis pendant la\ndécharge sont présentés. Des surfaces de iso-densité et de fracture sont générées à partir\nde simulations triaxiales et de traction, fournissant des informations précieuses sur le\ncomportement des composites à vert pour des états de contrainte qui sont di\u001eciles à\natteindre par des expériences.\n\nDans le chapitre 6, le comportement mécanique du composite virtuel cuit est étudié\nen e\u001bectuant des simulations triaxiales et de traction en DEM. Les simulations sont comparées aux données expérimentales. La propagation des \u001cssures pendant une simulation\nde traction est étudiée et corrélée avec les défauts qui ont été insérés numériquement\npour décrire les phénomènes liés au chau\u001bage/refroidissement du liant. Les surfaces de\nplasticité et de rupture sont générées à partir de simulations triaxiales et de traction et\nsont comparées aux expériences.\n\nEn\u001cn, dans le chapitre 7, le modèle Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC) est ajusté avec les\nsurfaces de rendement et de rupture DEM. Les paramètres du modèle DPC sont calculés.\nUne première tentative de modélisation du composite dans une simulation en matrice\nà l'aide du modèle DPC via un code d'éléments \u001cnis est présentée. Les résultats sont\ncomparés aux données DEM et expérimentales.\n8\n\n1.3. Schéma graphique\n\n1.3 Schéma graphique\n\nChapitre 2.

Introduction\n\n2.1 Introduction\nRefractory composite materials for steel casting applications are subjected to harsh working environments (thermal shock, oxidation, corrosion). These conditions promote cracking and material damage. In addition, as detailed in this chapter, refractory parts are\nprocessed by powder compaction that may lead to density gradient along the part geometry resulting in thermo-mechanical properties mismatch. These mechanical property\ndi\u001berences may induce stress concentration and failure of the industrial part. The quality\nof the refractory part and its ability to sustain steel casting conditions depend mainly on its\nnal microstructure. Understanding the link between the microstructure, the processing\nstages (compaction, \u001cring), and their \u001cnal thermo-mechanical properties are important\nfor developing new products and improving the industrial process.\nThe compaction of metallic, ceramic, or composite powders has been investigated in\nthe literature both experimentally and numerically. From a numerical point of view, the\ncompaction stage has been studied mainly by the Finite Element Method (FEM) that\ntreats the powder as a continuum and uses appropriate constitutive equations to describe\nthe compaction behavior of the material. The material parameters in these equations\nneed to be identi\u001ced by complex experiments.\nAnother method to model the compaction stage is the Discrete Element Method\n(DEM), which explicitly considers the powder as a collection of discrete particles. The\nDEM may be used e\u001bectively to clarify the link between the particulate microstructure\nand the behavior of the powder during compaction or to model the \u001cnal mechanical\nproperties of the compacted parts. DEM may also be applied to generate constitutive\nequations to feed a FEM code. These constitutive equations may be generated by conducting numerical DEM simulations under various complex stress state conditions.\nIn summary, this chapter \u001crst describes the steel-making process (steel casting, refractories used in the casting process). Second, a brief overview of refractory ceramic materials\n(microstructure, manufacturing stages) is presented. Afterward, the main aspects of the\ncompaction behavior of ceramic powders are discussed. The mechanical properties of\nrefractory powders as a function of temperature are detailed. Also, the use of FEM for\nthese materials is described; in particular, two constitutive equations (Drucker-Prager cap\nand Biggoni-Piccolroaz models) are presented. The main aspects of DEM are introduced,\nincluding the successive steps that a DEM simulation undertakes. Finally, some examples\nfrom the literature are using two di\u001berent numerical approaches: the \u001cnite element and\ndiscrete element methods.\n15\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n\n2.2 Steel-making process\nSteel is used for numerous applications: automobile, civil engineering, refrigeration systems, home appliances, cargo shipping, aeronautic industry [Association, 2013]. The world\nsteel production follows a characteristic steady linear growth in the last 70 years (Fig.\n2.1). In twenty years (from 2000 to 2020), steel production increased approximately by\n120%. Steel may essentially be produced following two routes: blast furnace-basic oxygen\nfurnace (BF-BOF) or electric arc furnace (EAF), see Fig. 2.2.\nA total of 70% of steel is produced using the BF-BOF route. The main di\u001berence\nbetween these two routes (EAF and BF-BOF) is that iron ore, coal, and recycled steel\nare used in the BF-BOF route, while in the EAF, the steel is produced using mostly\nrecycled steel and electricity [Association, 2013a]. In the BF-BOF route, iron ore pellets\nare introduced into a blast furnace (BF) with coke and limestone pellets to produce pig\niron [Ghosh, 2008].\nThe pig iron is converted to steel in the blast oxygen furnace (BOF) and transferred\ninto the ladle (secondary re\u001cning) for further deoxidation, desulfurization, vacuum degassing, and chemistry adjustment [Fruehan, 1998]. In the electric arc furnace (EAF)\nroute, electricity is used to melt recycled steel. Additives, such as alloys, are introduced\nto adjust to the desired chemical composition [Association, 2013a]. In both routes, the\nmolten metal is solidi\u001ced in the continuous casting process.\n\nFigure 2.1: World crude steel production from 1950 to 2020 (million tonnes) [Association,\n2013a]\nAt the end of the blast furnace or electric arc furnace (EAF or BOF) process, the\nliquid steel from the ladle is transferred to the continuous casting machine. Continuous\ncasting is the link between steel-making and rolling. This method was \u001crst suggested\nby Henry Bessemer in 1856. Still, it is only during the 1930s and 1940s that continuous\ncasting has become a common production method for nonferrous metals and later from\n16\n\n2.2. Steel-making process\n\nFigure 2.2: Overview of the steelmaking process [Association, 2013a]\n\nthe 1960s for steels [Seppo Louhenkilpi, 2014].\nDuring the casting operation, the steel \u001dows at a controlled rate from the ladle to the\ntundish inside a shroud (Fig. 2.2 b) located at the bottom of the ladle. The tundish\nis a metallurgical reactor vessel that improves control of steel cleanness, temperature,\nand composition. Ideally, the steel in the tundish should be free of any inclusions, and\nit should reach the best conditions for casting: optimal temperature, composition, and\ndynamic behavior.\nThe steel \u001dows from the tundish through a submerged entry nozzle (SEN) into a\nwater-cooled copper mold [Seppo Louhenkilpi, 2014]. In the mold, heat transfers cause\nimmediate solidi\u001ccation (cooling-down) of the liquid steel in contact with copper plates,\nresulting in a solid shell. When this solid shell is su\u001ecient to avoid any liquid steel spillage,\nthe strand is cut o\u001b and transferred to a rolling mill (Fig. 2.3 a).\nRefractory materials, such as stopper-controlled nozzles and slide gates, are used to\ncontrol the steel \u001dow from the ladle to the tundish and from the tundish to the mold (Fig.\n2.3 b). The ladle shroud (1) situated between the ladle and tundish also protects the\nliquid steel from oxidation. The monobloc stopper (2) ensures perfect steel \u001dow control\nfrom the tundish through a submerged entry nozzle (SEN). The SEN (3) distributes\nliquid steel into the mold to achieve the best solidi\u001ccation pattern and direct eventual\ninclusions towards the mold [Warchal, 2018]. In VESUVIUS, these refractory pieces are\nmanufactured out of carbon bonded alumina refractory composites (Al2 O3 -C), sometimes\n17\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\ncontaining metallic additives, such as MgO-C and ZrO2 -C (Fig. 2.3 c). An overview of\ncarbon-bonded refractory microstructure and processing stages are presented in the next\nsection 2.3.\n\nFigure 2.3: a) A schematic representation of the steel casting process (from ladle to\nmold). Figure adapted from VESUVIUS website. b) and c) Refractories used in steel\ncontinuous casting. Figures are adapted from [Routschka & Muthnow, 2012].\n\n2.3 Refractory ceramic materials\nRefractory materials are materials which resist high temperatures. They are mostly used\nin the steel industry, which by itself represents two-thirds of the applications of these\nmaterials [Katsavou et al., 2011]. According to [Routschka & Muthnow, 2012], the refractories are based on 6 di\u001berent oxides: SiO2 , Al2 O3 , MgO, CaO, Cr2 O3 , and ZrO2 (Fig.\n2.4), as well as carbon, or a combination of these [Ewais, 2004].\nA list of common refractory materials and their applications, with the carbon-containing\nrefractory materials, are presented in [Thethwayo & Steenkamp, 2020]. The carbon\nbonded refractories, for example, are applied to steel casting applications and are present\nin submerged nozzles, ladle shrouds, monobloc stoppers, and slide gate valves at VESUVIUS. Because of that, this type of refractories is our main interest, and when possible,\nwe will present some of the related studies described in the literature. More speci\u001ccally,\nthe refractory material studied is a carbon-bonded alumina (Al2 O3 -C) without any addi18\n\n2.3. Refractory ceramic materials\n\ntives, prepared speci\u001ccally for this PhD work (chapter 3). Although a model refractory,\nit represents quite well the typical refractory produced by VESUVIUS.\n\nFigure 2.4: A base material pyramid with the location of the refractory materials\n[Routschka & Muthnow, 2012].\nThe major components of carbon-bonded refractories are the aggregate, the matrix,\nand the pores. They are mainly composed of coarse refractory oxide grains and graphite\nakes. These particles are embedded in a matrix of pyrolytic carbon (binder), \u001cne refractory oxide grains, and sometimes additives. Fig. 2.5 a) shows a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a carbon bonded alumina refractory containing coarse alumina\noxide grains, a matrix (mixture of \u001cne alumina oxide grains and binder), and graphite\nakes. Fig. 2.5 b) represents the same microstructure, but with the addition of Al-Si additives as antioxidants. The white and grey spots in the coarse alumina grain correspond\nto impurities (TiO2 and SiO2 ) [Warchal, 2018].\nCarbon-bonded composite refractory parts for continuous steel casting are manufactured from pulverized raw materials (Fig. 2.6). The \u001crst step is mix-manufacturing, where\nraw materials (refractory oxides, graphite, phenolic resin, and additives) are weighted according to the selected material composition. They are inserted in a mixer where a furfural\nsolvent is added, forming aggregates that are a few tens of millimeters. In the VESUVIUS concept, the binder is formed by the mixture between phenolic resin, catalyzer, and\nfurfural solvent. Mixing temperature (usually between 50 and 65°C), duration, and \u001cnal\nmoisture content are adjusted to obtain the desired mixture consistency [Gardziella et al.,\n2000]. The obtained aggregates are afterward cooled down to room temperature.\nThese powder pellets are then shaped via two routes: isostatic or closed-die compaction, depending on the application (targeted \u001cnal product shape). The component\nafter compaction is denominated as the green body. The green bodies are heated up to\n19\n\nCHAPTER 2.

The curing provides\nthe material with su\u001ecient strength for handling and prepares the binder for \u001cring. Afterwards, the cured sample is \u001cred (\u001cring process). In the \u001cring, the cured sample is\nheated up to between 800 and 1000°C. During the \u001cring, the powder sample is submitted\nto microstructural changes (section 2.1).\nTo ensure excellence and consistency in the \u001cnal product, process and quality control\nprocedures are needed throughout the various processing stages (from compaction to \u001cring). The properties of the \u001cnal products are a\u001bected by all the processes involved in\nthe ring process. For example, some factors such as the \u001cring temperature or dwell time\nmust be carefully controlled during the heat treatment because they in\u001duence the physical and mechanical properties of the red parts (after curing, in contrast to green parts)\n[Braulio et al., 2008]. Indeed, some of the problems in the \u001cred parts (including incorrect\ndensity, size or shape, density gradient, and craking) originate from the compaction stage\n[Ramírez-Aragón et al., 2020]. Thus, understanding densi\u001ccation behavior (during compaction) and thermo-mechanical properties during \u001cring are essential for developing new\nceramic/refractory materials and improving near-net-shape ability.\n\n20\n\n2.4. Compaction behavior of ceramic powders\n\nFigure 2.6: Schematic representation of refractory manufacturing. Raw materials are\ncompacted following two routes (closed-die or isostatic con\u001cgurations) depending on the\nnal application (e.g., slide gate or ladle shroud products). The compacted pieces are\nthen \u001cred.\n\n2.4 Compaction behavior of ceramic powders\nCompaction of ceramic powders is a forming technique in which a ceramic powder is\nmade cohesive through mechanical densi\u001ccation. The compaction process allows parts to\nbe produced industrially to close tolerances. A closed-die pressing operation has typically\nthree steps (Fig. 2.7): a) the powder is inserted in a rigid die, b) the upper punch\nmoves inwards, applying pressure, and the powder is uniaxially compacted up to a speci\u001cc\nrelative density, c) unloading the compact and ejecting the compact from the die.\nDuring compaction, the stress needed to densify the powder increases further. It can\nbe described generally by a simple equation relating the compaction pressure P to the\nrelative density D:\nln(P ) = AD + B\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere A and B are empirical constants [Niesz, 1996].\n21\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n\nFigure 2.7: Schematic representation of the closed-die compaction experiment. a) The\ncomposite powder is inserted in a rigid steel die. b) The upper punch moves inwards and\nthe powder is compacted. c) Unloading (the compact is ejected from the die).\n\nThe powder compaction response can be described using more elaborated models\n(pressure density-dependent equations). The most applied models are the ones developed\nby Shapiro-Koltho and Konopicky (1947-1948) [Shapiro & Koltho\u001b, 1947] [Konopicky,\n1948], Balshin (1949) [Balshin, 1949], Heckel [R. W. Heckel, 1961] (1961), Cooper-Eaton\n(1962) [Cooper & Eaton, 1962], and Kawakita/Ludde [Kawakita & Lüdde, 1971], and\nPanelli-Ambrosio (2001) [Panelli & Ambrozio Filho, 2001].\nThese equations were proposed to investigate the e\u001bect of strain hardening on the\ncompaction of porous metals or metal powders. P. J Denny [Denny, 2002] described\nthe comparison between two powder compaction equations (Heckel and Kawakita). The\nauthor pointed out that in these models, it is assumed that the compact is isotropic. This\nis a strong assumption since, in closed-die compaction, the di\u001berence in stresses between\nthe axial and radial directions should produce anisotropy. Some of these equations have\nbeen applied or modi\u001ced for ceramic powders, for example, in [Ramakrishnan et al., 1997].\nRamakrishnan showed that the Heckel equation \u001ctted very nearly to the experimental data\n(closed-die compaction) when applied to magnesia, zirconia, and titania ceramics.\nIn [Moreno & Gonzalez-Oliver, 2011], closed-die compaction tests were carried out on\npure Al and Al-Cu matrix composites reinforced with short polycrystalline \u001cbres. Moreno\net al. compared experimental data with the Kawakita, Panelli-Ambrosio, and Konopicky\nequations. The authors observed a reasonably good \u001ctting between experimental data\nand the models. However, each model highlighted a di\u001berent limitation. For example, the\nKawawita equation has shown the best linear \u001ct with all experimental data. However, the\nparameter b (compressibility) was not in agreement with the hardening behavior of the\nmaterial (aluminum-based metal matrix composites). Panelli and Ambrosio's equations\ntted well qualitatively the data for all compaction tests, still only over a limited pressure\n22\n\n2.4. Compaction behavior of ceramic powders\n\nrange (>50MPa). Finally, the Konopick model allowed the best characterization of the\nhardening behavior of the aluminum powder material. More speci\u001ccally, the yield stresses\nobtained by Konopicky \u001cttings resulted in very good agreement with the yield stresses\nobtained by experiments.\nGeneral powder ceramic materials (e.g., alumina powders) follow a characteristic behavior during compaction. The compaction curve of these ceramic materials is controlled\nby three di\u001berent stages that show di\u001berent mechanisms. The \u001crst one (stage I) where the\ncompaction pressure increases and the RD remain almost the same (Fig. 2.8). This stage\nis controlled by intergranular particle friction and grains rearrangement, which does not\nresult in any signi\u001ccant powder compaction. Next, at stage II, the compaction begins to\nbe controlled by plastic deformation. The transition from stage I to stage II is marked by\na clear increase of the RD. Stage III is represented by fracture of powder aggregates [Niesz,\n1996] [Haussonne et al., 2005] or at very high stresses, fracture of the ceramic particles\nthemselves. In some cases, it might be di\u001ecult to identify this transition between stages\nII and III properly. The plastic deformation in stage II may come from the extrusion or\ndeformation of a viscous binder or the aggregate deformation during compaction.\n\nFigure 2.8: Densi\u001ccation curve of general ceramic powders and the di\u001berent stages of\ncompaction. The \u001cgure is reproduced from [Haussonne et al., 2005].\nFig. 2.9 shows typical closed-die compaction curves (axial stress versus relative den23\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\nsity) of spray-dried alumina powder (Al6SG) [Carneim & Messing, 2001] and a carbonbonded alumina composite (Al2 O3 -C) containing a mixture of coarse alumina aggregates\nand graphite \u001dakes embedded into a matrix composed of a mixture between \u001cne alumina\nparticles and binder. Fig. 2.9 a) shows a clear quantitative di\u001berence between the two\ncurves. In particular, the pure alumina powder is compacted only to relatively low relative\ndensity (less than 60%) and relatively large stresses (> 150 MPa). The powder composite\nexperiences much larger densi\u001ccation compared with the pure alumina powder.\n\nFigure 2.9: Typical curve from a closed-die compaction test (alumina ceramic powder\nand refractory composite): evolution of the axial stress against the relative density in a)\nlinear and b) logarithmic scales.\n\nHowever, when plotting the same curves in logarithmic scale (Fig. 2.9 b), the curves of\nboth powder materials show qualitatively similar behavior. The main di\u001berence is a shift\nin relative density (alumina powder starts with a much smaller density). The two \u001crst\nstages, I and II (Fig. 2.8), might be identi\u001ced. However, the transition between stages II\nand III might be di\u001ecult to be recognized in both curves. Still, the phenomena that explain the compaction behavior in the alumina powder in Carneim et al. and the refractory\ncomposite are di\u001berent. Carbon-bonded composites have a much more complex behavior\nthan alumina powder ceramics because of the viscous component (binder) added to the\nmixture. Usually, those composites have a much larger binder content (approximately\n22 wt.% in the example in Fig. 2.9), against 2.5-5.4 wt.% in Carneim et al. One of the\njusti\u001ccations for the density di\u001berence between both materials clearly originates from the\nbinder content.\nThe compaction behavior in carbon-bonded composites may be divided into two main\nstages. At the beginning, the grains are rearranged with the increase of pressure, and\nsimilar to alumina powder behavior in stage I, the composite relative density (RD) remains\nalmost the same. At this stage, the composite is very porous. However, while the pressure\n24\n\n2.4. Compaction behavior of ceramic powders\n\ncontinues to increase, the binder extrudes between aggregates and \u001clls the inter-grains\npores increasing the composite RD. The binder, which is viscous-plastic, is the component\nthat most dictates the densi\u001ccation behavior of the composite and is responsible for its\nplastic behavior.\nSome authors also studied the spring-back behavior of ceramic materials during the\nunloading (ejection of the sample from the rigid die). The spring back is the release of\nenergy stored in both the organic and inorganic components [Niesz, 1996]. So, this energy\nis accumulated during the compaction (loading) and released during the unloading. The\ncontributing factors to the storage of this energy will depend highly on the material\ncomposition. For example, compaction comes mostly from interlocking particles on 'dry\npowders' (no organic component). However, some ceramic materials contain a binder as\na bonding component. Because the binder has a visco-plastic behavior, it is a dominant\nfactor for the energy stored during the compaction and consequently spring-back.\nIn addition, the e\u001bect of the strain rate on the compaction behavior of carbon bonded\nalumina refractories was studied by [Kallel, 2017] (Fig. 2.10). The compaction tests were\ncarried out using di\u001berent but constant displacement rates (0.5, 5, and 25 mm/min).\nFig. 2.10 a) shows the evolution of the strain rate (s-1 ) with the sample relative density\n(%). The strain rate can be considered approximately constant along the compaction\ntests (Fig. 2.10 a). The compaction pressure (or axial stress) against the relative density\n(RD) curves for each punch velocity is shown in Fig. 2.10 b). The compaction with the\nhighest velocity (25mm/min) exhibits the sti\u001best behavior. More generally, these curves\nshow that the behavior is rate sensitive. This strain rate sensitivity is mainly due to the\npresence of the visco-plastic binder. The rate sensitivity is more pronounced for high\npunch displacement rates (that correspond to approximately 10-2 sec-1 strain-rate).\nThe e\u001bect of the binder/moisture content and the strain rate dependency on the\ncompaction behavior of agglomerated alumina powders was studied by Briscoe et al.\n[Briscoe & Özkan, 1997]. The authors observed that samples with an excess of binder\n(4.7 wt.%), 'wet' agglomerates reached a higher relative density at a given compaction\npressure when compared to the other samples containing less binder content (2.4 wt.%).\nSimilar to [Kallel, 2017], the compaction in Briscoe et al. showed a strain rate dependency.\nThe higher the speed rate (mm/s), the lower the resulting relative density. The strain-rate\ndependence of the compaction of samples with more binder content ('wet' agglomerates)\nis more pronounced than the samples with less binder ('dry' agglomerates). Indeed, in\n[Tanaka et al., 1994], increasing moisture (binder content) during closed-die compaction\nled to an increase in the relative density of alumina ceramic compacts. The opposite was\nfound in [Carneim & Messing, 2001]. Carneim et al. studied the e\u001bect of organic binder\ncontent and binder plasticity on the stress-strain response of alumina ceramic powders\n25\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n\nFigure 2.10: Closed-die compaction experiments carried out at di\u001berent strain rates (s-1 )\nand displacement rates of a Al2 O3 -C refractory composite with ≈ 20 wt.%: (a) evolution\nof the strain rate (s-1 ) with the relative density. (b) evolution of the relative density with\nthe compaction pressure.\n\nduring closed-die compaction tests. The authors observed that the mixture with more\nbinder reached a smaller relative density to a given compaction pressure when comparing\nthe other mixtures with less binder.\nThe e\u001bect of the strain rate on the compaction behavior of agglomerated alumina\npowders was also studied by Briscoe et al. for alumina powders with variation in the\nbinder content (between 2.4 and 4.7 wt.%). In accordance with the study proposed by\nKallel, the compaction behavior showed a strain-rate dependency. The higher the speed\nrate (mm/s), the lower the resulting relative density. Briscoe et al. showed that the\nstrain-rate dependence of the compaction of samples with more binder content (' wet'\nagglomerates) is more pronounced than for samples with less binder (' dry' agglomerates).\nThe authors observed that samples with an excess of binder (wt.%) reached a higher\nrelative density at a given compaction pressure as compared to samples containing less\nbinder. Similarly, Tanaka et al. [Tanaka et al., 1994] showed that increasing moisture\n(binder content) in alumina agglomerates during closed-die compaction led to an increase\nin the relative density of alumina ceramic compacts. In Tanaka et al., the moisture content\nwas rather small (0.3-2.7%).\nThe opposite was found in [Carneim & Messing, 2001]. Carneim et al. studied the\ne\u001bect of organic binder content and binder plasticity on the stress-density response of\nalumina ceramic powders during closed-die compaction tests. In their case, the binder\ncontent ranged from 2.5 to 5.4 wt.%. Carneim et al. have shown that it was possible to\nachieve slightly higher density at a given pressure with less binder. Still, the di\u001berences\nbetween the powder with less and more binder were very small (≈ 56-58% at the maximum\n26\n\n2.5. Thermo-mechanical behavior of carbon-bonded refractories\n\ncompaction pressure). Also, the powder sample with less binder started from a larger\ndensity (29%) compared with the one with more binder (25%).\nMost importantly, the general comparison of the compaction behavior and green properties of general ceramics, metallic-ceramic materials, and pharmaceutical powders with\ncarbon-bonded refractories should be taken cautiously. The alumina powder materials\nstudied by [Tanaka et al., 1994], [Briscoe & Özkan, 1997], and [Carneim & Messing, 2001]\nhave a very small binder content (0.3-5.4 wt.%) if compared with the carbon-bonded alumina composite refractory studied by [Kallel, 2017] and on materials similar to those that\nwill be studied in this Ph.D. (between 17 and 25 wt.%). Also, for example, in Carneim\net al., the binder Tg is between -32°C and +35°C, and in Kallel, approximately +60 and\n+70°C. Contrary to these alumina powder materials, the carbon-bonded refractory has a\nspeci\u001cc behavior at the compaction stage. These composite materials are generally composed of a carbonaceous matrix (mixture of \u001cne oxide grains and binder). Their plastic\nbehavior derives from grains rearrangement and binder visco-plasticity due to the binder,\nas seen previously.\nThe interest in carbon bonded alumina ceramic refractories (Al2 O3 -C) is motivated by\ntheir use as functional refractory products for \u001dow control continuous casting since they\nexhibit excellent thermal shock and slag resistance after \u001cring (heating process) [Chen\net al., 2021]. Although more than 4,000 scienti\u001cc papers were published in 2021 under\nthe topic' carbon bonded refractory', the main focus has been on investigating their\nmechanical properties as a function of temperature, not on their compaction behavior\nand green properties. However, many defects in the \u001cring can be traced to the green\nmicrostructure. A key problem is density variation within parts and among parts, since\nit a\u001bects both industrial part quality and the ability to keep tight dimensional tolerances\n[Niesz, 1996]. Also, density gradient leads to di\u001berent thermo-mechanical properties of\nthe \u001cred part. The compaction behavior of ceramic materials and their green properties\nafter compaction using a numerical approach will be discussed in sections 2.6 and 2.7.\n\n2.5 Thermo-mechanical behavior of carbon-bonded refractories\n2.5.1 Young's modulus\nThe thermo-mechanical properties of carbon-bonded refractories have been thoroughly\nstudied in the literature in the last decades. In particular, the evolution of their Young's\nmodulus with temperature is of clear interest as they are used over a large temperature\ndomain. To relate the microstructural changes of refractory composite materials as a\n27\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\nfunction of temperature, the nonlinear evolution of Young's modulus of carbon-bonded\nalumina refractories (Al2 O3 -C) was analyzed by [Gault et al., 1985], [Werner et al., 2013],\n[Warchal et al., 2017], [Luchini et al., 2018], and in the Ph.D. thesis of [Dupuy, 2015] and\n[Warchal, 2018].\nIn [Werner et al., 2013], the Young's modulus and the thermal expansion were measured in a temperature range from 25°C (RT) to 1450°C by the impulse excitation technique (IET) in \u001cred (between 700-1000°C) carbon-bonded alumina refractories. Based\non these two analyses, for a better understanding of the behavior of these properties\nevolution, the cycle here is divided into 3 stages and summarized (Fig. 2.11):\n\nFigure 2.11: E\u001bective Young's modulus (normalized) evolution versus temperature, during heating and cooling, for a carbon-bonded alumina composition [Werner et al., 2013].\n\nStage I (25-450°C): The Young's modulus is almost constant (8 GPa).\nStage II (400-1200°C): The Young's modulus increases signi\u001ccantly up to approximately 1000°C. This increase is related to microstructural changes. The binder is transformed into pyrolitic carbon, and the alumina, graphite, and binder components expand\ndi\u001berently due to their thermal expansions mismatch (alumina: ≈ 7-9 10-6 K-1 , graphite:\n25-42 10-6 K-1 , and binder: 3.2-6.9 10-6 K-1 ). The alumina and graphite have a higher CTE\nthan the binder. Thus, they expand more than the binder. The matrix is also expanded,\ncreating gaps between alumina aggregates and the matrix. Between 1000-1200°C, because\nof the matrix expansion, some open pores are closed or healed, leading to an approximately\nconstant Young's modulus (18 GPa).\nStage III (1200-1450°C): There is a slight decrease in Young's modulus (from 18 to\n28\n\n2.5. Thermo-mechanical behavior of carbon-bonded refractories\n\n17 GPa). This decrease is a consequence of microstructure cracks due to alumina expansion during the heating above the pyrolysis temperature. The Young's modulus slightly\nincreases at the holding time (at 1450°C) (from 17 to 19 GPa). The increase during the\nholding time is due to some bonding between alumina particles that sinter together. The\nauthor also observed lower sintering e\u001bects of the microstructure at 1450°C in microstructure with higher graphite and coarse alumina content (more graphite layers surrounding\nthe alumina, inhibiting the sintering and large alumina particles that do not sinter easily).\nThe cooling can also be divided into three stages (I-III). In stage III, the Young's\nmodulus remains almost constant. In stage II, there is a signi\u001ccant decrease of Young's\nmodulus due to the detachment of the aggregates from the surrounding matrix. Thus,\nassuming that the matrix is cohesive, decohesions occur at the interface alumina/matrix\nand graphite/matrix [Luchini et al., 2018]. The presence of acoustic activity in [Dupuy,\n2015; Warchal, 2018] during cooling con\u001crms this type of defect. In stage I (RT), the gap\nat the interface aggregates/matrix is larger than before due to the over-stressed matrix.\nThese observations from Young's modulus measurements in [Werner et al., 2013],\n[Dupuy, 2015] and [Warchal, 2018] may be complemented by recent experimental data\nand scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observations in [Luchini et al., 2018], in similar\ncomposites (Al2 O3 -C). Fig. 2.12 a) shows the SEM micrographs of the 3 analyzed samples\n(1-3). Fig. 2.12 a) (1) represents the refractory microstructure after curing (up to 180°C).\nFig. 2.12 a) (2) is related to the \u001crst heating cycle (up to 500°C). Fig. 2.12 a) (3), after\ntwo heating cycles (up to 1,000°C).\nThe SEM micrographs of these three thermal cycle conditions were analyzed after\ncooling. It can be observed a matrix microstructural change along with the thermal\ntreatment. The sample after curing (1) presents a matrix with very small and isolated\nmicro-cracks. In (2), the matrix exhibits a few medium-sized network cracks in the matrix.\nIn (3), there is an overall well-developed crack network. Those cracks are related to the\nrelease of volatiles and to the high anisotropy of graphite thermal expansion [Luchini\net al., 2018].\nLuchini et al. also documented the evolution of the alumina/matrix interface during\nthose thermal treatment cycles by SEM (Fig. 2.12 b). (1) represents the sample after\ncuring, (2) after one cycle of heating (up to 500°C), and (3) after two cycles up to 1,000°C.\nThe interface alumina/matrix after curing (1) is well-connected. However, the one (2) and\ntwo heating cycles (3) were highly a\u001bected by the thermal cycles. In (3), it is possible to\nsee a notable void between the alumina aggregate and the matrix. Typical graphite basal\nplane cracks are shown in Fig. 2.12 c) for a sample heated up to 1,000°C after two cycles.\n[Werner et al., 2014] also investigated Young's modulus (E ) of carbon-bonded refractories, not only as a function of the temperature but also as a function of porosity. The\n29\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n\nFigure 2.12: SEM micrographs of a carbon bonded alumina refractory. a) (1) cured at\n180°C; (2) one cycle heating up to 500°C; (3), 2 cycles up to 1000°C.

The\nsamples were uniaxially compacted at di\u001berent pressure (20, 40, 70, 100, and 130 MPa),\ncured (up to 180°C), and \u001cred (up to 1000°C). Considering the normalized Young's modulus, the results are qualitatively similar for all porosity levels (Fig. 2.13 a). In Fig. 2.13\nb), the Young's modulus decreases with increasing porosity, mainly at high temperatures\n(1200-1400°C).\n\n2.5.2 Compressive behavior\nAs seen above, the acoustic measurement of the Young's modulus (E ) of \u001cred carbonbonded refractories shows that E depends on the porosity (compaction pressure leading to\nsamples with di\u001berent porosity percentages) and testing temperature. Material properties\nare variable and depend not only on the original design but also on the microstructural and\nchemical changes produced by thermal conditions [Musante et al., 2012]. Many research\n30\n\n2.5.

Figures are adapted from [Werner et al., 2014].\n\narticles are focused on studying the mechanical properties of these refractories. It has\nbeen observed in the literature a broad range of mechanical properties values that mainly\ndepend on the refractory composition, the applied curing/\u001cring temperature, the testing\ntemperature, and the experimental methodology.\nBesides Young's modulus, some of the mechanical properties largely presented in the\nliterature include the cold modulus of rupture (CMOR), measured at room temperature,\nand the hot modulus of rupture (HMOR). [Fan et al., 2011], [Zhu et al., 2013], and [Yin\net al., 2019] performed 3-point bending tests on \u001cred Al2 O3 -C refractories with a silicon\n(Si) additive and measured the CMOR at RT, and HMOR at 1400°C ([Zhu et al., 2013],\nand [Yin et al., 2019]).\nIn [Werner et al., 2014], uniaxial compressive tests were carried out in carbon-bonded\nalumina refractories (without any additive). For this purpose, three compositions were\nproduced (T20, T29, and T20-3). According to their compositions, T20-3 and T20 have\nmore alumina aggregates. T29 has more graphite, and T20 has more porosity. The\ncomposite with more porosity (T20) has shown lower values of Young's modulus (E ), and\nthe one with more graphite (T29) has shown higher CMOR. A decrease of HMOR for\ntemperature above 1000°C could be observed in T20 and T29. This decrease is because,\nabove 1000°C, the microstructures (T20 and T29) were damaged by a further expansion\nof alumina and graphite, resulting in microcracking (E decreases). For T20-3, this theory\nseemed not suitable as E also decreases, but HMOR increases or stays equal. Therefore,\nthe recently created microcracks did not a\u001bect the strength.\n[Musante et al., 2012] studied the thermo-mechanical behavior of a set of \u001cred MgO-C\n31\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\nrefractories (A1, A2, and B compositions), containing small Al content (2-4 wt%). These\ncomposites were produced containing two di\u001berent carbon binders (A1 and A2) and resin\n(B), with di\u001berent content of MgO aggregates. Stress-strain curves were determined by\napplying uniaxial compression tests, carried out at room temperature (RT), 600, 1000,\nand 1400°C (Fig. 2.14). Regarding the stress-strain curves, composite B presented greater\nmechanical strength (and larger sti\u001bness) than composites A1 and A2. Also, composites\nA1 and A2 exhibited a more softening response. These behavior are determined by the\ntype of binder (resin vs. pitch binder) and the presence of silicon in composite B. At 600°C,\na softer response is observed in all composites with decreased mechanical properties (e.g.,\nE and strength). According to the authors ([Musante et al., 2012]), this was due to\norganic binder transformation at 600°C (the same was observed in [Uchida & Ichikawa,\n1998]).\nAnother study on \u001cred carbon-bonded refractories (Al2 O3 -C) applying two testing\ntemperature (RT and 1000°C) on uniaxial compression tests was described by [Musante\net al., 2011]. At RT, the softening in the composite with a lower graphite content was attributed to its high true porosity (pores and cracks), favoring the microcracking. Overall,\nthe sti\u001bness and the mechanical strength were higher as the testing temperature increased\n(1000°C).\nIn summary, the mechanical behavior of carbon-bonded refractories might be associated with: a) microcracking of pre-existent damage within the matrix and between\nmatrix/aggregates; b) sliding and crumbling of graphite \u001dakes; c) plastic deformation of\nthese \u001dakes; or d) binder plasticity [Musante et al., 2011].\n\n2.5.3 Tensile behavior\nStress versus (engineering) strain curves from uniaxial tensile tests performed on Al2 O3 -C\nare shown in Fig. 2.15 [Dupuy, 2015] [Warchal et al., 2017; Warchal, 2018]. It is possible\nto observe that their tensile behavior does not represent the typical mechanical behavior\nof general ceramics since carbon-bonded alumina composites exhibit a strong nonlinearity.\nThe investigated refractory is also able to develop an important strain before its rupture.\nThence, the shape of the curve resembles that of metals (with much lower strength). However, such behavior does not result from the movement of dislocations but the damaged\nmicrostructure (microcracks and decohesions) created during \u001cring. Moreover, after each\nloading/unloading cycle, the elastic modulus value decreases, suggesting that new defects\nare created within the material during mechanical loading. Thus, such behavior may be\nclassi\u001ced as pseudoplastic, and the damage is the one that dictates the overall refractory\nmechanical behavior [Warchal, 2018].\n32\n\n2.5.

For this purpose, Harmuth performed a wedge splitting test on\n33\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\nve di\u001berent compositions based on carbon-bonded refractories. Afterward, the author\nused a microscopic fractographic procedure to analyze the fracture surface after the destructive tests. The results have shown that less brittle refractories have a lower amount\nof trans-granular crack propagation, and higher percentage of crack propagation within\nthe grain/matrix interface. Both strength and speci\u001cc fracture energy for crack initiation\nincreased with the percentage of trans-granular crack propagation.\nAlso, [Chen et al., 2020] performed 3-point bending tests on Al2 O3 -C aggregates refractories reinforced by SiC whiskers (4 wt%). The paths of the propagating cracks in\ntwo samples after the tests are shown in Fig. 2.16 a). TRS and MRS have di\u001berent\ntypes of Al2 O3 -C aggregates. The speci\u001cc crack lengths, in percentage, of the three crack\npropagation mechanisms for the two samples are plotted in Fig. 2.16 b). The cracks\npropagated mostly along with the aggregate/matrix interface in sample TRS (>85%).\nOn the other hand, sample MRS exhibited a more stable fracturing behavior (≈ 48%\nwithin the matrix, ≈ 31% within aggregate/matrix interface, and ≈ 20% within the\naggregate) compared with TRS. Force-displacement curves from the 3-point bending tests\nfor TRS and MRS samples are shown in Fig. 2.16 c). MRS exhibited a stronger behavior\n(higher strength) and lower brittleness if compared with TRS. This stability in the fracture\nis generally associated with a lower brittleness [Dai et al., 2017] [Chen et al., 2020].\nIn summary, Chen et al. proved that raw materials (alumina, matrix, graphite) could\nin\u001duence the microcracking mechanisms. Chen et al. are in agreement with the theory\nproposed by Harmuth ([Harmuth, 2010]) which says that a larger amount of trans-granular\ncracks (within the aggregate) lead to a improvement of the material strength.\n\n34\n\n2.5.

Numerical modeling using the \u001cnite element method (FEM)\n\n2.6 Numerical modeling using the \u001cnite element method\n(FEM)\nContinuum mechanical modeling with the \u001cnite element method (FEM) has been largely\napplied to evaluate the compaction behavior of powder materials. Using FEM to model\ncompaction necessitates implementing a constitutive equation that is able to reproduce\nthe complex behavior of a powder. In particular, the phenomenological model needs to\nreproduce the powder behavior under both isostatic (pressure sensitive) and shear stress\ncomponents. In other words, the model needs to reproduce the fact that a powder densi\u001ces under pressure and may dilate or fracture if shear components are applied. Typically\nthe Drucker-Prager-Cap elastoplastic model can reproduce quite simply such a behavior.\nThe Drucker-Prager-Cap elastoplastic model has been applied for powder metallurgy [Almanstötter, 2015] [Zhou et al., 2017], ceramic materials [Aychn et al., 1996] [Abdullah\net al., 2009] [Buljak et al., 2021], and for the pharmaceutical industry [Michrafy et al.,\n2002] [Michrafy et al., 2004] [Kadiri et al., 2005] [Sinha et al., 2010] [Garner et al., 2015]\n[Perez-Gandarillas et al., 2018]. Another model is the Bigoni and Piccolroaz yield/damage\nfunction [Bigoni & Piccolroaz, 2004] [Piccolroaz et al., 2006] [Bosi et al., 2014] [Argani\net al., 2016] [Penasa et al., 2016]. Other constitutive models include the one developed by\n[Fleck, 1995] and the Cam-Clay model [Lade & Kim, 1988] (which is often used in rock\nmechanics).\n\n2.6.1 Drucker-Prager Cap model\nThe Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC) model is used to model the elastoplastic behavior of\npowders, assuming the material is porous compressible and isotropic. The model provides\nan inelastic hardening mechanism that accounts for plastic deformation during compaction\nand volume dilatancy when the powder yields in shear [Garner et al., 2015].\nThe DPC model is described by the powder yielding as a function of hydrostatic\npressure (p), the modulus of deviatoric stress (q ), or equivalent Von Mises stress, and the\nrelative density of the powder. The model is divided into two segments: a shear failure\nsurface (Fs ) which characterizes the limit of allowable stress that can lead to material\nfailure, and a cap surface (Fc ) that de\u001cnes the powder densi\u001ccation (hardening), see Fig.\n2.17. A transition surface may also be introduced to smoothen the transition between the\ntwo surfaces. Here, we will more speci\u001ccally describe the DPC implementation in Abaqus\n([Abaqus, 2006]) as this is the FEM model that will be used in this Ph.D.\nThe domain de\u001cned under these surfaces characterizes any stress state under which the\nmaterial can behave elastically. Therefore, for any stress that ultra-passes this domain,\n37\n\nCHAPTER 2.

The shear failure surface in the p − q plane is represented as a\nstraight line and is de\u001cned as:\nFs = q − p tan(β) − d = 0\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere β is the internal frictional angle, and d is the powder cohesion.\nThe hydrostatic pressure stress (p) and the modulus of deviatoric stress are de\u001cned\nas:\n1\np = − (σz + 2σr )\n3\n\n(2.3)\n\nq = |σz − σr |\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere σz and σr are the axial and radial stresses, respectively.\nThe cap surface hardens or softens as a function of the volumetric plastic strain: volumetric plastic compaction (when yielding on the cap) causes hardening, while volumetric\nplastic dilation (when yielding on the shear failure surface) causes softening [Han et al.,\n2008]. The cap yield surface (Fc ), that is represented by an ellipse, intersects the shear\nfailure surface (Fs ) at p = Pa , and the hydrostatic stress axis at p = Pb .\nThe cap yield surface is written as:\ns\nFc =\n\n38\n\n(p − pa )2 +\n\n\u0012\n\nRq\n1 + α − α/ cos β\n\n\u00132\n− R(d + pa tan β) = 0\n\n(2.5)\n\n2.6.

Pb is the hydrostatic yield stress. α is\na small number (typically 0.01\u00150.05) used to de\u001cne a smooth transition surface between\nthe shear failure surface and the cap.\nThe distance between Pb and Pa is:\nPb − Pa = R(d + Pa tan β)\n\n(2.6)\n\nWhen the material densi\u001ces, the yield surface expands and the evolution of the yield\nsurface is represented by the hardening law Pb as a function of the volumetric plastic\nstrain (εpl\nvol ):\nεpl\nvol = ln\n\n\u0012\n\nRD\nRD0\n\n\u0013\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere RD is the current relative density, and RD0 is the initial relative density on \u001clling\nof die.\nIn the transition region between the shear failure surface and the cap, a transition\nsurface (Ft ) is introduced:\ns\nFt =\n\n\u0012\n[(p − Pa )] + q − 1 −\n2\n\n\u0014\n\nα\ncos β\n\n\u0013\n\n\u00152\n(d + Pa tan β) − α (d + Pa tan β) = 0\n\n(2.8)\n\n2.6.2 Bigoni-Piccolroaz model\nA yield/damage function was proposed by Bigoni and Piccolroaz (BP) [Bigoni & Piccolroaz, 2004] for modeling the inelastic behavior of a broad class of pressure-sensitive,\nfrictional, ductile, and brittle-cohesive materials. The yield function represents a single,\nconvex and smooth surface in stress space approaching as limit situations well-known criteria and the extreme limits of convexity in the deviatoric plane (Fig. 2.18). The BigoniPiccolroaz (BP model) is seen as a generalization of the von Mises, Drucker\u0015Prager,\nTresca, modi\u001ced Tresca, Coulomb\u0015Mohr, modi\u001ced Cam-clay, Deshpande-Fleck (2000),\nRankine, and Ottosen models. The BP model allows the possibility of describing complex\nyield surfaces. In the BP model, one of the motivations was to have a single criterion\nrelating to di\u001berent types of materials.\nTo describe the hardening of the powder material during compaction, a suitably `deformable' surface is needed [Piccolroaz et al., 2006]. The yield function has 7 parameters\n39\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n\nFigure 2.18: Increase in cohesion as related to hardening [Piccolroaz et al., 2006].\n\nand is given as:\nF (σ, pc , c) = f (pc, pc , c) +\n\nq\ng(θ)\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere pc and c are the parameters that depend on plastic deformation and de\u001cne the\nhardening behavior. q is the deviatoric invariant. f (p) is the function describing the\ndependence on the hydrostatic pressure p.\ng(θ) describes the dependence on the Lode's invariant θ and is de\u001cned as:\ng(θ) =\n\n1\ncos [βπ/6 − (1/3) cos−1 (γ cos 3θ)]\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe yield function is explained in greater detail in [Bigoni & Piccolroaz, 2004]. Analyzing Figs. 2.17 and 2.18, it shows that the DPC model and the Bigoni-Piccolroaz\n(BP) models bear some clear resemblance. However, the BP model allows for a continuous transition between the di\u001berent behaviors but at the cost of a larger number of\nparameters.\n\n2.6.3 Compaction simulations of ceramic powders using the FEM\nThe compaction modeling of ceramic powder materials using a \u001cnite element method\nmay be a useful tool to control the shape and density distribution in the powder compact.\nThe interest by the industry and researchers on this topic has been growing in the last\nyears. The growing interest by the industry is because, during the pressing, the friction\n40\n\n2.6. Numerical modeling using the \u001cnite element method (FEM)\n\nbetween the powder and the die-wall can lead to non-uniform density distribution in the\ngreen part, consequently leading to material damage/crack during the \u001cring. Therefore,\nthe simulations can be useful for the improvement of the near-net shape. The FEM of\npowder compaction has been largely applied in the last years on metal [Almanstötter,\n2015] [Zhou et al., 2017], and pharmaceutical [Krok et al., 2014] [Garner et al., 2015]\npowders.\nNowadays, the Drucker-Prager Cap is the most known model to simulate the compaction of powder materials. FEM compaction simulations on ceramic materials have\nbeen been extensively described in the literature Aychn et al. [1996] [Park & Kim, 2001]\n[Zeuch et al., 2001] [Abdullah et al., 2009] [He et al., 2013] [Penasa et al., 2016] [Melo\net al., 2018] [Buljak et al., 2021] [Ni et al., 2021] together with experimental characterization. Some commercial FEM software, for example ABAQUS has the DPC model already\nimplemented for compaction simulations with density-dependent.\nMelo et al. [2018] described an experimental procedure (of closed-die and isostatic compaction) to validate the numerical models used to simulate the compaction of alumina\npowders. The authors applied the DPC constitutive model to represent the compaction\nbehavior of the material. The closed-die compaction leads to a non-homogeneous distribution in the pressing direction due to the friction between the powder and the die walls.\nThe pressed regions have a larger volumetric strain in the isostatic compaction, and the\ndensity distribution is more homogeneous.\nBesides, [Park & Kim, 2001] performed triaxial compression experimental tests on\ncompacted SiC powder materials under various con\u001cning pressure. These data were plotted in the p − q plane and the yield surfaces \u001ctted with the DPC and Cam-Clay models.\nA FEM closed-die compaction model was also proposed using these two models. Similar\nto Melo et al. [2018], the relative density in [Park & Kim, 2001] model was the highest\nat the corner of the contact surface between the upper punch and the die wall and the\nlowest at the corner of the contact surface between the lower punch and the die wall. Finally, the FEM calculations were compared with experimental compaction data, showing\na reasonable agreement.\n[Ni et al., 2021] also studied the closed-die compaction behavior of MgTiO3 ceramic\npowders using FEM simulations from the DPC model, and experimental data. The DPC\nmodel parameters were \u001ctted and calibrated from a long experimental protocol (uniaxial\ncompression, Brazilian, and uniaxial die compaction tests) under di\u001berent relative densities. Similar to [Park & Kim, 2001] and Melo et al. [2018], Ni et al. also observed a\npowder density gradient (Fig. 2.19) due to the presence of friction between the die walls\nand the powder.\nRecently [Buljak et al., 2021] performed compaction simulations on a VESUVIUS\n41\n\nCHAPTER 2.

Discrete Element Method\n\n2.7 Discrete Element Method\n2.7.1 Introduction\nAs seen in the previous section, powder compaction simulations using the \u001cnite element\nmethod (FEM) have been extensively described in the literature in the last few years.\nThe complex behavior of the powders is usually considered by calibrating constitutive\nequations (e.g., Drucker-Prager Cap and Bigoni-Piccolroaz models) with experimental\ndata. These model parameters are typically measured using standard soil mechanics\ntesting procedures [Pavier & Doremus, 1999]. However, measuring these parameters by\nexperiments can be a di\u001ecult task due to its complexity. For example, several triaxial\ncompression experimental tests are needed to describe the behavior of a powder in a\ncomplex stress state (p−q plane). As discussed in the preceding section, the experimental\nprogram may include uniaxial compression, Brazilian, closed-die compaction tests and\neven fully triaxial tests.\nThose constitutive equations may also be developed from micro-mechanics-based models ([Fleck, 1995] [Sridhar & Fleck, 2000]) together with experimental data. In Fleck,\ndensi\u001ccation is assumed to occur due to plastic deformation at the contact zones between neighboring particles. However, it uses several restrictive assumptions that may be\nquestionable to model complex ceramic composites.\nGranular media are discontinuous and heterogeneous by nature. Thus, the particulate\nnature of granular materials may be somewhat lost with the FEM as it works on a much\nlarger scale. Therefore, it is complex to realistically model the discrete nature of granular\nmatter during compaction with the FEM. Because of this, the Discrete Element Methods\n(DEM) have been specially developed to model granular materials at the particle scale\n(section 2.7.2). In the last few years, simulations using the discrete element method\n(DEM) have been proposed in the literature to release limitations from micro-mechanicsbased models, and better represent the particular behavior of powder materials. One\nof the many approaches of DEM includes establishing material behavior by considering\nparticles interaction and then using this constitutive data in a continuum model for an\nengineering part.\n\n2.7.2 What is DEM?\nThe discrete element method (DEM) simulation considers the behavior of a representative\nvolume element of a particulate matter. In numerical simulations based on DEM, each\nparticle is a set of individual objects that may interact with each other and be governed by\nthe conservation of momentum, di\u001berently than the FEM simulation in which the material\n43\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\nis represented as a continuum matter (Fig. 2.20). The advantage of DEM is that it allows\nconsidering some important behavior aspects of granular materials, for example, particles\nrearrangement, the creation, and loss of contacts between particles, the densi\u001ccation or\ndilatation of the material and the in\u001duence of interparticle friction.\n\nFigure 2.20: Representation of discrete and \u001cnite element scales.\nThis approach of modeling the behavior of granular matter was pioneered by Cundall\nand Strack in 1979 [Cundall & Strack, 1979] in which the interaction between two spherical\nparticles is described by regular functions. In this case, the individual particle was modeled\nconsidering its mass and moment of inertia, and the interactions between particles by\nemploying dashpots and springs [Ransing et al., 2000]. The expression of force between\ntwo particles into contact is in the function of their indentation. The initial approach by\nCundall and Strack was applied in the \u001celd of geomaterials (e.g., rocks). DEM has also\nbeen applied for diverse types of materials, including ceramic [Balakrishnan et al., 2010]\npowders. DEM has also been used to model fracture or buckling problems for initially\ncontinuous materials [Tan et al., 2009] [Nohut, 2004] [Leclerc, 2019] [Tan et al., 2009]\n[Kumar et al., 2016] [André et al., 2013] [Radi et al., 2020], and sintering [Martin et al.,\n2006b] of powder materials. Still, the interest in compaction behavior [Martin & Bouvard,\n2004] Skrinjar & Larsson [2004] Martin et al. [2006a] has been one of the main interests\nin the last few years.\nBut, what is the principle of DEM? The di\u001berent steps of a DEM simulation are\nshown in Fig. 2.21. Here, we will specialize the description to the case of a quasi-static\nsimulation, i.e., a simulation where the mechanical equilibrium of each particle is sought\nfor. These are simulations in which inertial e\u001bects can be neglected. This last assumption\nis reasonable for powder compaction processes.\nAt each time step, the overlap between particles is detected and used to compute\ninteraction forces. The di\u001berent detailed steps of a typical DEM simulation calculation\nare described in sequence:\n44\n\n2.7. Discrete Element Method\n\nFigure 2.21: Representation of the successive steps present in a DEM simulation.\nIn step 1, each particle is displaced by an increment ∆xi that follows a macroscopic\ndeformation imposed by a macroscopic strain rate tensor ε ̇ii :\n∆xi = ε ̇ii ∆xi ∆t\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere xi is the position of the particle along the i axis. ∆t is the time step. This \u001crst\nstep makes the particles move along the macroscopic deformation \u001celd (also known as the\na\u001ene solution) as if the powder is a continuous material. This approach is not always\napplied in DEM. However, it allows getting closer to quasi-static conditions. This \u001crst\nstep, for example, is very commonly used in molecular dynamics, and it was \u001crst proposed\nby [Thornton, 2000].\nIn step 2, after this a\u001ene solution, a list of all particles in contact with each other\nis determined. As the particles are represented by spheres, a simple calculation distance\nbetween them is enough to detect the contacts. Two particles are considered in contact if\nthe distance between the center of the spheres is less than the sum of their radius. Note\nthat to be e\u001ecient from a CPU time point of view, this stage is generally using a list of\npotential contacts (Verlet list) which is not recalculated at each time step and is using\na system of cells to easily detect contacts with neigbouring particles. Using these two\nmethods, the contact detection scheme only uses a few % of CPU time in quasi-static\nconditions.\n45\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\nIn step 3, the particles interact with each other depending on the speci\u001ced contact\nlaws, for example, elasticity, adhesion, contact breakage, etc. Once the type of contact\nlaws are detected, the normal and tangential force applied on each particle contact is\ncomputed as a function of the indentation between the particles (normal force) and their\nrelative motion (tangential forces). The contact failures, if the case, is also calculated at\nthis step. This stage is typically one of the most CPU consuming.\nIn step 4, the total force (including tangential and normal components of contact\nforces) applied to each particle is calculated. The total force applied on each particle is\ngiven as:\nFpart =\n\nX\n\nfcontact\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere fcontact are the forces applied at the particle contact. This step corresponds typically\nto 25% of the CPU time.\nIn step 5, the calculation of particle new positions at time t is determined using\nNewton's second law. The particle acceleration is \u001crst calculated from their forces and\nmasses, then a Verlet-velocity algorithm ([Levesque & Verlet, 1969]) is used to calculate\nthe velocity and the new position of the particles. This step corresponds typically to 5%\nof the CPU time.\nmẍ(t) = Fpart\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe DEM described in this manuscript is based on the DEM code dp3D (Discrete\nPowder 3D), which is developed at SIMaP laboratory and is dedicated mostly to materials\nscience applications.\nAs stated above, the numerical solution method applied in dp3D is on quasi-static\nconditions. Thus, phenomena related to the inertia of the system are negligible and have\nno in\u001duence on the near quasi-static equilibrium (Fpart → 0 for all particles). At the\nend of each time step simulation, particles should be close to a mechanical equilibrium\ncon\u001cguration. Di\u001berent criteria can be used to ensure that this quasi-static equilibrium\nis reached. For each particle, the following ratio (Ferror ) is given as:\nFerror =\n\n|Fpart |\nmax(|N |)\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere N is the normal contact force. The ratio should be less than 0.01 to ensure that\n46\n\n2.7. Discrete Element Method\n\nthe mechanical equilibrium of each particle was reached.\nTo analyze if the simulation is under quasi-static conditions, the normalized kinetic\nenergy per particle can also be calculated (chapter 4):\nẼkin =\n\nEkin\nn max(N R)\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere Ekin is the total kinetic energy of the particle system, n the number of particles, N\nthe normal force, and R is the particle radius. max(N R) is the maximum of the product\nof contact force and particle radius in the packing. Agnolin et al. ([Agnolin & Roux,\n2007]) showed that the simulations must meet the condition of Ẽkin < 10−7 to ensure a\nquasi-static system. For the purpose that this condition is met, low enough strain rates\nshould be employed (chapter 4).\nWhen the quasi-static conditions are met, the mass of the particles is renormalized\naccording to Eq. (2.5). The increase of the mass of the particle allows the rise in the time\nstep. The time step is given as:\nr\n∆t ∝\n\nm\nKn\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhere Kn is the normal sti\u001bness of the contact.\nHere, an introduction was presented to how typical calculations are performed in dp3D\nusing the discrete element method. In chapter 4, the contact laws applied in this Ph.D.\nwork are described in detail.\n\n2.7.3 Application of DEM to composites\nVarious industrial processes involve the consolidation of mixtures of powders with di\u001berent mechanical properties. Some experimental ([Lafer et al., 1993] [Roure et al., 1999]\n[Bouvard, 2000]) and numerical ([Martin et al., 2003] [Martin & Bouvard, 2004] [Skrinjar\n& Larsson, 2004]) studies, for example, were focused on investigating the densi\u001ccation\nbehavior of a mixture composed of hard and soft particles. The multi-particle \u001cnite element method (MPFEM) was also applied to model the compression behavior of a mixture\nof ductile and brittle particle assemblies ([Ransing et al., 2000], [Ransing et al., 2004]),\nof di\u001berent Al/SiC compositions ([Huang et al., 2017]), Cu-W composites ([Peng et al.,\n2021]). [Leclerc et al., 2019] coupled \u001cnite and discrete elements to simulate thermally induced stresses and local damage in ceramic-metal composites. [Alhajj Hassan et al., 2020]\nsimulated the thermal-induced damage in powder composites (continuous material in a\nheterogeneous medium) using the cohesive beam model. Generally, exist several studies\nin the literature applying numerical simulations and experiments related to composites\nmade of metal-ceramic materials for the powder-metallurgy process. As far as we know,\n47\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\nno study has been reported yet in the literature regarding compaction simulations using\nDEM to model refractory composites on a mixture of hard particles and a soft binder.\n[Martin et al., 2003] performed DEM isostatic simulations of packing with a mixture\nof ideally plastic soft and hard elastic particles (Fig. 2.22 a). The e\u001bect of the presence\nof hard elastic particles in di\u001berent content (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40% volume) on the macroscopic stresses (normalized) is shown in Fig. 2.22 b). It can be seen that the increase of\nhard particles leads to an increase in pressure at a given relative density.\n\nFigure 2.22: a) Numerical sample after isostatic compaction (RD=0.9). Hard particles\nare white and soft particles are grey. b) Evolution of the macroscopic pressure versus\nrelative density (0, 10, 20, 30, and 40% of hard particles). The macroscopic pressure is\nnormalized (Σ1 is the yield stress of the soft particles).\n\nSome authors also investigated the compaction behavior [Martin & Bouvard, 2004]\n[Wu et al., 2017] [Ramírez-Aragón et al., 2018], and sintering [Martin et al., 2015] of\nmodel powder materials containing di\u001berent particles size. [Martin & Bouvard, 2004],\nfor example, mixed the two concepts. Martin et al. studied: i) homogeneous sample\nin which all particles have the same material properties, but di\u001berent particles size, and\nii) heterogeneous sample made of a mixture between soft and hard particles (but also\nhaving di\u001berent particles size). In summary, Martin et al. ([Martin & Bouvard, 2004])\nshowed that bimodal samples (made of a mixture between small and large particles) exhibited a sti\u001ber response when compared to monomodal ones during isostatic compaction\n48\n\n2.7. Discrete Element Method\n\nsimulations. Also, the unloading and tensile strength are shown to be dependent on the\nbimodality of the compact (the tensile strength decreases with the increase of particle\nsize). In other words, the spring back during unloading and the resulting green strength\nof a bimodal sample was mainly controlled by the smallest particles when the volume\nfraction of large particles was not too large.\n\n2.7.4 Application of DEM to generate yield surfaces\nThe modeling of the compaction behavior of powders can be investigated using pressuredensity-dependent equations [R. W. Heckel, 1961], [Kawakita & Lüdde, 1971] (section\n2.5); and by micro-mechanical based models [Fleck et al., 1992; Fleck, 1995; Henderson\net al., 2001]. These models, or some constitutive equations (e.g., Drucker-Prager Cap and\nBigoni-Piccolroaz models, sections 2.6.1 and 2.6.2) which parameters can be identi\u001ced\nthrough experimental data may be implemented into a \u001cnite element method (FEM) code\nto simulate the compaction behavior of a part for industrial applications, for example.\nThe most critical step is the identi\u001ccation of the parameters that are introduced in\nthose constitutive equations. In other words, the experimental characterization to identify\nthose parameters for modeling the compaction behavior of powder materials is a di\u001ecult\ntask. In these circumstances, the discrete element method (DEM) may be applied as\na tool for generating constitutive equations by modeling the material behavior at the\nparticle contact scale to feed a FEM code. Some authors performed DEM simulations to\ndevelop yield surfaces of metal [Redanz & Fleck, 2001], ceramic powder materials [Pizette\net al., 2010], and soil materials [de Bono & McDowell, 2018]. Other similar studies used\nthe multi-particle \u001cnite element method [Abdelmoula et al., 2017] [Loidolt et al., 2019].\nThese yield surfaces generated by DEM may be used, for example, to \u001ct the yield surfaces\nfrom a DPC model.\nUsually, triaxial compression experimental tests are applied at various con\u001cning pressure to build the yield surface. Pizzete et al. ([Pizette et al., 2010]) performed various\nDEM simulations on particle aggregates to explore fracture and yield surfaces. The model\nparameters used in DEM were calibrated with experimental data of UO2 ceramic powders.\nFig. 2.23 shows the various numerical simulations that were carried out in their work.\nIn Pizette et al. ([Pizette et al., 2010]), the packing was \u001crst compacted uniaxially\nand unloaded. From the unloading point, several reloading paths (triaxial tests) were\napplied under compressive strain to explore the yield surface. The reloading simulations\nstopped when the packing reached the same relative density (D) retrieved at the end\nof the compaction. Fig. 2.24 a) shows the isodensity contour, which was obtained by\nconnecting those reloading points with the same density (D=0.59). The fracture points\nwere assumed at the maximum axial stress (z -axis) together with a decrease in coordinate\n49\n\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n\nFigure 2.23: Schematic of some DEM simulations carried out in Pizette et al. ([Pizette\net al., 2010]) for the generation of yield and fracture surfaces [Pizette et al., 2010].\nnumber.\nThe e\u001bect of the consolidation path on the shape of the isodensity yield surface was\nalso investigated by Pizette et al. ([Pizette et al., 2010]), see Fig. 2.24 b). The isodensity\nyield points and fracture points of a compact, which have been obtained by closed-die\ncompaction (from Fig. 2.24 a), are compared with a compact obtained by isostatic compaction. It was observed a clear di\u001berence between both surfaces, which shows the e\u001bect\nof the strain history.\n\n2.7.5 Application of DEM to refractories\nGenerally, refractory materials are very heterogeneous, exhibiting a multi-phase composition. Indeed, their microstructure presents some discontinuities (such as inclusions,\ncracks, debonding, porosity). One of the main advantages of DEM is the possibility of\ninvestigating the interaction between these di\u001berent phases to represent the macroscopic\nbehavior of the composite (Fig. 2.25 a).\nHowever, the application of the discrete element method to model the mechanical\nbehavior of refractory materials is quite recent [M. H. Moreira et al., 2020] [RamírezAragón et al., 2020] [Asadi et al., 2022] and has not been explored yet considering the\nmicrostructure of commercial refractory composite materials (e.g., carbon-bonded based\ncomposites). Although the possibilities of using DEM on refractory composites are vast\n50\n\n2.7.

LITERATURE REVIEW\nRecently [M. H. Moreira et al., 2020] carried out destructive mechanical tests (Brazilian, uniaxial compression, and 3-point bending) on alumina castable refractories. These\ntests were performed experimentally and by DEM simulations using the cohesive beam\nmodel [André et al., 2012] [Leclerc, 2019] (Fig. 2.25 b). In general, the numerical simulations in [M. H. Moreira et al., 2020] showed the capacity of reproducing the mechanical\nbehavior of the experimental tests both qualitatively (crack path) and quantitatively\n(Young's modulus and failure load), mainly on 3-point bending tests. Nevertheless, considering the 3-point bending and uniaxial compression tests, the maximum stress (fracture\nstress) from stress-strain curves in DEM was below the experimental stress (16%-29%).\nThe authors ([M. H. Moreira et al., 2020]) assumed that this di\u001berence in the stress may\nbe correlated with the Rankine calibration criterion applied in DEM for calibration.\nAlso, [Ramírez-Aragón et al., 2020] simulated the powder compaction of refractory\nmaterials (MgO and Al2 O3 ) using the discrete element method (DEM) with two cohesive\ncontact models (described in [Ramírez-Aragón et al., 2018]), see Fig. 2.26. In those\nsimulations, some mechanisms and properties were analyzed, such as the force applied to\nthe punch, porosity, \u001cnal shape of the samples after compaction, the in\u001duence of Young's\nmodulus, cohesion energy, and the particles' diameter. The simulations were calibrated\nand compared with experimental data. The Young's modulus and cohesion energy density\n(CED) were the input DEM parameters that most impacted the macroscopic compaction\nbehavior (maximum force, porosity). The CED is the ratio between the normal cohesion\nforce and the contact area between the interacting particles. The maximum force (at\nfracture) increased signi\u001ccantly with Young's modulus and the decrease of the CED.\nA summary of some of the numerical models using DEM applied to ceramic and\nrefractory materials is described in Table 2.3. It includes the material, type of modeling,\ncontact model 1 , some of the principal results, and the respective references.\n\n1\n\nThe contact models used in our work are described in chapter 4.\n\n52\n\n2.7.

Conclusions\n\n2.8 Conclusions\nContinuum mechanical modeling with \u001cnite element method is very popular to evaluate\nthe compaction behavior of powder materials. The Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC) model\nis currently one of the most applied constitutive equations for compaction modeling of\nindustrial parts. Furthermore, it is already implemented in commercial FEM software.\nHowever, the experimental characterization for the identi\u001ccation of the DPC model parameters is relatively complex and long. For this purpose, using the discrete element\nmethod (DEM) may be bene\u001ccial as it considers the particulate behavior of heterogeneous powder materials. The DEM may be used to provide information on the behavior\nof the powder for stress states that are impossible or di\u001ecult to attain with triaxial tests\ndue to its complexity. As far as we know, DEM has not been applied yet to generate\nyield and fracture surfaces of composite powder materials, and especially to refractories\nfor steel casting applications.\nIn short, the methodology that we will adopt in this Ph.D. is \u001crst to characterize the\ncomplex behavior of a composite refractory material (from VESUVIUS) experimentally\n(chapter 3) to represent the compaction behavior (chapter 5) and its mechanical response\nafter \u001cring (chapter 6) using the DEM. One of the most important stages in DEM is\nto compute the contact forces between particles (section 2.7.2). These forces need to\naccurately describe the contact between di\u001berent phases of the refractory composite to\nrepresent its macroscopic behavior. In our case, the composite is composed of alumina\nparticles, graphite, and binder. These forces are described in detail in chapter 4 through\nappropriated contact models. We can anticipate that as the binder is not considered\na discrete compound, we will need to represent it di\u001berently in the DEM framework.\nOnce these stages are completed (experimental characterization and DEM modeling of\nthe composite), we can deploy the DEM methodology to explore complex stress states to\ngenerate yield surfaces that are di\u001ecult to obtain experimentally.\nBy the end, this Ph.D. aims to propose a numerical tool to feed FEM with yield and\nfracture surfaces generated by DEM using the DPC model for compaction modeling of\nindustrial parts. Chapter 7 is the \u001crst attempt to show a typical use of this methodology,\nmodeling the compaction of the composite refractory in the closed-die con\u001cguration using\nthe Drucker-Prager Cap model.\n\n55\n\nChapter 3\nExperimental characterization\nThe materials to be studied in this Ph.D. work are complex heterogeneous powder composites composed of alumina grains and graphite embedded into a phenolic resin. Good\nknowledge of the microstructure (morphology, composition) is important for the modeling\npart. Thus, in this chapter, \u001crst, microscopical observations of a carbon-bonded alumina\nrefractory for steel casting applications are described. For this purpose, SEM and X-ray\ntomography analysis were carried out on a reference composite (sections 3.4 and 3.5). Four\ndi\u001berent composites are studied with distinct compositions. Their manufacturing process\ncomprises four main steps: mix preparation, compaction, curing, and \u001cring. X-ray tomography images are used to highlight the microstructure evolution: before compaction, after\ncompaction, and \u001cring stages. In section 3.6, the theoretical density, the bulk density,\nand the open porosity of cured and \u001cred microstructures are compared. The densi\u001ccation response of these powder materials is also identi\u001ced through close-die compaction\nexperiments by evaluating the e\u001bects of density and composition on the green mechanical\nbehavior. The green mechanical strength is analyzed through uniaxial and triaxial compression tests (section 3.7). The thermo-mechanical behavior of such materials is carried\nout by TGA (section 3.9.1) and dilatometry (section 3.9.2) experiments. In TGA, the\nresin weight loss (%) of cured samples is estimated as a function of the testing temperature. In dilatometry characterization, the coe\u001ecient of thermal expansion of the four\ncomposites is measured on both cured and \u001cred samples. Finally, their mechanical characterization after the \u001cring is investigated by destructive tests (uniaxial and compression\ntests and diametrical tests), followed by an estimation of their yield locus and failure\nenvelope in the mean and deviatoric stress plane (section 3.10).\n\n57\n\nCHAPTER 3.

EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\n\n3.2 Introduction\nCarbon-bonded refractories are heterogeneous and complex granular composites made\nof solid alumina grains and graphite embedded into a polymeric resin (transformed into\npyrolytic carbon during the \u001cnal heat treatment). These materials are designed to resist harsh steel casting environments (between 1500°C and 1600°C) involving thermal\nshock and oxidation/corrosion mechanisms. Mechanical, physical, and chemical properties should imperatively be controlled in the whole industrial process 'e.g., casting). Each\nconstituent plays a speci\u001cc role: grains limit the carbon dissolution in steel, graphite\nbrings the non-wetting and enhanced thermal conductivity, whereas the pyrolytic carbon\ncontinuum is responsible for the mechanical strength and thermal shock resistance thanks\nto its limited thermal expansion. It is a delicate balance between di\u001berent properties.\nThe key for engineering such composite relies on a good understanding of the relationship\nbetween the manufacturing conditions, microstructure, and resulting properties.\nFor this purpose, a few years ago, Vesuvius started studying model refractory composite materials. They are simpli\u001ced compositions aimed at better understanding their microstructure and mechanical/thermo-mechanical properties with their composition. Thus,\nfor the present Ph.D. work, a model alumina-carbon model material, free of any other\nadditive, was prepared as the reference material along with this study. The other three\ncomposites were as well prepared simply by modifying the volume fraction of coarse and\nne alumina grains, graphite, and binder content. Their manufacturing process consists\nof four main steps. First, the mix-manufacturing (or mixing of raw materials) where the\npowder grains are agglomerated, forming pellets that are a few tens of millimetres. Second,\nthese powders are shaped via two routes: isostatic or closed-die compaction, depending\non the application (targeted \u001cnal product shape). The sample after the compaction is the\n'green body'. Third, the obtained green body is cured at 200°C, leading to evaporation of\nthe solvent and reticulation of the phenolic resin. Finally, the cured refractory is followed\nby a \u001cring process at approximately 900°C, and the \u001cnal properties are measured (chapter\n2).\nIn this chapter, \u001crst, we introduce some essential information on the overall microstructure by SEM and X-ray tomography analysis. The reference composite is \u001crst submitted\nto image analysis to investigate its microstructure to understand better the mechanical and thermo-mechanical behavior of such carbon-bonded alumina refractories. The\nphysical properties (theoretical density, bulk density, and open porosity) are measured.\nLikewise, closed-die compaction tests are carried out, followed by mechanical tests. In\nsequence, thermal analysis is performed to investigate the refractory composite behavior\nafter the curing and \u001cring steps. Finally, mechanical testing is performed to estimate the\n60\n\n3.3. Design of powder composites\n\ncomposite mechanical properties and elastic/plastic behavior after the \u001cring stage.\n\n3.3 Design of powder composites\nThe microstructure of the model composite is shown in Fig. 3.1. It can be thought of\nas an overlapping hierarchy, with a mesoscale made of coarse hard grains (white fused\nalumina with 250μm average size) and graphite (<400μm) reinforcing a matrix; itself constituted at microscale of \u001cne grains (calcined alumina <50μm) embedded into a pyrolytic\ncarbonaceous binder (a mixture of resin and solvent).\n\nFigure 3.1: Schematic representation of a alumina-graphite powder composite aggregate,\ncomposed of coarse grains and graphite \u001dakes embedded into a continuum matrix.\nThe mix and the granulating process can be decomposed into three main steps. First,\nthe solid raw materials (oxides, graphite, resin) are weighted according to the composite\nrecipe. Second, these raw materials are loaded into a mixer. The solvent is added during\nthe mixing, generating a temperature increase due to frictional forces. The mixing stops\nwhen the temperature reaches 50° C [Gardziella et al., 2000]. Finally, the excess solvent\npreviously added to disperse the binder properly is removed during a drying cycle, blowing\nhot air at 100 °C and continuously shaking the mix.\nA good mix engineering at this stage means obtaining the desired pellet size and\nmaximizing their packing density: neither dusty (lack of binder) nor sticky (excess of\nbinder) for the next process step [Dupuy, 2015]. This powder composite is conditioned in\na controlled atmosphere and closed barrel to limit as much solvent evaporation as possible.\nIn the present work, four di\u001berent composites are investigated with di\u001berent compositions (Table 3.1) with special emphasis on numerical simulations. Mix 1 can be considered\nthe standard composite; mix 2 matrix exhibits a lack of binder (excess of \u001cne grains).\n61\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\nWhereas mix 3 is in the opposite trend (excess of binder and lack of \u001cne alumina grains).\nConcerning Mix 4, the matrix composition of mix 1 is used but with an overall depleted\nmatrix (40 % on mix 4 against 45 % volume fraction on mix 1, 2, and 3). In turn, mix\n4 has an excess of coarse alumina grains and graphite. As can be understood from these\ndescriptions, the objective in mix 2 and mix 4 was to generate a model composite with an\nexcess of solid grains. In contrast, mix 3 presents an excess of the binder.

The images highlight the above-mentioned hierarchical microstructure with coarse alumina (a few hundred μm) and elongated graphite \u001dakes observed at\nlow magni\u001ccation. The matrix embedding the reinforcement, appearing in grey at low\nmagni\u001ccation, is composed of \u001cne calcined alumina grains and binder, visible for magni\u001ccation >x1000. It is worth noting that the geometry of coarse grains is erratic (dispersed\nin shape but generally angular), whereas the graphite \u001dakes are mostly planar. Fine calcined alumina grains exhibit mostly rounded shapes. As mentioned above, these coarse\nalumina grains (white fused alumina) are visualized in di\u001berent dimensions, with an average size of 250μm. Some more rounded \u001cne calcined alumina grains can also be noticed\nin Fig. 3.2 d). The graphite \u001dakes can be deformed during the compaction stage, and\nsome micro-cracks can be observed at higher magni\u001ccation. The alumina grains remain\nuna\u001bected (Figs. 3.2 c) and d).\n\n62\n\n3.5. X-ray tomography\n\nFigure 3.2: SEM images at increasing magni\u001ccations: a)x56, b)x200, c)x600, and\nd)1995x. Typical alumina-graphite refractory composite (mix 1) composed of white fused\nalumina grains and graphite \u001dakes embedded into a carbonaceous bonding matrix.\n\n3.5 X-ray tomography\nIn addition to SEM, X-ray computed tomography analysis (CT, done at SIMAP laboratory, Grenoble, France) is performed on mix aggregate samples to examine the overall microstructure arrangement. This investigation is restricted to the reference powder\ncomposite material, mix 1. The experiment consists of taking X-ray images of a sample\ntilted by a small angle for each image. The whole volume of the imaged specimen is reconstructed by assembling the digital images. The resulting 3D image is a superimposed\nprojection of a volume in a 2D plane [Salvo et al., 2003]. The CT analyses are performed\nat three stages of the process (sample size ranging from 0.7 mm to 1.9 mm): on mix aggregate, a compacted green sample, and a \u001cred sample (Fig. 3.3) fragments. The resolution\nof CT images depends on several parameters, including the voxel size applied during the\nanalysis. Typically, the smaller the voxel size is, the better is the image resolution. All\nsamples were \u001crst analyzed at a voxel size of about 0.59 μm - 1.19 μm size. The last\ntest was repeated with a higher resolution to highlight potential microstructure damage\nassociated with the \u001cring process, leading to a voxel size of 0.59 μm (Table 3.2). Note that\nthe gray levels in a CT slice image correspond to the X-ray attenuation, i.e., re\u001decting the\nproportion of X-rays scattered or absorbed as they pass through each voxel. The X-ray\n63\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\nattenuation is highly dependent on the X-ray energy, material density, and composition.\nTypically, alumina grains are denser and absorb more photons by the beam than porosity\nand graphite.\n\nFigure 3.3: Evolution of mix 1 aggregate microstructure (2D slice from a 3D fragment\nimage accessed through CT analysis).

X-ray tomography\n\nThe tomography image also reveals some large pores in the agglomerate sample before\ncompaction that are mainly located around coarse grains (Fig. 3.3 a). Though, this\nporosity is not observed after the compaction to the same extent. Likewise, some porosity\nis noticed mainly around the coarse alumina on the \u001cred sample (Fig. 3.3 c), attributed\nto the so-called \"bell e\u001bect\" and within the matrix phase. The bell e\u001bect originates from\nthe plastic deformation of the organic binding phase during the \u001cring, accommodating\ngrain thermal expansion. Above 700-800 °C, the binder becomes sti\u001ber, leading to some\nporosity surrounding the grains.\nConsequently, during the cooling, the shrinkage of grains will not be accompanied by\nan identical shrinkage in the pyrolytic phase, and the grains will detach from the shell\nsurrounding them. These decohesions within the material microstructure contribute to the\ndecreasing coe\u001ecient of thermal expansion and the thermal shock resistance [Dupuy, 2015]\n[?]. The debonding occurs \u001crst at the interface aggregate-matrix, and after, microcracks\nare propagated within the matrix leading to a composite macroscopic rupture [Schmitt\net al., 2002]. A higher resolution was required to highlight this e\u001bect on coarse grains,\nbut it remains insu\u001ecient for \u001cne grains.\nX-ray tomography also highlighted porosity surrounding graphite \u001dakes suggesting\nthat not only coarse alumina but also graphite \u001dakes detach during cooling from the\nsurrounding matrix due to the signi\u001ccantly lower coe\u001ecient of thermal expansion of the\npyrolyzed binder compared with alumina and graphite. The anisotropic thermal expansion\nof graphite \u001dakes could add up to this e\u001bect [Werner et al., 2013].\nThe coarse alumina grains, matrix, graphite, and porosity can be highlighted due to\nthe contrasting shades of grayscale associated with each phase. Thus, these images were\nbinarized using a thresholding method, as white as the highlighted region of interest, using\nImageJ and Analysis 3D plugin [Boulos et al., 2012] to distinguish the di\u001berent phases\nof the aggregate and their respective percentage (in pixel size). The plugin was helpful\nto discriminate the graphite from the grain's outer region as both have a similar gray\nlevel. The plugin can also measure the volume of each phase based on the marching cube\nalgorithm. The 3D region is divided into cubes, such that the vertices of each cube are a\nvoxel [Lorensen & Cline, 1987]. Nevertheless, in this work, the percentage of each phase\nwas associated with the calculated pixels of thresholded regions from each image slice.\nThus, predicting the % variance based on the shape of the agglomerate from each image\nslice.\nAn example of a 3D thresholding analysis of a \u001cred sample composed of 1218 x 1343\nx 1218 pixels (performed at 0.59 μm voxel size) is exhibited in Fig. 3.4. The white colors\ncorrespond to the thresholded regions of interest. The images on the left correspond to CT\nimages reduced into 8-bit layers, and the ones on the right are the result of thresholding\n65\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\nbased on the CT image's grayscale range. Hence, three main phases could be distinguished: graphite (Fig. 3.4 a), matrix (Fig. 3.4 b), and coarse/medium alumina grains\n(Fig. 3.4 c). The porosity could be identi\u001ced by the di\u001berence between the thresholded\ngrain contour (Fig. 3.4 d) and phases a), b), and c). It is worth noting that the matrix\nwas not further subdivided into the binder and \u001cne grains because it was not possible to\ndistinguish each other with the selected tomography resolution.\n\nFigure 3.4: Representation of thresholding (white as the region of interest) applied in a binarized 3D image. The phases were separated into a) graphite, b) matrix, c) large/medium\nalumina grains. In d), the threshold highlights the whole grain.\nBesides the thresholding, a segmentation method was also applied by assigning a range\nof grey levels (from color 0 to 255, black to white) to distinguish the di\u001berent phases of\ninterest (Fig. 3.5). In summary, image segmentation is a technique of partitioning the\noriginal image into distinct phases. The white color (255) represents large and medium\nalumina grains. The grey color (215) represents the matrix. The darker grayscale (color\n120) represents the graphite phase, and the black color (color 0) inside the grain is the\nporosity. The threshold method was applied using, for instance, tools like 'remove outliers,' '\u001cll holes,' and 'dilate' in the ImageJ program, and by the \u001clter '3D fast median'\nfrom the Analysis 3D plugin. The segmentation was applied after the thresholding since\nthe thresholded phases could be checked if correctly separated by comparing with the\noriginal CT 3D images.\nAs mentioned above, the percentage of each phase could be extracted from the thresh66\n\n3.5. X-ray tomography\n\nFigure 3.5: Example of a segmentation method by assigning a range of grey levels from\nwhite to black (see greyscale legend). The segmentation was applied in the image volume\n(3D) by considering the four distinct phases (coarse/medium alumina grains, matrix,\ngraphite, and porosity) identi\u001ced previously at the threshold (Fig. 3.4).\n\nolding (Fig. 3.4) applied to the four X-ray tomography analyses: agglomerate, green,\nand two \u001cred grain samples (performed at two di\u001berent voxel sizes). The percentage of\nthe total quanti\u001ced white pixels, from each binary slice image, of four distinct phases:\ncoarse/medium alumina grains, matrix (a mixture of \u001cne alumina grains and binder),\ngraphite, and porosity is listed in Fig. 3.6. In contrast with SEM analysis, where the\nsample needs to be polished and embedded in epoxy resin, this step is not required for\nX-ray tomography analysis, allowing easier porosity quanti\u001ccation. Fig. 3.6 a) shows the\n% content of each phase of the agglomerate grain sample (before compaction), Fig. 3.6\nb) of the green grain sample (after compaction at 35 MPa), Fig. 3.6 c) the \u001cred sample\n(from the X-ray tomography at 1.08μm voxel size), and Fig. 3.6 d) is also an after-\u001cred\ngrain sample, analyzed with a higher resolution (0.59μm voxel size). Note that the % of\neach phase is a\u001bected by the X-ray tomography resolution and on the aggregate geometry\nitself.\nThe % of each phase, identi\u001ced from thresholding, is presented in Table 3.3. The open\nporosity of the \u001cred sample was additionally measured by Archimedes' method (16.9%\n± 0.1). This value exceeds the values estimated from X-ray tomography. The value at\nthe highest CT resolution (13.4% porosity) is closer to Archimede's value but still lower.\nThis is due to the \u001cner pores not being thresholded by CT even at this resolution. Thus,\nfrom this table, and knowing that the same threshold was applied in both analyses, it\ncan be concluded that the tomography analysis resolution impacts the measurement of\n67\n\nCHAPTER 3.

The volume percentage of each sample is highly dependent\non the shape of the grain, and the resolution applied on CT analysis.\nThe volume fraction percentage of coarse and medium alumina grains is represented by\napproximately 23% for the \u001crst three CT analyses. And, 36% for the last test (performed\nat larger resolution), which is closest to the volume fraction of coarse alumina grains\nof mix 1 (reference composite) recipe, that is 33%. The % of graphite and matrix for\nmix 1 recipe is 22%, and 45%, that is closest to the image analysis done at the third\nCT test (21%, and 44% for the graphite and matrix, respectively). However, it is worth\nhighlighting that the volume fraction of the composite recipes do not re\u001dect the porosity\ncontent, only for raw materials. Also, the quanti\u001ccation of each phase through image\nanalysis can depend on the image resolution, the grain shape, and it is representative of\none unique millimetric agglomerate.\n68\n\n3.6.

The theoretical density is\nan important parameter for the measurement of the relative density during close die\ncompaction. In sequence, the powder composites bulk density and open porosity after\ncuring (to 200°C) and after \u001cring are measured by Archimedes' principle.\n\n3.6.1 Theoretical density\nThe theoretical density (ρ), measured in g/cm3 , corresponds to the material density, once\npressed, is fully dense (no porosity). In this work, the composite theoretical density was\nestimated by the \"Rule of Mixtures,\" knowing the volume fraction of each constituent\n(white fused alumina, \u001cne calcined alumina, graphite, and binder) and their respective\ndensities (Table 3.4). The main objective of knowing the composites' theoretical densities\nis to describe their densi\u001ccation behavior during compaction experiments. The composite\ntheoretical density can be written as:\nρ=\n\nX\n\nρ i · νi\n\n(3.1)\n\nwith ρ as the loose composite density, and ρi and νi are the density and volume fraction\nof each constituent, respectively.\nThe theoretical density, in g/cm3 , of the four composite recipes is reported in Table\n3.5, considering the raw materials volume fraction related to each composite (Table 3.1).\n69\n\nCHAPTER 3.

These measurements were performed on cured (after a heating treatment close to 200°C) and \u001cred\nsmall cylindrical samples. Firstly, the weight of a dry sample is measured (m1 ). Next,\nthe sample is submerged into water (ρw is the water density, 1 g/cm3 ) under vacuum.\nThus the liquid begins \u001clling the pores. After approximately 1 hour, the weight of the\nfully in\u001cltrated sample is measured (m2 ). In water suspension, the weight (m3 ) of the\nwet sample is also measured. The bulk density and open porosity can be calculated using\nthe following equations:\nm1\nρw\nm3 − m2\n\n(3.2)\n\nm3 − m1\n· 100%\nm3 − m2\n\n(3.3)\n\nρ=\n\nP =\n\nThe bulk density, and the porosity of each composite, after curing and after \u001cring, are\nlisted in Tables 3.6 and 3.7, respectively. A total of two samples for each composite and\neach condition (cured or \u001cred) were analyzed (globally 16 measurements).\nIt can be noticed in Table 3.6 that all the cured samples show a very low amount\nof open porosity, except the composite with a lack of binder wt% (mix 2) that shows\na signi\u001ccantly larger amount of porosity (12.5%) as compared to the reference mix 1\n(5.1%). The composite with more binder content, mix 3 (4.5%), exhibits a slight decrease\nin porosity, and mix 4 (6.4%) has more porosity than mix 1. A low binder content results\n70\n\n3.6.

Fig. 3.7 sketches this phenomena linking binder\nvolume fraction with porosity.\nIn Table 3.7, the bulk density and open porosity percentage on \u001cred samples are shown.\nIn general, the bulk densities of \u001cred microstructures are lower than the cured ones due\nto the resin pyrolysis that mostly happens during the \u001cring stage. Consequently, due\nto the elimination (evaporation) of some binder content during pyrolysis, some porosity\nis introduced into the \u001cred microstructure. Concerning the recipe containing an excess\nof calcined alumina and lack of binder (mix 2), the open porosity evolves in the same\nway as the cured one. The open porosity increases with an excess of \u001cne alumina grains\nand a lack of binder (mix 2). Nonetheless, the increase of porosity was more signi\u001ccant\nat the cured stage than the pyrolyzed one (\u001cred). The bulk density and the porosity\n% of mix 1-4 are in agreement with [Werner et al., 2014] where carbon-bonded alumina\nrefractories (without additives and \u001cred at 1,000°C), compacted at 40 MPa, presented\napparent porosity and bulk density of approximately 18% and 2.60 g/cm3 . In [Dupuy,\n2015] the bulk density and open porosity of carbon-bonded composites after the \u001cring\nvaries between 2.86-2.97 g/cm3 , and the open porosity ranges between 16.20-18.30%.\n\n71\n\nCHAPTER 3.

The\nobjective is to identify and understand the composition e\u001bect on material densi\u001ccation\nand its green mechanical behavior. The e\u001bect of density on these latter properties was\nfurther evaluated for di\u001berent compaction pressures on the reference mix 1: 10 MPa, 35\nMPa, and 100 MPa.\n72\n\n3.7. Green mechanical testing\n\n3.7.1 Close-die compaction\nThe close die compaction experimental setup consists of a steel die with an internal\ndiameter, in which the mix pellets are inserted. An upper punch moves inwards, applying\nstress to the powder and compacting it following the set cycle. Once the nominal end\nstress is reached, the unloading stage is initiated. The compaction aims to replicate the\nindustrial pressing cycle, which is time-controlled.\nThe powder with a mass of approximately 140-143 g is inserted in a 40 mm diameter\ndie. The cycle is divided into 3 stages: 1) preloading displacement (Fig. 3.8 a), 2) loading\n35 MPa, 3) controlled unloading stage. The nominal stress is achieved in approximately\n30 seconds, and the unloading takes a similar time. The preloading displacement aims at\navoiding overloading due to the large displacement involved in the early compaction stage.\nIt is worthwhile mentioning pieces containing several materials are commonly processed.\nTherefore, they need to have a normalized testing duration.\n\nFigure 3.8: Representation of close die compaction cycle (representative of the industrial\ncycle) with three steps. 1) pre-loading displacement controlled test. 2) compaction pressure target equivalent to 35 MPa. 3) controlled unloading stage.\nThe rigidity of the equipment is determined by means of the so-called \"white test\". It\nconsists of performing a compaction experiment without any powder. Thus, the displacement of the device at a given pressure is obtained. Generally, the behavior is linear. The\ndeformation of the equipment is then subtracted from the compaction curve of the studied\npowder composite. Thus, any recorded displacement corresponds to the actual mix height\n(h) in the die. Knowing the mix mass and die diameter makes it possible to obtain the\ndensity during the test directly. In Fig. 3.9 the close-die compaction and unloading of\nMix 1 is shown. It presents the compaction pressure against the mix deformation (h0 − h)\ncurve, where h0 =74.56 mm is the initial mix height, and h is the actual mix height that\ndecreases along with the compaction.\n73\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\nStarting from h=h0, during the \u001crst 15 mm, the pressure remains close to zero due\nto grains rearrangement and the high porosity; only a few contacts counteract the piston\nmovement. Above 20 mm, the pressure increases signi\u001ccantly with the powder deformation as the contact area between grains increases. The unloading stage may be divided in\ntwo parts: between 35 MPa and approximately 30 Mpa, the powder continues to densify,\nbelow 20 MPa the powder experiences some spring-back with some dilatation (decrease\nof the density). This phenomenon can be explained by the visco-plasticity behavior of\nthe green composite material due to the binder. In the early stage of the unloading,\nvisco-plasticity remains the dominant phenomenon, and the binder phase is \"extruded\"\nin-between the grains (density keeps increasing). Below approximately 20 MPa, this mechanism is balanced by elasticity also called the spring back e\u001bect. In other words, upon\nreleasing the compaction pressure, the microstructure expands due to the elastic energy\nstored in the sample and a viscoelastic relaxation caused by the binder.\n\nFigure 3.9: Close die compaction-unloading curve: powder deformation (h0 − h) against\nthe compaction pressure of mix 1. The targeted nominal pressure is 35 MPa. h0 is the\ninitial powder height (h0 = 74.56 mm), and h is the actual powder height.\n\nE\u001bect of the composition on the compaction behavior\nTo evaluate the e\u001bect of the powder composite compositions (Mix 1-4) on the densi\u001ccation behavior, the green density is converted into relative density (ρr ). The relative\ndensity is de\u001cned as the ratio between the compacted powder density, obtained by pressing at a given pressure, and the theoretical density (ρ) (when the material is considered\nas fully dense). The theoretical density of the powder composites is listed in Table 3.5,\nand it was calculated considering the volume fraction of the raw materials in the mix.\nThe relative density (in %) writes:\n74\n\n3.7. Green mechanical testing\n\nρr =\n\nm1\n100\nV ρ\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere m is the powder mass, which is constant, V is the powder sample volume. The\npowder volume can be written as πr2 h with r the powder cylindrical sample radius, and\nh the powder sample height (which decreases during the compaction).\nPressure-relative density (ρr ) compaction curves of powder composites (mix 1-4) are\nplotted. The compaction response during the loading is shown in Fig. 3.10 a) and the\nunloading in Fig. 3.10 b). The objective of these close-die compaction trials is to extract\nthe powder composites densi\u001ccation curves (mix 1-4) with a compaction pressure target\nequivalent to 35 MPa (applied by Vesuvius for industrial applications) and to estimate\nthe viscoelastic recovery of the powder composite during the unloading stage. Here,\nthe compaction tests are not repeated for each composite. However, VESUVIUS has\nconducted multiple tests on similar mixes and the standard deviation, at a compaction\npressure of 35 MPa, is of the order of 0.3% on the relative density ([Mazerat, 2014]).\n\nFigure 3.10: Comparison of close die compaction experiments for mix 1 to 4 to a nominal\npressure of 35 MPa. Compaction pressure (MPa) evolution versus the relative density\n(%).\nDuring the compaction, when mix 1, 3, and 4 reach a density of 95%, it becomes\nmore di\u001ecult to densify the microstructure because contacts between particles grow signi\u001ccantly. At the maximum compaction pressure (35 MPa), a relative density of ρr =96%\nfor mix 3 (larger % of binder) and ρr =90% for mix 2 (reduced % of binder) are obtained\n(Table 3.8). Concerning Mix 2, this composite departs from the other materials for the\ndensi\u001ccation behavior. The higher \u001cne alumina particles content (+5%) and the lower\n75\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\nbinder content (-5%) in mix 2, compared with reference mix 1, suggests a sti\u001ber behavior\n(larger number of sti\u001b contacts between \u001cne calcined alumina grains and coarse alumina\ngrains). Consequently, it becomes more di\u001ecult to press the microstructure, thence the\nsmaller relative density.\nPowder composite ρr at 35 MPa (%) ρr at 30MPa (%) ρr end of unloading (%)\nMix 1 (standard)\n95.5\n95.9\n95.7\nMix 2\n90.0\n90.5\n89.8\nMix 3\n96.0\n96.6\n96.5\nMix 4\n94.0\n95.1\n94.7\nTable 3.8: Measurement of the relative density (ρr ) from close-die compaction tests: a)\nat the end of the loading (at ≈ 35 MPa), b) during the unloading (at ≈ 30 MPa), and c)\nat the end of the unloading (at 0 MPa).\nRegarding mix 4, a slight di\u001berence in the relative density, at 35 MPa, compared with\nthe reference mix 1 (-1.5%) can be observed. Mix 4 is a speci\u001cc composite compared to\nMix 1, 2, and 3 as it contains more reinforcement (a larger amount of coarse alumina and\ngraphite). This larger amount of reinforcement makes it slightly more di\u001ecult to compact\ncompared with Mix 1 and Mix 3. Still, it does not modify the compaction behavior of\nMix 4 drastically as compared to Mix 1, as shown by Fig. 3.10. This phenomenon\ndemonstrates the predominant e\u001bect of the binder. Possibly there is enough matrix to \u001cll\nthe inter-coarse grains voids and enough binder to \u001cll the inter-\u001cne grains voids.\nComparing Mix 1 and Mix 3, these two composites present only a 1% relative density di\u001berence at the end of the compaction (35 MPa). These two composites have a\nsimilar binder content (22.5% and 25%, respectively) and the same % of matrix content.\nThe binder \u001clls the inter-grain pores, increasing the relative density. These observations\nsuggest that the binder and \u001cne alumina grains are the materials that most impact the\npowder composites densi\u001ccation behavior. In other words, the compaction behavior is\nprobably dictated mostly by the matrix phase for the refractory composites studied in\nthis Ph.D. Still, it should not be a general statement for other refractories.\nThe unloading (and spring back e\u001bect), are shown in Fig. 3.10 b). At the beginning\nof the unloading (or when the pressure is still high), the four powder composites continue\nto densify slightly due to the binder. From approximately 35 MPa to 30 MPa, there is an\nincrease in ρr by approximately 0.48%, 0.38%, 0.60%, and 0.48% for Mix 1, Mix 2, Mix 3,\nand Mix 4, respectively. Mix 3, the recipe with more binder in its composition, presents\nthe highest increase in relative density (0.6%). In the opposite, Mix 2, that is the one\nwith less binder content, shows a lower density increase (0.3%) (Table 3.8). During the\nunloading, below 30 MPa, the spring-back e\u001bect leads to a relative density decrease of\napproximately 0.2%, 0.5%, and 0.2% for Mix 1, mix 3, and Mix 4, respectively. On Mix\n76\n\n3.7. Green mechanical testing\n\n2, this decrease counter balances the initial gain mentioned above: the relative density\nglobally decreases during the unloading stage.\nIn summary, usually, during compaction, the composite obeys to the interactions between two intricating scales: the reinforcement/matrix, and the \u001cne alumina grains/binder.\nHowever, the e\u001bect of matrix could be highlighted in these materials densi\u001ccation, but\nnot the e\u001bect of the reinforcement (coarse alumina and graphite). Hence, it could be concluded that during the loading, the \u001cne alumina and binder is the pair of raw materials\nthat most impacts the densi\u001ccation of powder composites.\nClosed-die compaction at di\u001berent pressures\nAdditional close-die compaction tests are carried out on Mix 1 reference composite,\nunder pressures of 10, 35, and 100 MPa (Fig. 3.11). The objective here is to generate\nsamples at three di\u001berent relative densities for triaxial uniaxial compression tests. For\nthis purpose, 9 samples are generated from compaction tests at each pressure, totalizing\n27 compacted samples. At 10 MPa, and 35 MPa, the relative density reached at the \u001cnal\nof the compaction, on average, is 84.5% ± 0.37 and 95.5% ± 0.30, respectively (Fig. 3.11.\nIn the test at 100 MPa, the samples reached a \u001cnal density of RD>100%. But, taking\npoints at the limit of these curves (RD=100%), the compaction pressure encountered is\n75.2 MPa ± 2.7. Thus, a pressure of ≈ 75 MPa should be high enough to have Mix 1\nfully compacted.\n\nFigure 3.11: Mix 1 close-die compaction curves at 10 MPa (RD≈84%), 35 MPa\n(RD≈95%) and at RD=100% (all samples).\n\nComposite ageing e\u001bect and moisture\n77\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\nSome important aspects may a\u001bect the compaction behavior of such carbon-bonded\nalumina refractory composites. Some examples include the interval of time between the\nmix composite manufacturing and the green characterization tests, the conditions of the\nmix storage, and the moisture (the solvent content).\nThe mixes in VESUVIUS are stored in a tightly closed, temperature-controlled tank\nto avoid signi\u001ccant solvent evaporation. In addition, it is imperative to use the mix in\ncompaction and green mechanical tests approximately 0-3 months after the mix manufacturing to avoid solvent evaporation and resin reticulation. In this Ph.D., the mixes\nfollowed the VESUVIUS protocols for storage and transportation. They were also submitted to closed-die compaction and after-testing (uniaxial/triaxial compression) within\n0-6 weeks (approximately one month and a half) after the mixes were manufactured.\nThese actions are important to avoid any discrepancy in the compaction behavior and\nmechanical properties. The use of the appropriate solvent adjustment also impacts the\nmix properties.\nFig. 3.12 a) exhibits the evolution of the compaction pressure vs. the relative density\nof the composite Mix 1 (reference) and the same composite compacted 9 months after the\nmanufacturing (old mix). In this example, at 35 MPa, the old mix has approximately a\n6% decrease in relative density. This phenomenon can be explained by progressive solvent\nevaporation and resin reticulation. Thus, after some months, the powder becomes more\ndi\u001ecult to compact.\nFig. 3.12 b) shows the evolution of the compaction pressure vs. the relative density\nof the composite Mix 1 (reference) and the same composite, but with di\u001berent solvent\ncontents. The dry mix is the composite with less solvent. The powder drying is carried\nout in a cement dryer at room temperature for a couple of minutes. The wet mix is the\ncomposite with more addition of solvent. In other words, the wet mix is Mix 1, but with\nan addition of 0.3% of solvent. The dry mix represents Mix 1, yet with 0.3% less solvent.\nCompared with mix 1 (reference), Mix 1 (wet) exhibits a softer behavior by reaching\na larger relative density at a given compaction pressure. On the contrary, Mix 1 (dry)\npresents a decrease of roughly 5% at the end of the loading, meaning a sti\u001ber behavior\nduring the compaction. This indicates that compaction behavior is drastically a\u001bected\nby this moisture content and the related binder viscosity.\nIn summary, composite powder compositions (Mix 1-4) are compacted up to a nominal\npressure of 35 MPa, replicating the industrial protocol. The samples obtained with this\nprocedure will be submitted to uniaxial compression tests (crush tests). The powder\ncomposite Mix 1 (reference) is used for closed-die compaction up to di\u001berent maximum\ncompaction pressures (10, 35, and 100 MPa). Those compacted compositions will be used\nfor triaxial compression tests (Fig. 3.13). In the following sections, those mechanical tests\n78\n\n3.7. Green mechanical testing\n\nFigure 3.12: a) Ageing e\u001bect: the compaction curve in grey (dashed) represents the\ncompaction of the old Mix 1.

This \u001cgure shows the\ndi\u001berences between the dry Mix 1 (less solvent content), wet Mix 1 (more solvent content)\ncompaction curves, and the Mix 1 reference.\n(uniaxial and triaxial compression) are described.\n\nFigure 3.13: Summary representation of the green characterization. Close die compaction\nexperiments are carried out and the compacted samples are used to uniaxial and triaxial\ncompression tests.\n\n3.7.2 Uniaxial compression test\nCylindrical green composite specimens (Mix 1-4) with a height of approximately 40 mm\n± 0.3 and diameter equal to 40 mm and compacted at 35 MPa are submitted to uniaxial\ncompression tests (crush tests). As presented before, the relative densities measured after\nthe unloading are approximately 95.7%, 89.9%, 96.5%, and 94.8% for Mix 1-4, respectively\n(Table 3.8).\nThe samples are compressed uniaxially until a failure force (P ) is reached. The uniaxial\ncompression strength (σc ) is:\nσc =\n\n4P\nπD2\n\n(3.5)\n79\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\nwhere D is the diameter of the sample in mm.\nIn other words, uniaxial compression strength (also known as green strength) is the\nmaximum axial compressive stress that a cylindrical sample of material can withstand\nbefore failing. The compressive green strength calculated for the powder composites (mix\n1 to 4) is presented in Table 3.9. As seen previously, only one close die compaction\nfor each composition was carried out. Thus, one compacted sample of each composite\ncomposition was conducted to uniaxial compression tests (a total of four samples). The\nstandard deviation may be evaluated from the experience of VESUVIUS on the same type\nof refractory composites, which is approximately 0.02 MPa ([Mazerat, 2014]).\nPowder composite Compression strength (MPa)\nMix 1\n3.85\nMix 2\n3.81\nMix 3\n4.52\nMix 4\n3.52\nTable 3.9: Compression green strength (MPa) of powder composites (mix 1 to 4). The\nsamples were compacted previously at 35 MPa and submitted to uniaxial compression\ntests. The standard deviation is typically around ± 0.02 MPa ([Mazerat, 2014]).\nThe failure surface of the samples after the tests is shown in Fig. 3.14. In general, the\nsamples exhibit cracks parallel to the load direction and a lateral deformation (sample\nswelling). The images show that Mix 2 and Mix 4 are the ones that visually present\nmore cracks. The binder is a ductile phase that cements the grains together. A lack of\nbinder (Mix 2) clearly makes the compacted composite more brittle. As for Mix 2, Mix\n4 incorporates also less binder compared with Mix 1 and has an excess of coarse alumina\nparticles. This last e\u001bect may play a role as a more continuous skeleton of coarse alumina\ngrains may form and degrade the ductility of the composite.\n\nFigure 3.14: Crack orientation of powder composites (mix 1 to 4) after uniaxial compression trials (crush tests). The samples were previously compacted to 35 MPa in a\nclosed-die. The relative density of the samples after the close-die compaction are between\napproximately 89% and 95%.\n80\n\n3.7. Green mechanical testing\n\nAlthough Mix 2 is more porous than Mix 4, Mix 4 presents somewhat smaller compression strength (Table 3.9). This could be related to an interplay between a larger amount of\ncoarse alumina particles and graphite, and to the smaller amount of \u001cne alumina particles\nfor Mix 4. Mix 3, the composite with more binder volume fraction, exhibits the highest\ncompression strength and is almost crack-free. In summary, the compression strength is\nmostly impacted by the binder and coarse alumina contents.\n\n3.7.3 Triaxial compression test\nThe triaxial compression test is an e\u001bective test to characterize the mechanical behavior\nof powder materials by controlling the shear and compressive stress components on the\nsample. Triaxial compression tests are performed on compacted Mix 1 cylindrical samples\n(30 mm diameter and approximately 36.6 mm ± 0.12 height), previously compacted to\nthree pressures (10, 35, and 100 MPa) in a close-die con\u001cguration (Fig. 3.11), for a better\nunderstanding of the composite yielding and fracture behavior after compaction (green).\nThe experimental setup, using an Instron machine device, is shown in Fig. 3.15.\n\nFigure 3.15: Experimental set-up developed for triaxial compression tests. The radial\npressure (or con\u001cning pressure) is applied by pumped oil. The samples axial strain are\nmeasured using an extensometer device.\nThe tests are performed at ambient temperature. The radial pressure, or con\u001cning\npressure, is applied by the oil pump, and the radial and axial pressure, σ1 , evolves together\nuntil a given set point (radial pressure target). Thus, only the con\u001cning pressure (σ2 = σ3 )\nis maintained constant, and only the axial pressure is increased. The entire cycle lasts\n81\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\napproximately 9 min. The sample axial strain is measured using an extensometer device\n(MFX). Di\u001berent con\u001cning pressures are employed to investigate stress-strain curves and\nto be compared and calibrated with numerical simulations. Triaxial compression tests\nare used to analyze the material when submitted to both shear and compressive stresses.\nThis method allows testing with di\u001berent loading paths to establish a complete material\ncharacterization [Pavier & Doremus, 1999].\nThe axial stress (σ1 ) evolution as a function of the axial strain of mix 1 is presented\nin Fig. 3.16. Three con\u001cning pressure (or radial stress) were applied in these tests,\nσ2 = σ3 = 10, 20, and 30 MPa. These curves show the same qualitative behavior with an\napproximately linear \u001crst part followed by a non-linear one. The \u001crst part corresponds to\nthe increase of the con\u001cning pressure to the set value (10, 20 or 30 MPa). This \u001crst part is\nterminated for strains smaller that 0.012 whatever the lateral pressure. This roughly linear\npart of the curve is represented by increasing the three stresses together (σ1 = σ2 = σ3 ).\nThe non-linearity is at above the con\u001cning pressure (σ2 = σ3 ). For example, when the\napplied radial stress is 10 MPa, the transition from the linear to the nonlinear part take\nplace at σ1 = 10 MPa.\nThe most porous samples (RD=85%) exhibit a more signi\u001ccant deformation to attain\nthe radial pressure of the curves. This deformation e\u001bect decreases with higher relative\ndensity samples. For instance, at RD=85%, the axial strain in stress-strain curves is below\napproximately 0.002-0.012 (for radial pressures of 10 MPa, and 30 MPa, respectively). At\nRD=95%, the axial strain varied between 0.003-0.009. And, at RD≈100%, the axial\nstrain is between 0.003 and 0.005. Samples with smaller RD are less sti\u001b because more\nporosity in the microstructure means more voids around the grains, so the grains have\nmore space to rearrange during the compaction, increasing the composite deformation for\na given stress. The binder may also a\u001bect the sample deformation because it can extrude\nmore easily when it \u001dows through larger spaces between grains.\nFig. 3.17 shows the samples damage pro\u001cle after triaxial compression tests performed\nat 10 MPa, 20 MPa, and 30 MPa radial con\u001cning pressure. The sample shrinks mostly in\nthe center with the increase of the con\u001cning pressure, showing a concave shape. Also, no\nvisible cracks could be observed, suggesting that the green samples are still very ductile\nbecause of the binder e\u001bect. In our composites, the stress at which the material yields\nis not easily detected. Note in Fig. 3.16 that the green composite does not show a clear\nyield either ultimate stress at any con\u001cning pressure.\nThe identi\u001ccation of the yield and ultimate (maximum) stresses are determined from\naxial stress-strain curves of triaxial compression tests. We then calculate the deviatoric\n(q = σ1 − σ3 ) and mean (p = (σ1 + σ2 + σ3 )/3) stresses. The yield stress is assumed as\nthe o\u001bset of the \u001crst linear part from stress-strain curves, and the ultimate stress as the\n82\n\n3.7.

EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\npoint in common between the two secants from the second curve part (Fig. 3.18 a).\nFig. 3.18 b) shows the deviatoric (q ) and mean stresses (p) (in MPa) from triaxial\ncompression tests based on the methodology applied in Fig. 3.18 a). The p vs. q (calculated from ultimate stresses) of samples at RD=95% and RD≈100% turn into a more\nconvex shape. Still, no conclusive informations on the shape of these yield and ultimate\nsurfaces could be taken from Fig. 3.18 b).\nNevertheless, it is probable that even if more triaxial tests were performed applying\nmore con\u001cning pressures, predicting the yield and ultimate stresses of green microstructures would remain a di\u001ecult task. This is because plastic yielding may arise very soon\nin these green granular composites and that the elastic core (the part of the stress space\ninside the yield surface) may be very small in all strictness.\n\nFigure 3.18: a) Methodology adapted to predicting the yield and ultimate stresses from\nstress-strain curves of triaxial compression tests on Mix 1. b) Deviatoric-mean stresses\n(calculated from yield and ultimate stresses).\n\n3.8 Sample preparation for thermal analysis and for\nring characterization\nAll samples for the thermal analysis and \u001cring characterization (mechanical tests and\nBrazilian tests) were produced from Vesuvius industrial test tubes. First, the powders\nare inserted inside a mold (Fig. 3.19 a), and compacted isostatically up to a nominal\npressure of approximately 35 MPa, cured, and \u001cred to 900°C, following the standard industrial procedure. After the manufacturing process, the test tubes were cut into several\ncylindrical samples (Fig. 3.19 b) to be tested in Thermo Gravimetric analysis (TGA),\ndilatometry, uniaxial and triaxial compression, and Brazilian (diametral) tests. The samples dimensions are dependent on the type of analysis and are described in the next\nsections.\n84\n\n3.9. Thermal analysis\n\nFigure 3.19: Test tube after \u001cring (cut into cylindrical samples).\n\n3.9 Thermal analysis\nTemperature-dependent experiments are performed on cured powder composite samples\nwith ThermoGravimetry analysis (TGA) (section 3.9.1) for investigating the pyrolysis of\nthe binder phase during the thermal treatment. Thermal expansion analysis (TEX), or\ndilatometry, are carried out on cured (Mix 3) samples and \u001cred samples (mix 1-4).\n\n3.9.1 Thermogravimetric analysis\nThermoGravimetric analysis (TGA) was measured by VESUVIUS technicians on aftercuring small cylindrical alumina-graphite powder composite (mix 1-4) samples. TGA was\nperformed under argon atmosphere up to 1450°C with a ramp-up to 5°C min-1 followed\nby a dwell at the maximum temperature for 8 h (Fig. 3.20 a). The objective of TGA is\nto measure the weight loss as a function of the composite composition.\nThe weight loss curves show 3 temperature ranges (Fig. 3.20 b). First, stability up to\n200°C corresponds to the curing temperature, followed by a steep weight loss that slows\ndown at 600-800°C. Finally, above 800°C, smaller weight loss is observed depending on\nthe mix composition. During the overall thermal cycle, the global weight loss for mix 1,\n2, 3, and 4 is 4.3%, 3.8%, 4.6%, and 4%, respectively (ascending order: mix 3 > mix 1\n> mix 4 > mix 2). The weight loss is increased with the binder content because of the\nbinder pyrolysis.\n[Dupuy, 2015] performed TGA analysis on cured alumina-graphite powder refractory\nsamples. The derivative curve (DTA) highlighted three peaks. The \u001crst one at around\n280°C, the second at 450°C, and the major weight loss occurred between 300°C and 800°C.\nBelow 400°C, weight loss can come from absorbed water and unreacted phenols [Costa\net al., 1997]. Above 800°C, the curve was relatively stable, indicating that the binder\npyrolysis was almost \u001cnished. Dupuy calculated a global weight loss equivalent to 4.3%,\n85\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\n\nFigure 3.20: Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) performed on powder composites (mix\n1 to 4). a) Temperature (°C) against the cycle time (in minutes) applied for all TGA\nanalysis. b) Measured weight loss (in %) against the temperature (°C) for mix 1 to 4.\n\nsimilar to the reference composite (Mix 1).\n\nFigure 3.21: Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) performed on a cured refractory composite [Dupuy, 2015].\n\n3.9.2 Dilatometry\nDilatometry is a technique of materials characterization that enables the measurement of\na material's thermal expansion and is able to study the evolution of a refractory during\n86\n\n3.9. Thermal analysis\n\nthe curing and/or \u001cring steps. Dilatometers are usually classi\u001ced into two categories: horizontal and vertical. Beyond the geometric aspect, the main di\u001berence between these two\ntypes of dilatometers is controlling the load applied to the sample. A vertical dilatometer\no\u001bers good control of the load throughout the thermal cycle. Since the contact pressure\ncan in\u001duence dilatometric results, a very low and constant load was applied throughout\nthe test [Schneider & Mong, 1957] [Wohlfahrt & Theska, 2014].\nThe TGA analysis was performed by VESUVIUS lab technicians using a horizontal\ndilatomer that allow larger samples increasing the precision of the expansion measurement.\nLikewise, in the case of a heterogeneous microstructure, the larger the sample, the more\nrepresentative of the material. Additionally, for the same measurement error on the\nlength variation ∆L, a larger sample allows a more precise measurement of the thermal\nexpansion.\nThe dilatometer used in the present study is a Netzsch DIL 402 C (Fig. 3.22). With\nthis device, it was possible to apply a force on the sample varying from 0.5 KPa-1.6\nKPa. The dilatometric measurements are carried out on cylindrical samples of 18.8 ± 0.1\nmm diameter and 24-26 ± 0.1 mm length under argon, with a 150 ml/min \u001dow rate. The\nthermal cycle corresponded to a heating up to 1050°C with a 5°C min−1 ramp, followed by\na cooling down at 10°C min−1 . The tests were performed in argon atmosphere carried out\nfor 20 min before the start of the test and throughout the thermal cycle. The coe\u001ecient\nof linear thermal expansion αLT (or CTE) is obtained from:\nαLT =\n\n∆L 1\nL0 T − T0\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere αL T [K −1 ] is the coe\u001ecient of linear thermal expansion (1/°C) at a temperature\nT (°C). L0 is the initial length [meters] at an initial temperature T0 (°C). ∆L is the change\nin length of the test specimen during heating or cooling in meters.\n\nFigure 3.22: a) Netzsch dilatometer device. b) Details of the heating/measuring unit,\nvacuum, and sample holder unit.\n87\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\nEvolution of cured materials thermal expansion during pyrolysis\nFirst, to understand the e\u001bect of the binder pyrolysis and the refractory composite\nbehavior after the curing step, the dilatometry was performed on cured (up to 200°C)\nrefractory composite (Mix 3). As shown in Fig. 3.23 a), the thermal strain can be divided\ninto four major steps; three during heating and one during cooling. The \u001crst step (1),\nranging from room temperature to 330 °C, can further be divided into 2 sub-steps: i)\nrepeat of the curing cycle <200 °C followed by ii) a stable linear behavior [Mottram et al.,\n1992]. Around 360 °C (step 2), this linearity is lost, and shrinkage is observed (the thermal\nstrain becomes negative as the resin is pyrolyzed accompanied by degassing and volume\nshrinkage [Trick & Saliba, 1995] [Costa et al., 1997].\n\nFigure 3.23: a) thermal expansion of cured mix 3 (during pyrolysis) versus temperature\nduring the heating (1-3) and cooling (4). b-1) and b-2) coe\u001ecient of thermal expansion\n(CTE) evolution against the temperature during the heating, and cooling, respectively.\nThis same step 2 can also be sub-divided into two parts (Fig. 3.23 b-1): from 330 °C\nto 500 °C (2 a), where the major shrinkage is observed, and from 500 °C to approximately\n700 °C (2 b), the CTE becomes more constant (still negative). In summary, the resin\npyrolysis continues and starts to transform into rigid pyrolytic carbon during the second\nstep. Indeed, the pyrolysis shrinkage is balanced by the alumina grains expansion but is\nstill in favor of binder shrinkage. In step 3 (Fig. 3.23 b-1), the grain expansion takes over,\nand the overall expansion becomes positive.\nThe expansion inversion between steps 2 and 3, at about 700 °C, causes the bell e\u001bect\n88\n\n3.9. Thermal analysis\n\nand marks the transition from a viscous shrinking binder phase to a rigid pyrolytic carbon.\nSince the pyrolytic carbon is sti\u001ber, the bonding phase can no longer follow the swelling of\nthe alumina particles. Thus, compressive radial and circumferential tensile stresses (that\nstarted at step 2 b), which happen at the interface, can cause radial micro-cracks within\nthe pyrolytic carbon [Ko et al., 2001]. This phenomenon occurs at two scales within the\ncomposite microstructure, \u001crst, at a lower scale within the bonding matrix (between the\npyrolytic carbon and \u001cne calcined alumina grains). In second, at a larger scale, between\nthe bonding matrix and the coarse alumina grains.\nFinally, during the cooling (step 4), the CTE stabilizes (Fig. 3.23 b-2), with a continuous shrinkage of the material. However, because the white fused alumina aggregates\nand \u001cne calcined alumina particles have a larger CTE than the pyrolytic carbon, they\nshrink more. Thus, assuming that at 900 °C, the interface between the alumina grains and\nthe carbon matrix is cohesive, decohesions occur during this stage because of the CTE\nmismatch, inducing to radial tensile stresses and circumferential compressive stresses in\nthe matrix phase [Nazaret et al., 2018]. Also, these decohesions (binder bell e\u001bect) occurs\nat two scales, within the matrix, between \u001cne calcined alumina particles and the pyrolytic\ncarbon, and between the matrix and the coarse alumina grains. It is worth noting that\nthis mechanism has been observed for carbon bonded refractories (chapter 2).\nEvolution of \u001cred materials thermal expansion\nOnce the material has been \u001cred, its dilatometric behavior is drastically di\u001berent (Fig.\n3.24 a). ∆L/L0 increases as the temperature rise, but this curve is not completely linear\nand is also not completely reversible during cooling. This can be \u001crst explained since the\nring is carried out at 900°C whereas the dilatometry analysis was performed at 1050°C.\nTherefore, at the 1000-1050°C the binder is pyrolyzed leading to a material non-reversible\nevolution. Also, the re-opening of microcracks and decohesions between coarse alumina\ngrains and matrix occurs, leading to a hysteresis phenomenon. Thus, in a composite\ncontaining larger binder volume fraction (Mix 3), the global shrinkage increases, a sign of\nplastic deformation which can originate from binder pyrolysis or microstructural damage.\nThe coe\u001ecient of thermal expansion (CTE) evolution with temperature is shown in\nFig. 3.24 b-1). The curves exhibit a division between 2 zones: \u001crst, the CTE is relatively\nstable below 750°C whereas it increases above this threshold temperature and tends to 8\nx 10−6 K −1 at 1000°C. In the \u001crst zone, the CTE attributed to the matrix is presented\nin Table 3.10. The CTE of the aluminum oxide (Al2 O3 ) is ≈ 6.5 · 10−6 and the carbon\nbonding matrix < 4 · 10−6 . Mix 3 show the lowest CTE (3.4 · 10−6 K −1 ) due to the lack\nof calcined alumina and higher binder content. In the opposite direction is mix 2, which\n89\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\n\nFigure 3.24: a) Thermal expansion of \u001cred (pyrolyzed materials) powder composites\n(mix 1 to 4) against the temperature during the heating and cooling, and b) coe\u001ecient of\nthermal expansion (CTE) evolution during the heating segment (b-1), and cooling (b-2)\nagainst the temperature.\n\npresents the highest value (5.5 · 10−6 K −1 ) because of lack of binder and higher calcined\nalumina volume fraction. Whereas both mix 1 and 4 are intermediate with 4.2-4.3 (x10−6\nK −1 ). This behavior can be explained since Mix 1 and Mix 4 have the same matrix\nvolume fraction %. Even if mix 4 has more volume fraction of coarse alumina grains, the\ngrains interlocking was not enough to drastically a\u001bect the thermal expansion coe\u001ecient.\nPowder composite αLT (or CTE) [10−6 K −1 ]\nMix 1\n4.3\nMix 2\n5.5\nMix 3\n3.4\nMix 4\n4.2\nTable 3.10: Average of the coe\u001ecient of thermal expansion (10−6 K −1 ) from the four\npowder composites (between 20-750°C).\nThe CTE of these powder composite samples during cooling is shown in Fig. 3.24\nb-2). Globally, the CTE increases as the \u001cne alumina content rises and the content of\nthe binder is reduced (Mix 2). Above 700°C, all the CTE are relatively high and similar\nto each other. Below 750°C, Mix 1 and Mix 4 still exhibit very intermediate similar\nbehavior. In contrast, the mix 2 material presents a lower decrease in CTE, because of\nthe percolation of the calcined alumina grains, occurring even at low temperature and\n90\n\n3.10. Mechanical testing on \u001cred samples\n\nleading to an increase of the CTE [Guillo et al., 2015].\n\n3.10 Mechanical testing on \u001cred samples\nThis section describes the mechanical characterization of \u001cred powder composite refractories. For this purpose, destructive tests were carried out, such as uniaxial compression,\nBrazilian (or diametral compression), and triaxial compression tests. Uniaxial and Brazilian tests are performed using di\u001berent testing temperatures.\n\n3.10.1 Uniaxial compression test\nUniaxial compression tests (or crush tests) are carried out on \u001cred Mix 1, isostatically\ncompacted at 35 MPa. The crush test consists of placing a cylindrical specimen (machined\nwith \u001dat and parallel ends) between two plates of a compression machine and loading it up\nto breakage (Fig. 3.25). The samples have 29 ± 0.06 mm diameter and 60.6 ± 0.05 mm\nheight. The mechanical tests are carried out at 0.3 mm/min speed until sample breakage,\nat room temperature (20°C), and at di\u001berent testing temperatures (300, 600, 900, and\n1200°C) using a steel inductor (Fig. 3.26). Each crush test is repeated with 4 di\u001berent\nsamples and the standard deviation is calculated.\nThe applied force and de\u001dection are measured by a METEC extensometer on the\nsamples and converted into stress and strain with the following relations:\n4P\nπD2\n\n(3.7)\n\nε = ∆L/L0\n\n(3.8)\n\nσ=\n\nwhere σ is the stress applied on the specimen (MPa), P is the load applied during the crush\ntest (N), A is the sample cross-section area (mm2 ). ε is the sample strain (mm/mm). ∆L\nis the sample height variation (mm). L0 is the initial gauge length of the extensometer\n(mm).\nThe mechanical behavior characteristics of each material are analyzed from the stressstrain curves, and the following mechanical parameters are determined: modulus of elasticity (MOE), yield stress (σy ), and ultimate stress (σc ) (compressive uniaxial strength).\nThe secant Young's modulus (or MOE) is determined at the linear part of the curve, and\nthe yield stress is determined at 0.02% strain (0.0002 mm/mm). The ultimate stress is\nconsidered as the maximum stress from stress-strain curves. The ratio σy /σc is assumed\nas a measure of the deviation from the linear part to the non-linear part of the curve.\n91\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\n\nFigure 3.25: a) Uniaxial compression test set-up. b) observed failure mode (shear failure)\nin mix 1 (reference powder composite) samples after uniaxial compression tests performed\nat ambient temperature (20°C).\n\nFigure 3.26: a) Uniaxial compression test set-up with heating. b) observed failure mode\n(shear failure) in mix 1 (reference powder composite) samples after uniaxial compression\ntests performed at 300, 600, and 900°C.\n\nIn other words, indicates the ability of the composite to experience plastic deformation\nbefore failure.\nThe axial stress evolution of Mix 1 vs. axial strain is exhibited in Fig. 3.27 a) as\nthe temperature increases. An important feature of these refractory materials is that the\nultimate stress is increasing with temperature. We observe a increase of material strength\n(ultimate stress) with the testing temperature, with a more signi\u001ccant increase above\n600°C. The strength is reached at 900°C and 1200°C. Overall, the composite ductility is\nhighly dependent on the temperature (ductility increases with the rise of the temperature).\nThis can also be con\u001crmed by Fig. 3.27 c) that highlights a decrease of σy /σc with the\n92\n\n3.10. Mechanical testing on \u001cred samples\n\nincrease of the testing temperature.\n\nFigure 3.27: Mix 1 uniaxial crush test trials performed at 20°C (ambient temperature),\n300°C, 600°C, 900°C, and 1200°C. a) axial stress (MPa) evolution with the axial strain\n(mm/mm). b) Ultimate and yield stresses points against the temperature (°C). c) Modulus\nof elasticity (Young's modulus) against the temperature (°C).\nFig 3.27 d) shows the e\u001bect of temperature on the MOE (Modulus of Elasticity). The\nMOE has been calculated from the slope between stress-strain curves, and exhibits quite\na large standard deviation at high temperature (>600°C). Thus, the evolution of MOE\nwith temperature should be taken with caution. Still, we can observe a decrease or at\nleast a plateau for MOE at high temperature. Such behavior has already been observed\nin the literature [Werner et al., 2013] [Werner et al., 2014]. Werner et al. suggests that\nthe increase in the e\u001bective Young's modulus with the temperature is a consequence of\nthe closure of gaps between the particles and the matrix, which is related to the thermal\nexpansion mismatch of the phases (graphite, alumina, and binder).\n\n3.10.2 Brazilian test (diametral compression)\nBrazilian test, or diametral compression, is an indirect tensile test that is performed to\ndetermine the quasi-static tensile strength of concrete materials [Carneiro, 1943] [Carneiro,\n93\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\n1953] [Fairbairn, 2002]. In this test, a compression load is applied vertically to the diameter\nof a cylindrical sample. The fracture occurs vertically because of tensile stresses induced\nhorizontally by the sample geometry (Fig. 3.28). The tests are performed in samples with\n39.69 ± 0.06 mm diameter and 35.39 ± 0.12 mm height that was previously compacted\nisostatically up to 35 MPa. Each Brazilian test is repeated with 7 di\u001berent samples, and\nthe standard deviation is calculated.\nThe Brazilian trial is carried out until specimen breakage. It allows determining the\nultimate tensile strength (σult ) via the following equation:\n2P\n(3.9)\nπDh\nwhere P is the load at sample breakage (N), D corresponds to the sample diameter (mm),\nand h is the sample height (mm).\nσult =\n\nFigure 3.28: a) Brazilian test set-up. b) observed failure modes in mix 1 (reference)\nsamples after uniaxial compression tests performed at 20°C, 300°C, and 900°C.\nThe evolution of the tensile strength (MPa) or ultimate stress against the testing\ntemperature (°C) (from 20°C to 1200°C) for mix1-4 composite compositions is presented\nin Fig. 3.29. In the present work, the sample strain was not measured. Usually is not\ncommon to evaluate elastic properties from Brazilian tests because the stress state within\nthe sample is not uniaxial. So, strain is usually not measured in such test [Belrhiti et al.,\n2017]. Overall, the compositions present an increase in the tensile strength from 20°C to\n1200°C, meaning that at higher temperatures, the materials become stronger, which is\ncoherent with what we have observed in Fig. 3.27 b) for uniaxial compression tests.\nThe brittle failure of ceramic materials is caused by randomly distributed defects in\nthe component. The defects occur in ceramic materials as a result of the manufacturing\nprocess. These defects can be described as microcracks in fracture mechanics in which\nsize and orientation are random. Therefore, the material strength is the stress at which\n94\n\n3.10. Mechanical testing on \u001cred samples\n\nFigure 3.29: Evolution of ultimate strength (MPa) against the temperature (°C) during\nBrazilian tests of mix 1-4.\n\nthe most critical microcracks start propagating and growing [Zielke et al., 2020]. These\nmicrocracks act as trigger loading to total failure. Based on the Weibull theory, the\nprobability of failure at given stress σ is:\n\u0014 \u0012 \u0013m \u0015\nσ\nPf (σ) = 1 − exp −\nσ0\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere σ0 is the strength of the material with a failure probability of 63.2%. m is the\nWeibull modulus which describes the scatter of the material strength and it corresponds\nto corresponds to the slope of the plot ln(− ln(1 − Pf )) versus ln(σult ).\nWeibull distribution plots are obtained for all the samples (7 total for each composition) and are presented in Fig. 3.30 a). Mix 4 and Mix 1 samples show the highest\nWeibull modulus (m), about 25.5 and 23.8 MPa, respectively, indicating a lower dispersion of tensile strength values (σult ). A lower value of Weibull modulus (m=17.4 MPa)\nwas obtained for mix 2, that is, the composite with less binder content, and consequently\nmore porosity (about 19.7%) against approximately 17% for mix 1, 3, and 4 (see previous\nTable 3.7). [Liu et al., 2016] investigated the Weibull modulus to evaluate the stability\nof carbon-bonded porous alumina ceramics strength through three-point bending tests.\nIt was observed that the increase of sample porosity resulted in a decrease of Weibull\nmodulus (m). Liu et al. have shown m values of 5.51-14.05 MPa.\nThe strength of Mix 1-4 samples with a failure probability of 63.2% (σ0 ) (Eq. (3.10))\nis shown in Fig. 3.30 b). It represents the evolution of σ0 against the testing temperature,\nthat varied from 20-1200°C. From 20-600°C, the reference composite (mix 1) is the one\nthat presented the highest σ0 . Mix 2, shows the lowest strength. At the \u001cring temperature (T=900°C), mix 1 shows a strength (σ0 ) declining followed by a strength recovery\n95\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\n\nFigure 3.30: a) Weibull plot of the test series regarding mix 1-4 (reference composite)\nat ambient temperature (20°C). b) strength of the material with a failure probability of\n63.2% for mix 1-4 at all testing temperatures (20-1200°C).\n\n(increase) above 900°C (T=1200°C). A reverse behavior was measured by [Zielke et al.,\n2020] on \u001cne-grained carbon-bonded alumina ceramic materials submitted to B3B-tests\nat di\u001berent testing temperatures. A composite material \u001cred at 800°C exhibited an increase of σ0 up to the \u001cring temperature (800°C) and a subsequent decrease in strength for\ntesting temperatures above the \u001cring temperature (T>800°C). The same composite but\nred at 1400°C shows a steady increase in strength (σ0 ) with increasing testing temperature. The maximum strength occurred when the testing temperature was equal to the\nring temperature. Mix 4 follows the [Zielke et al., 2020] behavior where the maximum\nstrength value was achieved at the \u001cring temperature (T=900°C) followed by a decrease\nat T=1200°C. Mix 2 and mix 3 highlighted a steady increase of σ0 with increasing testing\ntemperature.\nThe standard deviation in strength (σ0 ), changing with the testing temperature, and\nmix composition (mix 1-4) may be related to the microstructure pore size distributions\nand pore size [Werner et al., 2014] [Liu et al., 2016]. The pore size distribution may be\nassociated with the binder evaporation and void formation due to the thermal expansion\nmismatch between alumina, graphite, and the carbonaceous matrix. The cracks and voids\nformed during the cooling stage [Werner et al., 2013] [Luchini et al., 2018] also may a\u001bect\nthe microstructure strength.\nTo note, Weibull statistics are generally obtained with a larger amount of data points\nas compared to the plots shown in Fig. 3.30 (7 samples of each composition at each\ntesting temperature). Still, this plot allows the evaluation of the σ0 and m values even\nfor a smaller quantity of samples. This is an useful parameter in the industrial context\nbecause it allows obtaining the strength of industrial parts whose volume is di\u001berent from\nthe lab part.\n96\n\n3.10. Mechanical testing on \u001cred samples\n\n3.10.3 Triaxial compression test\nTriaxial compression tests were performed on \u001cred composites (mix 1 to 4) in 29 mm\ndiameter and 60 mm height samples, iso-pressed to 35 MPa. The trials were performed\nin the same Instron machine used for the green characterization (Fig. 3.15). Thus,\nde\u001cning σ1 , and (σ2 , σ3 ) as the axial and con\u001cning stresses, respectively, triaxial tests are\ncarried out to calculate the yield and ultimate stresses and consequently the deviatoric and\nmean stresses of \u001cred powder composites with the e\u001bect of the applied con\u001cning pressure\n(σ2 = σ3 ). A series of tests with increasing lateral pressure (σ2 = σ3 = 0 MPa, 2.5 MPa,\n5 MPa, 10 MPa, 20 MPa, 30 MPa, 60 MPa) were performed. For each test, the sample\nwas loaded in the pressure cell, loaded under hydrostatic pressure (σ1 = σ2 = σ3 ), coming\nfrom the oil, until the pre-set con\u001cning pressure is reached and maintained constant. The\naxial stress (σ1 ) is gradually increased until sample failure.\nA schematic representation of the three stresses (σ1 , σ2 , and σ3 ) applied to the sample\nduring triaxial tests is given in Fig. 3.31 together with samples failure surfaces after the\ntests by varying the con\u001cning pressure values (σ2 = σ3 ). From 0 to 5 MPa, the samples\nshow some thin microcracks in shear. Increasing the con\u001cning pressure, the samples\n(at higher pressure, >15 MPa) exhibit some clear fracture in shear in the center of the\ngeometry.\n\nFigure 3.31: a) representation of the three stresses (σ1 , σ2 , andσ3 ) during triaxial tests.\nσ1 is the axial stress, and σ2 , and σ3 are the con\u001cning pressure. b) Mix 1 specimens after\nfailure (fracture surfaces).\nPlots of axial stress (σ1 ) as a function of the axial strain for the di\u001berent con\u001cning\npressures used in the triaxial compression experiments are presented in Fig. 3.32 a) mix 1,\nb) mix 2, c) mix 3, and d) mix 4. The axial stress of the four composite powders increases\nsteadily with increasing con\u001cning pressure (σ2 = σ3 ). This is simply a consequence of the\nincreasing interlocking of individual particles with increasing compaction pressure [Zeuch\net al., 2001] [Mervyn S. Paterson, 2005]. The stress-strain curves show a typical ductile\nbehavior with a roughly linear segment followed by a smooth transition to a non-linear\n97\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\ncurve. This behavior agrees with stress-strain plots from triaxial compression tests using\naluminium silicate green materials [Bosi et al., 2014]. However, to our best knowledge,\nthis type of experiments has never applied on \u001cred carbon-bonded refractory composites.\n\nFigure 3.32: Axial stress, σ1 , evolution vs. axial strain (mm/mm) from triaxial tests\nperformed at several con\u001cning pressure (σ2 = σ3 ). These tests were carried on \u001cred mix\n1 to 4 powder composites (previously compacted to 35 MPa).\n\nFig. 3.33 is represented by the ultimate axial stress σ1 (ultimate) evolution with the\ncon\u001cning pressure. The ultimate stress is considered as the point in common between\nthe roughly linear curve with a strain o\u001bset equal to 0.02% and the secant of the second\nnon-linear curve. It can be seen that the ultimate axial stress increases with the con\u001cning\npressure, and it highlights a linear tendency (with a \u001ctting correlation coe\u001ecient equal to\nR2 = 0.99 for mix 1 plot). Mix 1, 3, and 4 exhibit a very similar behavior. Mix 2, which\nis the composite with a lack in binder content, exhibits a relatively smaller ultimate axial\nstress with values 10% (60 MPa) to 33% (0 MPa) smaller than the corresponding ones\nfor Mix 1.\n98\n\n3.10. Mechanical testing on \u001cred samples\n\nFigure 3.33: Ultimate axial stress, σ1ultimate , evolution with the con\u001cning pressure (σ2 =\nσ3 ) of powder composites (mix 1-4).\n\n3.10.4 Deviatoric and mean stresses\nVESUVIUS fundamental research applies the Bigoni, and Piccolroaz function to characterize \u001cred composites and to de\u001cne the materials model parameters for \u001cnite element\nmodelling (FEM) simulations. Thus, the main objective here was to estimate the yield\nlocus and the failure envelope (critical line) to be further compared with discrete element\nnumerical simulations (presented in chapter 5) of \u001cred carbon-bonded alumina composites (Mix 1-4) and to apply the model function on thermo-mechanical modelling through\nFEM (chapter 6). For this purpose, yield and ultimate stresses estimated from previous\ndestructive testing (uniaxial and triaxial compression, and Brazilian tests), were reported\nas functions of mean stress (P = − 31 (σ1 + σ2 + σ3 )), and deviatoric stress in module\n(Q = σ1 − σ3 ).\nThe P-Q yield and ultimate surfaces of the four powder composites (mix 1-4) were\nevaluated from Brazilian, uniaxial, and triaxial compressive tests and are shown in Fig.\n3.34 a), for the ultimate, and on b) for the yield surfaces. The \u001crst p-q point in the ultimate\n√\nsurface (Fig. 3.34 a) is represented by Brazilian tests where p=2 σ31 , and q= 13σ1 ([Martin\net al., 2000]). The other points correspond to triaxial compression tests at con\u001cning\npressure varying from 0 to 60 MPa. Note that the uniaxial compression (crush) tests at\n20°C and the triaxial tests at σ2 = σ3 =0 presented similar ultimate and yield deviatoric\nand mean stresses because these two tests have a similar stress state.\nThe evolution of the deviatoric and mean ultimate surfaces have almost a linear tendency. However, the yield stresses exhibit a convex shape and resemble the p-q shape from\nthe Bigoni and Piccolroaz function [Bigoni & Piccolroaz, 2004], which turns pertinent to\n99\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\nthe use of this model to characterize these \u001cred powder composites. In both P-Q surfaces\n(ultimate and yield), decreasing the binder content (Mix 2) leads to a strength material\ndecrease due to the relative density of the composite at the end of the compaction. Mix 1\nand mix 4 presented a very similar behavior for the yield surface. Mix 3 (higher relative\ndensity) is the one that exhibits the highest strength.\n\nFigure 3.34: Deviatoric (σd = σ1 − σ3 ) stress against mean stress (σm = (σ1 + σ2 + σ3 )/3)\ngenerated for the a) ultimate and b) yield surfaces.\n\n3.11 Conclusions\nThis chapter investigated the microstructure of a carbon-bonded powder composite refractory through SEM and X-ray tomography analysis. Four composites were studied\nwith distinct compositions (mix 1-4). Several experimental techniques on green (after\ncompaction), after-curing, and after-\u001cring samples were carried out. In general, the compaction behavior, mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties could be analyzed.\nThe composite microstructure is composed of white fused alumina (coarse grains) and\ngraphite, kept together by a reinforcing matrix consisting of calcined alumina (\u001cne alumina\ngrains) and a pyrolytic carbonaceous binder. The SEM analysis of \u001cred microstructures\nshowed that coarse alumina grains have irregular shapes. With CT analysis, graphite\nakes deformation and micro-cracks are observed in a green sample due to the pressing.\nPorosity was detected around coarse alumina grains and graphite due to the mismatch\ncoe\u001ecient thermal expansion between graphite, alumina, and the pyrolyzed binder. The\ncoarse alumina grains and graphite are detached from the surrounding matrix. These\nobservations are in agreement with [Schmitt et al., 2002] and [Werner et al., 2013].\nThe overall open porosity % in \u001cred samples is larger than in cured samples because\nof the binder evaporation and pyrolysis. Thus, some porosity is introduced in the mi100\n\n3.11. Conclusions\n\ncrostructure. The bulk density and porosity of the powder refractories are in agreement\nwith [Werner et al., 2014].\nThe binder is the component that mostly a\u001bects the compaction behavior of the compositions. The reinforcement (graphite and coarse grains) e\u001bect on the compaction behavior could not be clearly identi\u001ced, maybe because the grains interlocking did not occur.\nAn increase in the spring-back e\u001bect as a function of the binder content could be observed\nduring the unloading.\nRegarding uniaxial compression tests on green samples, the composite with more\nbinder content exhibited the highest green strength and was almost crack-free. The composite with more reinforcement phase presented the lowest green strength because most\nlikely of coarse grains interlocking, increasing the micro-stress at the contact.\nDuring triaxial compression tests, the axial stress-strain curves showed similar behavior on green samples previously compacted at three di\u001berent pressures. The curves\nexhibited a \u001crst roughly linear part followed by a non-linearity (axial stress continues to\ngrow, and only the radial stresses remain constant). The most porous samples presented\na larger deformation during the rough linear part of the curve, whereas this e\u001bect was\nreduced for denser samples. This could be explained because more porosity leads to more\nspace for grains rearrangement during the compaction.\nThe thermal expansion analysis on cured samples could be divided into three stages.\nUp to 360°C, the coe\u001ecient of thermal expansion becomes negative (binder pyrolysis),\ncausing material shrinkage. Until 700°C, the binder pyrolysis continues and starts to\ntransform into a rigid pyrolytic carbon. Above 700°C, the overall CTE becomes positive\nbecause the pyrolitic carbon becomes sti\u001ber and the thermal expansion of aluminum oxide\nbecomes predominant. Thus the matrix can no longer follow the increasing expansion of\nalumina grains, creating micro-cracks within the microstructure. These observations agree\nwith previous Vesuvius Ph.D. works [Dupuy, 2015] [Warchal, 2018].\nThe uniaxial compression on \u001cred samples show that the material softening increased\nwith the testing temperature. The Young's modulus signi\u001ccantly increased up to a testing\ntemperature equivalent to 600°C, because of the closure of gaps between the alumina\ngrains, graphite, and the matrix (which is related to the CTE mismatch between them).\nAt T >600°C, Young's modulus decreased due to the closure of the gaps during the binder\npyrolysis.\nThe Weibull approach was used to interpret the data from Brazilian tests. The Weibull\nmodulus (m) has been determined for our powder composites. This is an useful parameter\nin the industrial context because it allows obtaining the strength of industrial parts whose\nvolume is di\u001berent from the lab part. Mix 4 and Mix 1 are the composites that exhibited\nthe highest Weibull modulus, indicating a lower dispersion of the ultimate strength. Mix\n101\n\nCHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION\n2 (lack of binder content) has shown the lowest Weibull modulus that may be associated\nwith the higher porosity.\nThe deviatoric and mean stresses surfaces of the four \u001cred composites were estimated\nthrough uniaxial and triaxial compression tests and Brazilian tests. The yield surfaces\nlead to a convex shape likely similar to the Bigoni and Piccolroaz plasticity model [Bigoni\n& Piccolroaz, 2004]. Increasing the binder content leads to a strength material increase.\nFinally, given the complex mechanical behavior of such heterogeneous composite refractories, one may ask if these experimental observations can be correctly reproduced by\nnumerical simulations? In the next chapter 4, an original approach by discrete element\nmethod (DEM) is described to represent a composite made of coarse and \u001cne alumina\ngrains, graphite, and binder. The aim of using a numerical approach was to improve our\nknowledge of the behavior of a complex industrial composite material. In this respect, we\nwill need to represent each of these phases in the DEM and investigate the possibility of\nDEM approaching some of the experimental data presented here.\n\n102\n\nChapter 4\nDEM: model development and\ndescription\nAn original approach is presented in this chapter, which is based on the Discrete Element\nMethod (DEM) of composite powder ceramic materials for steel casting applications,\nadapted for the green (compaction) and after-\u001cring stages. In section 4.3, the contact\nlaws (The Hertzian and the microscopic bond models) that were implemented in this\nwork are described. From those contact laws, it is possible to compute a macroscopic\nstress tensor at the macroscopic scale of the entire numerical composite (section 4.4). The\ncomposite is represented by a mixture of particle clusters and single particles (section 4.5).\nWhile the \u001cne alumina is considered as single non-bonded spherical particles, the graphite\nake and coarse alumina are discretized as a set of spherical particles bonded together\n(particle clusters). The graphite particles bonds may fracture during the compaction,\nexcept for the coarse alumina particles since those bond interactions are not considered\nin the calculations. The binder is not modeled as a particulate component. Instead, it is\nmodeled as an elastic soft-shell covering alumina material, however uniquely at the green\nstage. The preparation of the numerical composite follows two initial steps: i) the gas of\nparticles and ii) the jamming. At the \u001cnal of the jamming, the composite is at a relative\ndensity of 0.6 (section 4.6). The 'jammed' packing is compacted and unloaded. The\nunloaded samples are submitted to a series of triaxial compression and tensile simulations\n(section 4.7). Isostatic and closed-die compaction simulations are carried out on packings\ncontaining a di\u001berent number of particles to determine the minimum number necessary\nto tend towards an isotropic response and converge onto a constant pressure.

DEM: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION\n\n4.2 Introduction\nThis chapter presents an original approach for modeling a powder composite made of\ngraphite, alumina (\u001cne and coarse particles), and binder. The objective of using a numerical method was to improve knowledge on the behaviour of a very heterogeneous and\ncomplex industrial composite material. The simulations were focused on analyzing the\ncontribution of each phase to the composite compaction response. The \u001crst insight was\nthat the increase of the volume fraction of hard phases (alumina and graphite) a\u001bected\nthe composite relative density. Therefore, increasing the hard phase volume fraction decreases the attainable relative density for a given applied pressure. However, since coarse\nalumina grains and graphite \u001dakes are coated by a soft carbonaceous matrix (mixture of\nne alumina particles and binder), this simplistic assumption needs further investigation.\nIndeed, the identi\u001ccation of constitutive models of refractory composites for compaction\nand casting applications, based on numerical simulations, is an alternative way to reduce\nthe cost of the experimental method itself.\nConsequently, a model based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used within\nthe in-house code dp3D [Martin, 2003] and is performed to characterize the composites\nmacroscopic behavior at the green and after-\u001cring stages. DEM is a powerful tool to\nsimulate the behaviour of a representative volume element of a particulate medium. In\nthis method, each particle moves according to the fundamental principle of mechanics,\nand it interacts with neighbors through appropriate contact laws. DEM was used to represent each phase correctly and yet, su\u001eciently simple to run simulations in a reasonable\namount of CPU time. The four composites have distinct compositions, which a\u001bect their\ndensi\u001ccation response during the compaction. For this reason, the \u001crst question needs\nto be answered. Is it possible to reproduce qualitatively or quantitatively the composites\nmechanical behaviour di\u001berences?\nFor this purpose, the composite is modeled as a mixture of particle clusters and single\nparticles. Both coarse alumina and graphite are considered assemblies of particles bonded\ntogether (clusters). The \u001cne alumina is represented by single non-bonded particles. The\ngraphite particle bonds may fracture during the compaction, and the pellets can deform.\nOn the contrary, the coarse alumina bonded particles cannot break. The binder material is\nnot characterized as a discrete element and presents some peculiarities at the contact. This\nlast is modeled as a soft elastic shell surrounding coarse alumina clusters and \u001cne alumina\nparticles. Speci\u001cc contact laws (Hertzian and microscopic bond models) are employed to\nmodel these material phases separately. When two coated particles (\u001cne alumina particle\nor/and coarse alumina cluster) or a coated and non-coated particles indent each other,\nthe contact's elastic behavior will depend on two di\u001berent conditions. First, when the\n106\n\n4.3. Modeling particulate and continuous materials with DEM\n\ninteraction is limited to this soft binder shell. Second, once the critical indentation is\nreached, hard alumina contacts appear. If the contact at the second condition is failed\n(unloaded), some hysteresis is introduced at the unloading.\nFollowing the compaction and unloading simulations, the numerical \u001cred composite\nis modeled by ascribing bonds to all particles in contact to mimic the cohesion between\nparticles during the \u001cring. As the binder is pyrolyzed during the \u001crst stages of the \u001cring,\nthe matrix is represented by \u001cne alumina particles linked by elastic bonds. In sequence, to\nrepresent the binder bell-e\u001bect revealed from X-ray tomography images (chapter 3), pairs\nof bonds are broken between \u001cne alumina particles and between \u001cne alumina-graphite\nparticles.\nIn summary, the present chapter focuses on developing and validating an original approach based on DEM simulations to represent composite materials made of four distinct\nentities (\u001cne alumina, coarse alumina, graphite, and a soft binder at the green stage). The\nDEM contact laws used in this work are \u001crst described for particulate and then applied for\na composite approach. The volume fraction of each constituent is calculated based on the\ncomposites recipe. The mechanical representation for a green and a virtual \u001cred sample\nis also carefully optimized to represent a carbon-bonded alumina refractory material for\nsteel casting applications.\n\n4.3 Modeling particulate and continuous materials with\nDEM\nThis section describes the implementation of the principal contact laws used in this work:\n1 - The Hertzian contact law (section 4.3.1), and 2 - The microscopic bond model (section\n4.3.2). The non-bonded contacts were considered to behave elastically, and the bonded\nparticles may fracture.\nThe graphite \u001dakes and coarse alumina materials are represented as particle clusters.\nIndeed, the clusters are considered assemblies of single spherical particles. For each cluster,\nthe single particles are bonded together. However, the \u001cne alumina particles are modeled\nas a set of single spheres with no bonds to represent a more granular macroscopic behavior,\ncharacteristic of green materials. In DEM, di\u001berent types of elastic particle contacts were\nused. First, contact between non-bonded particles (by the Hertzian model), see Fig. 4.1\na). Second, contact between bonded particles (Fig. 4.1 b). These bonds may not fracture\nduring the numerical simulations (Fig. 4.1 b-1), or (Fig. 4.1 b-2) fracture. A fractured\nbonded contact may after be restored [Balakrishnan et al., 2010].\n107\n\nCHAPTER 4. DEM: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION\n\nFigure 4.1: Two particles contact is possible: (a) Hertzian (or elastic) contact between\nnon-bonded particles, and (b) elastic contact between bonded particles. (b-1) These bonds\nmay not break (non-fractured bonds) or (b-2) fracture. These fractured bonds may be\nrestored (new contact may appear between particles initially broken).\n\n4.3.1 Hertzian contact law\nThe Hertzian law illustrates the normal force at the contact between two particles with\nelastic properties, together with the Derjaguin Muller and Toporov (DMT) adhesion theory, initially pioneered by Derjaguin et al. [1975], which adds a tensile force to the standard\nrepulsive Hertzian force. [Martin & Bordia, 2008] also applied the DMT and JohnsonKendall-Roberts (JKR) [K. L. Johnson, K. Kendall, 1971] adhesion model to study the\ne\u001bect of adhesion and friction parameters on the geometry of monosized packings of\nspheres. [Martin, 2003] also used the DMT theory, however, to evaluate the powder\nspring back through unloading simulations of an agglomerate made of perfectly plastic\nspherical particles. [Barthel, 2008] wrote a paper review with methods developed in the\npast decades concerning adhesive interactions (and contact models, such as DMT and\nJKR) for elastic contact problems.\nThe normal force acting between two non-bonded particles with a radii (ri and rj ),\nand elastic properties (Ei , νi ) and (Ej , νj ), respectively, (n and t as unit normal and tangential vectors), is given by the Hertzian law 1 (Fig. 4.2)[Johnson, 1987]:\n\n4\nN Hertz = E ∗ R∗ 1/2 δn3/2\n3\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe e\u001bective Young's modulus between these two particles in contact is:\n∗\n\nE =\n\n\u0012\n\n1 − νi2 1 − νj2\n+\nEi\nEj\n\n\u0013−1\n\nThe equivalent radius R∗ is:\n1\n\nFor convention, the tensile and compressive forces are negative, and positive, respectively.\n\n108\n\n(4.2)\n\n4.3.

The Derjaguin, Muller, and Toporov (DMT) adhesion theory\n\n[Derjaguin et al., 1975] describes the elastic contact with adhesion between two spheres,\nunder the action of a normal force (Ne ) [Martin et al., 2006a] [Barthel, 2008].\n4\nNe = N Hertz + N DM T = E ∗ R∗1/2 δn3/2 − 2πωR∗\n3\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhile N DM T and N Hertz are the adhesive and repulsive forces, respectively, and ω the\nwork of adhesion (ω = 2γ , γ is the surface energy). Decohesion occurs in the DMT model\nfor a pull-o\u001b force N DM T = 2πωR∗ .\nContacts may also transmit frictional force (Hertz\u0015Mindlin model) in the sticking mode\n(Eq. (4.5)) while the tangential force is limited during sliding (Eq. (4.6)) by Coulomb\nfriction (friction coe\u001ecient μ) [Martin & Bordia, 2008]:\nT = −8G∗ · aδt if 8G · aδt < μN Hertz\n\nT =−\n\nδt\nμN Hertz if 8G∗ · aδt ≥ μN Hertz\n|δt |\n\n(4.5)\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere G∗ is the equivalent shear modulus and δt the accumulated tangential displacement\nat the contact location. Note that the condition for slip (Eq. (4.6)) applies on the repulsive\npart of the normal force (N Hertz ) and not on the total force Ne .\n109\n\nCHAPTER 4. DEM: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION\n\nFigure 4.3: Bond representation between two spherical particles p and q transmitting\nnormal and tangential forces, and resisting moments.\n\n4.3.2 Microscopic bond model\nFor bonded particles, the contact law is given by the analysis of [Je\u001berson et al., 2002]\nwho studied the elastic response of bonded contact by the \u001cnite element method. Two\nspherical particles p and q with radii rp and rq , respectively, connected to each other\nthrough bonds, transmit normal and tangential forces, and resisting moments (Fig. 4.3).\nThe normal contact force (Nb ) for a bonded contact is given by:\nNb =\n\n2ER∗\nfN (a∗ , Ψ)a∗ uN\n1 − ν2\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere E and ν are the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the particles, fN (a∗ , Ψ)\nab\nis a function that depends on the relative radius of the bond (a∗ = 2R\n∗ ), Ψ is a geometric\nfactor which allows for bond interaction to be considered, and uN is the accumulated\nnormal displacement at the contact. The normal force can be either in compression\n(uN > 0) or in tension (uN < 0). The tangential contact force (Tb ) is written as:\nTb =\n\n4ER∗\nfT (a∗ )a∗ uT\n(2 − ν)(1 + ν)\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere the function fT (a∗ ) depends on the bond size a∗ , and, uT is the accumulated\ntangential displacement at the contact. fN and fT values vary typically in between 1 and\n2. For more details concerning the form of fN (a∗ , Ψ) and fT (a∗ ) used in this work, see\n[Je\u001berson et al., 2002] [Martin et al., 2006a] [Pizette et al., 2013].\nThe maximum stress in tension (σN ) and in shear (σT ), transmitted by this cylindrical\nbond of radius ab , can be evaluated by using the Potyondy's model [Potyondy & Cundall,\n2004]:\nσN =\n\n110\n\nNb\n|MT |\n−\n4\nπab 2\nπab 3\n\n(4.9)\n\n4.4. Macroscopic stress calculation\n\nσT =\n\nTb\n|MN |\n+2\n2\nπab\nπab 3\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere MN and MT are the bonds resisting moments in the normal and tangential directions, respectively:\nMN = −\n\n8ER∗ 3\nfT (a∗ )θN\n(2 − ν)(1 + ν)\n\n(4.11)\n\n2ER∗ 3\nfN (a∗ , Ψ)θT\n(1 − ν 2 )\n\n(4.12)\n\nMT = −\n\nwhere R∗ is the equivalent radius at the bond between these two spherical particles, and\nθN and θT are the accumulated relative rotations in the normal and tangential directions,\nrespectively.\nRegarding the failure criteria applied in our work at a bonded contact, Eqs. (4.9) and\n(4.10) give at each time step an evaluation of the stress in tension and shear acting on the\nbond, σN and σT , respectively. If one of these stresses is above the tension strength (ΣN )\nand shear strength (ΣT ), input parameters in dp3D, the bond is considered as broken (in\nshort, if -σN > ΣN , or if σT > ΣT ). In our case, the only tensile force (if the particles\nfurther separate) that remains is the one given by the N DM T term from Eq. (4.4). An\nadhesive surface energy was used as an input parameter for the compaction simulations.\nA fractured bond may transmit a shear force according to a Hertz-Mindlin friction law\n(Eq. (4.8)). Correspondingly, a fractured bond in shear continues to transmit a resisting\nmoment in the tangential direction but none in the normal direction.\n\n4.4 Macroscopic stress calculation\nOnce the above described contact laws are implemented in dp3D, it is possible to compute\na macroscopic stress tensor at the scale of the entire packing. This is simply carried\nout in periodic conditions by considering the total contact force at each contact (N+T)\nand the branch vector connecting the centers of the two particles p and q in contact\n(lp,q ). The macroscopic stress tensor is calculated from Love's formulation [Weber, 1966]\n[Christo\u001bersen, 1981]:\nσij =\n\n1 X\n(Ni + Ti )lpq,j\nV contacts\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhere the summation is correlated to all contacts transmitting forces in the packing and\nwhere V is the sample volume (when in periodic conditions, V is the volume of the periodic\ncell), Ni and Ti are the ith components of the normal and tangential contact forces at the\n111\n\nCHAPTER 4. DEM: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION\ncontact, respectively. lpq,j is the j th component of the lpq branch vector.\nLikewise, when modeling a composite material in dp3D made of a mixture of distinct\nmaterials (e.g., materials 1, 2, and 3 ), it is also possible to calculate the macroscopic\nstress contribution of these materials separately. Thus, similarly to Eq. (4.13) above, the\ntotal stresses associated to material 1, e.g., are:\nσij,mat1 =\n\nX\n1\n1\n(Ni + Ti )(rp − δn )nj\nV contacts,mat1\n2\n\n(4.14)\n\nwhere δn is the geometrical indentation between the two particles at the contact, nj is the\nj th component of the normal vector n. And, rp is the particle radius (in this example, the\nradius of material 1 particles).\nNote that in Eq. (4.14), the sum is made on all contacts that includes a particle of\nmaterial 1, i.e., contacts between mat 1-1, 1-2, and 1-3.\n\n4.5 Composite materials approach\nThis chapter describes the use of composite materials by mixing particle clusters with\nsingle particles. The di\u001berences in the mechanical behavior between a graphite \u001dake,\ncoarse alumina, and a \u001cne alumina particle and how these approaches impact the composite macro-mechanical behavior are discussed. In this work, graphite \u001dakes and coarse\nalumina are considered assemblies of particles (or particle clusters) linked by bonds. As\nopposed to the graphite, these coarse aluminas cannot present any internal deformation,\nand consequently, the bonds cannot fracture (section 4.5.1). The determination of the\nelastic input parameters used in the contact laws is discussed in section 4.5.2.\nIn Section 4.5.3, an original approach to represent coarse and \u001cne alumina grains\nembedded into a soft matrix was proposed. The binder is modeled as a soft core-shell\nmaterial surrounding coarse alumina (cluster) and \u001cne alumina particles. When two\ncoated or a coated and non-coated particles indent each other, three conditions are possible\nat the contact (soft-soft contact, soft-hard contact, and hard-hard contact).\nThis idea re\u001dects the concept originally developed in the framework of homogenization\nby Hashin [Hashin, 1964]. Hashin proposed a composite sphere model by using graded\nspherical particles that are embedded in a continuous matrix (Fig 4.4), and the geometry of\nthese composite spheres are represented by a concentric shell. The aim was to investigate\nthe macroscopic mechanical behavior of heterogeneous viscoelastic media in dilatation and\nshear. Also, [Gernandt et al., 2011] modeled core/shell hydrogel particles by assigning\ndi\u001berent water solubilities to the core and shell domains of the particle.\nHowever, unlike Hashins' model, our model focus on the behavior of contacts between\n112\n\n4.5. Composite materials approach\n\nFigure 4.4: Composite spheres model proposed by Hashin ([You & Buttlar, 2004]).\nparticles, and the matrix is not represented by a viscous material but by a soft elastic\nbehavior (no viscosity). Our approach could be easily extended to composite applications\nand characterize complex microstructures in a simpler way.\n\n4.5.1 Bonded particles representation\nSeeking for simplicity, we have chosen to represent coarse alumina particles as spherical in\nDEM. However, this is considered an oversimpli\u001ccation since these particles have a very\nirregular shape, and exhibit size distribution (250μm average size). Concerning graphite\nakes, they tend to have rectangular and an elongated geometry (< 400μm size). In DEM,\nall alumina particle clusters have an equal diameter of approximately 130μm (a total of\n4,645 single particles with 7.8μm diameter each). The graphite \u001dakes are represented by\na parallelepipedic shape with dimensions of (121 x 116 x 17)μm with a total of 1,070\nsingle particles with 7.8μm diameter each. All particles in DEM were considered to have\na unique size (7.8μm).\nThe graphite \u001dakes present an elastoplastic behavior, and so, they deform during the\nsimulations (particles bond may break, thus bringing some plasticity at the macroscopic\nscale). The particles breakage are at the origin that some compaction microcracks are\nobserved with X-ray tomography (chapter 3). The graphite cluster is an assembly of\nsingle spherical particles (or particles cluster) linked through elastic bonds. The coarse\nalumina is also considered a cluster. However, the coarse alumina bonds cannot fracture,\ncontrasting with graphite. In Fig. 4.5, the bond interactions representation between\ncoarse alumina and graphite clusters are highlighted. Even if a coarse alumina cluster\ncontains particles linked by bonds, these bond interactions are not taken into account\nduring DEM simulations (Fig. 4.5 a).\nIn Fig. 4.5 b), the bond interactions inside the graphite \u001dake are calculated by the bond\ncontact model (Eqs. (4.7) and (4.8)). The graphite is denominated as a cluster. In Fig.\n113\n\nCHAPTER 4. DEM: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION\n\nFigure 4.5: Bonds interaction representation between particles clusters (coarse alumina\nand graphite \u001dake): a) the bond interactions inside the coarse alumina are not taken\ninto account; b) the bond interactions inside the graphite are calculated and are given\nby the bond contact model; c) the interactions between two coarse aluminas are given\nby the Hertzian contact model (no bonds); d) the interactions between coarse alumina\nand graphite materials are given by the Hertzian contact model; e) the Hertzian contact\nmodel describes the interactions between two graphite.\n\n4.5 c), the interactions between two coarse aluminas are described by the Hertzian model\n(Eq. (4.1)), for a contact between non-bonded particles. In Fig. 4.5 d), the interactions\nbetween coarse alumina and graphite are also given by the Hertzian contact model. In\nFig. 4.5 e), the interactions between two graphite \u001dakes are given by the Hertzian contact\nmodel, and inside the graphite, the bond interactions follow the bond model. The DEM\nmodel (if single particle or particle cluster) applied to each coarse alumina, \u001cne alumina,\nand graphite, and the external and internal interaction contact models are summarized\nin Table 4.1.\nThe bond representation of the ceramic composite in DEM is shown in Fig. 4.6. In\nsummary, the \u001cne alumina particles are considered a set of single non-bonded particles,\nand the clusters are particle assemblies linked by internal elastic bonds. Also, to represent\na more realistic raw material microstructure, the clusters (coarse alumina and graphite\nake materials) are considered fully dense (density RD = 1). Thus, it was imposed an\nindentation between internal cluster particles such as that the macroscopic relative density\nof the cluster is equivalent to 1. This indentation is of the order of 0.29R, where R is the\nsphere radius.\n114\n\n4.5. Composite materials approach\n\nFigure 4.6: Typical discrete microstructure after compaction: from blue (no bonds) to\nred (with bonds). Coarse alumina and graphite \u001dakes are considered as an assembly of\nparticles linked by bonds, and \u001cne aluminas as single non-bonded particles. Note how\ngraphite \u001dakes may deform while coarse alumina particles cannot.\nComposite unit\nDEM model\nExternal interactions\nInternal interactions\nFine alumina\nsingle particle\nHertz (Eq.

Regarding the coarse alumina, [Dupuy, 2015] performed nanoindentation experiments on brown fused alumina (similar to the coarse alumina used in our\nwork) to measure its Young's modulus, and it corresponded to 383 (± 8) GPa. Moreover,\nalumina exhibits a high Young's modulus of approximately 390 GPa, according to [Ashby\n& Jones, 2012], which is very similar to the value measured by [Dupuy2015]. Therefore, we\nconsidered in the DEM modeling that each single alumina particle exhibit Young's modulus of E =380 GPa, and for simpli\u001ccation, each particle that composes coarse alumina\nclusters also has E =380 GPa (Table 4.2).\nThe powder composites studied in this work have a carbonaceous binder in their\nmicrostructure, i.e., a mixture of phenolic resin and solvent (chapter 3). [Dupuy, 2015]\nmeasured Young's modulus of an equivalent reticulated binder (after the curing at 200°C)\nby nanoindentation (7.4 ± 0.1 GPa). Due to their large use, a wide range of elastic\n115\n\nCHAPTER 4. DEM: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION\nparameters for phenolic resins can be found in the literature. They were determined by:\nmolecular dynamics simulations\nThe Young's modulus of graphite was also estimated from the literature data. However, because the graphite material is very anisotropic, and depending on the crystallographic axes (that de\u001cnes its orientation), the Young's modulus can vary, for example,\nfrom 36 to 1060 GPa [Pierson, 1993]. According to measurements from [Dupuy, 2015],\nthe graphite has a Young's modulus of 35 GPa. Therefore, in DEM, we considered that\nevery particle belonging to graphite clusters has Young's modulus equal to 35 GPa.\nIn the literature, the Poisson's ratio for alumina can range from 0.34 to 0.37 (according\nto [Monk et al., 2015] and [Izumi et al., 2018]). For the graphite \u001dakes and the binder,\nit is much more di\u001ecult to ascertain a precise value. However, Eqs. (4.2) (elastic contact model), (4.7) and (4.8) (bond contact model), indicate that the terms involving the\nPoisson's ratio are on the form of 1 − ν 2 . The in\u001duence of the Poisson's ratio is minimal\nfor contact laws. In DEM, the Poisson's ratio for all materials (alumina, graphite, and\nbinder), almost negligible, were set to 0.2 (Table 4.2).\nMaterial\nE (GPa) [Eq. (4.1)] ν [Eq.

The experimental \u001cndings suggest division into two scales. First, a mesoscale\nwith a mixture between coarse alumina (250μm) and graphite (<400μm) embedded into\nthe matrix (i.e., a mixture of \u001cne alumina particles and binder). Second, a microscale by\nmixture of \u001cne alumina grains (<50μm) embedded into the binder (micro-scale). Knowing that coarse alumina grains and graphite are embedded into a matrix composed of \u001cne\nalumina grains and binder, we implemented an original approach by modeling an elastic\nsoft binder shell (with a determined thickness t, surrounding hard alumina particles). A\ngeneralization of the Hertzian contact law, that exhibits two di\u001berent rigidities depending\non the indentation between two particles, was proposed. This model applies at the surface\nof coarse alumina clusters. The bond interactions inside a coarse alumina cluster are not\n116\n\n4.5. Composite materials approach\n\ncalculated (section 4.5.1). Also, only particles at the their surface will be impacted by\nthe soft binder shell model.\nWhen two coated materials (e.g., \u001cne alumina particle or/and coarse alumina cluster)\nwith a radius ri and rj , elastic properties (Ei , νi ) and (Ej , νj ), surrounded by a binder\nshell with thickness ti = δc × ri and tj = δc × rj , and Young's modulus (Ebinder ), indent\neach other, the Young's modulus (Eq. (4.1)) depends on the mutual indentation and the\nthickness of the binder. δc is the critical indentation. Fig. 4.7 graphically summarizes the\nbinder model in the case of two coated particles (\u001cne or coarse alumina), and Fig. 4.8 the\ncontact between a coated particle and a non-coated particle (e.g., graphite), during the\ncompaction.\nWhen these two particles are in contact (the distance between the two centers is less\nthan ri + rj , two conditions may apply. First, if:\nδn ≤ δc = ti + tj\n\n(4.15)\n\nthus, the two particles in contact are at the binder soft phase branch 1 (Fig. 4.7 a) during\nthe \u001crst stage of the compaction (loading). The elastic modulus of the hard alumina\nparticles i and j is equivalent to the Young's modulus of the binder (Ei = Ebinder , Ej =\nEbinder ). Following the loading, during the unloading, the contacts at branch 1 follow the\nsame last path developed by the loading. The Hertz contact force at branch 1 (soft phase)\nis:\n4\nN Hertz = E ∗ R∗ 1/2 δn3/2\n3\n\n(4.16)\n\nSecond, if the indentation goes further and reaches the critical indentation:\nδn ≥ δc = ti + tj\n\n(4.17)\n\nthus, condition 2 applies, and the two particles interact directly through the hard alumina\nphase (branch 2). The elastic modulus of particles i and j are multiplied by a factor (M ).\nThe Hertz contact force at branch 2 (hard phase) is:\n4\nN Hertz = M E ∗ R∗ 1/2 δn3/2\n3\n\n(4.18)\n\nOnce the contacts are at the hard phase branch 2 (Fig. 4.7 b), during the \u001crst stage of\ncompaction (loading), they are at the critical indentation (δc ). In branch 2, the contacts\nmay face three possibilities. First, the normal force at the contact (N Hertz ) may continue\nincreasing during the compression (Fig. 4.7 b) i). When the contact is at the critical\nindentation, it may appear constant, but it is not. The critical indentation is much\nsmaller because the particle's Young's modulus is much larger at branch 2 than at branch\n117\n\nCHAPTER 4. DEM: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION\n1.\nSecond, the contact may unload (N Hertz decreases), (Fig. 4.7 ii). Third, the contact\nmay also fail (Fig. 4.7 iii). For the contact to fail, it needs to follow the condition:\n\u00012\nδn ≤ δc = (ti + tj ) 1 − M1 3 , and in that case no normal force is transmitted at the\ncontact. Following the compaction (during the unloading), the contacts at branch 2\nfollow the same last path developed by the compaction. Some contacts may present\ncompressive and tangential forces during the \u001crst stage of the compaction (loading). Some\ncontacts may also unload and fail during the unloading simulation and the compaction.\nWhen a contact at branch 2 fails (or is unloaded) during the compaction, hysteresis is\nintroduced at the particles' contact. This hysteresis does not occur when the contact is at\nbranch 1. Because of that, after the compaction (during the unloading), the macroscopic\nhysteresis of the composite will depend on the total number of indentation types (branch\n1 or 2) at the end of the compaction. Even if this is a simple condition applied for\nthe unloading, this model still allows us to model the most important aspect of the\nbinder shell; upon indentation, the rigidity of the contact evolves steeply when a critical\nindentation is reached.\nThe application of the binder model when a non-coated material particle (graphite)\nwith a radius rk and a coated material particle (\u001cne alumina or coarse alumina), with\na radius ri , elastic properties (Ek , νk ) and (Ei , νi ), respectively, indent each other, is\nshown in Fig. 4.8. This case is a particular case of Fig. 4.7 with tk = 0 (a null binder\nthickness).\nAt\ncondition 1 (soft contact), because the e\u001bective Young's modulus is E ∗ =\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1−ν 2\n1−νi2\n+ Ek k\nEi\n∗\n\n−1\n\n(Hertzian equation, Eq. (4.1)), and Ebinder << Ek the e\u001bective Young's\n2\nmodulus (E ) is approximately E ∗ = Ebinder /(1 − νbinder\n).\n\n4.5.4 Binder thickness calculation\nThe binder shell thickness of each microstructure (Mix 1 to 4) is directly related to\ntheir composition, calculated from the volume fraction of each component (coarse and\nne alumina, graphite, and binder), i, j , and k represent the coarse alumina, \u001cne alumina\nparticle, and graphite, respectively. All particles on DEM have the same radius equivalent\nto 3.9μm (including the \u001cne alumina) for two main reasons. First, this size (3.9μm) covers\nthe average size range of \u001cne alumina grains (<50μm) measured experimentally. Second,\nto reduce the time simulation consuming. Until approximately 2 years ago, dp3D could\nnot handle simulations e\u001eciently with di\u001berent particle sizes (this was improved recently).\nThe coarse alumina cluster has around 67 μm radius, and the graphite \u001dake is represented\nby a parallelepiped with dimensions of 121x116x17 μm (Fig. 4.5). Each coarse alumina\nand graphite \u001dake cluster has a total of 4,645 and 1,070 particles, respectively.\nThe total binder volume fraction can be written as:\n118\n\n4.5. Composite materials approach\n\nFigure 4.7: Two elastic particles coated with thickness ti = δc × ri and tj = δc × rj . a) the\ncontacts remains within the soft elastic binder phase (branch 1). b) when the indentation\nreached a critical value (that remains constant) i.e., condition δn ≥ δc = ti + tj applies,\nthe elastic modulus of particles i and j are multiplied by a factor M and the contact\nenters branch 2. Once in branch 2, i) due to the compression, the normal force at the\ncontact may increase, or ii) the contact may unload, or iii) the contact may fails (if\n\u00012\nδn ≤ δc = (ti + tj ) 1 − M1 3 ) and transmits no normal force.\n\nVf (binder) = (Vbinder(i) + Vbinder(j) )/(Vi + Vj + Vk )\n\n(4.19)\n\nwhere Vbinder(i) , and Vbinder(j) are the binder volume surrounding the coarse alumina clusters and \u001cne alumina particles, respectively.

In this case\n('same binder thickness' assumption), the binder thickness of \u001cne and coarse alumina are\nconsidered equal (ti = tj ).\nAn alternative approach to the assumption described above (ti = tj ) is to assume\nthat the volume fraction of binder surrounding coarse and alumina particles are equal\n(V fi = V fj ). In that case, small alumina particles exhibit much smaller binder thickness\nthan coarse alumina particles.

Typical densi\u001ccation curves (macroscopic axial stress evolution\nagainst the packing relative density) of closed-die experiment, of the two distinct assumptions (ti = tj = t, and V fi = V fj ), are shown in Fig. 4.9.

In this assumption, we consider that the binder volume\nfraction in coarse and \u001cne alumina is the same.\nV fi = V fj is 93.5% and 95.9%, respectively. Thus, only a small di\u001berence in terms of\n\ndensity. However, both curves follow the same slope up to approximately 87%.

While the\n'same volume fraction' follows the same behavior of the experiment. This sti\u001ber behavior\nof (V fi = V fj ) above 87% is because the binder thickness of \u001cne alumina particles is\nsmaller, leading to more hard alumina-alumina contacts. The closest correspondence between DEM macroscopic behavior and experimental data suggests that the 'same binder\nthickness' assumption (ti = tj ) is better approaching the actual composite.\n\n122\n\n4.6.

Details concerning\nDEM compaction simulations are described in the next chapter 5.\n\n4.6 Microstructure generation\nA classical dynamic DEM, as introduced by [Cundall & Strack, 1979], is used in a quasistatic approach within the in-house code dp3D [Martin et al., 2003] [Martin & Bouvard,\n2004] to compute the equilibrium positions of particles at each time-step. Fig. 4.10\nsummarizes the typical procedure to prepare packings. The initial composite assembly\nis obtained by \u001crst randomly locating bonded particle clusters (graphite and coarse alumina) and non-bonded single particles (\u001cne alumina) in a parallelepipedic periodic cell\nwith (1x1x2) size ratio (Fig. 4.10 a). At this stage, there is no contact between these constituents (\u001cne alumina, coarse alumina, and graphite \u001dakes do not contact each other).\nSuppose a particle belonging to a coarse alumina happens to contact with an already\nexisting \u001cne alumina particle. In that case, another set of random coordinates is drawn\nuntil the particle cluster can be located inside the box without any contact.\nIn this \u001crst step, the particles are located inside the box until the \u001cnal packing relative\ndensity is equivalent to 0.4. In all subsequent simulations, periodic conditions are used.\nThe particles whose center is outside of the simulation box are translated to the opposite\nface as shown in Fig. 4.11. For example, a particle i that protrudes outside of the periodic\nwall through the left periodic face interacts with other particles in the opposite face as if\nan image of i was created outside of the periodic box on the right side.\nHereafter, by slowly moving the box walls inwards, the packing (RD=0.4) is subjected\nto isostatic densi\u001ccation with low macroscopic pressure (0.02 MPa) up to a relative density\n123\n\nCHAPTER 4.

At this step, also called\njamming, contact forces appear. However, only elastic interactions are considered (Eq.\n(4.1)), friction and adhesion between particles are disregarded. In summary, the jamming\nstage mimics the gradual rearrangement of particles in the die without any plasticity or\nbond breakage. The 'jammed' packing at RD=0.6 represents the mix in the die before\ncompaction.\n124\n\n4.7. Typical DEM simulation conditions\n\n4.7 Typical DEM simulation conditions\nAs stated above, all samples were generated by applying periodic boundary conditions\nand by imposing a su\u001eciently slow strain rate to ensure quasi-static equilibrium. The\nvalue of the imposed strain-rate is set at each time step, starting from a value of 10−5\nsec−1 (ε ̇z = −10−5 ), and considering the normalized kinetic energy per particle: [Agnolin\n& Roux, 2007]\nẼkin =\n\nEkin\nn max(N R)\n\n(4.27)\n\nwhere Ekin is the total kinetic energy of the particle system, n the number of particles,\nN the normal force, and R is the particle radius.\nFig. 4.12 shows the evolution of the normalized kinetic energy against the relative\ndensity (RD) during a closed-die compaction simulation (chapter 5). The strain-rate and\nthe re-normalized mass of particles are adapted so that Ẽkin remains below 10−7 in the\nmajor part of the simulation (0.65 ≤ RD ≤ 1) (Fig. 4.12). At RD=0.6, the normalized\nkinetic energy rises to approximately 3.5 · 10−6 because of the 'abrupt' introduction of\nadhesion to the compaction. During the jamming, the adhesion is set to zero (friction\nand adhesion between particles are disregarded). [Agnolin & Roux, 2007] have shown\nthat to ensure quasi-static conditions, the normalized kinetic energy value should stay\nbelow 10−7 . However, the experience in dp3D has shown that if it stays below 10−6 , the\nsimulation can still be considered as quasi-static.\n\nFigure 4.12: Typical DEM close-die compaction simulation performed in or work (chapter\n5): kinetic energy (in m·J) against the relative density (RD) with an axial stress limit\n(target: σz =35 MPa).\nAfter the microstructures generation (section 4.6), the \"jammed\" packing is at RD\n125\n\nCHAPTER 4. DEM: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION\n= 0.6 and represents the mix in the die before compaction. The compaction can be\ndone along two routes: by closed-die or isostatic compaction (Fig. 4.13 c). In closedie compaction, the packing is attained along the z direction by applying a compressive\nmacroscopic strain rate (ε ̇z < 0) in the z axis to the simulation box, and a null strain\nrate in the x and y axis. In isostatic compaction, an identical compressive strain rate is\nimposed on all axis x, y and z (ε ̇x = ε ̇y = ε ̇z < 0). Small time-steps are considered in all\nsimulations to ensure numerical stability. The \u001cnal density during compaction simulations\nvaried between 0.6 < RD ≤ 1 by imposing stress or relative density targets.\n\nFigure 4.13: DEM simulations steps performed in this work: a) Particles/aggregates are\nrandomly located inside a box with periodic conditions up to a density RD = 0.4. b) the\npacking is densi\u001ced until RD = 0.6. c) close-die or isostatic compaction following various\nnal target densities d) the compacted sample is unloaded to 1 MPa pressure e) Triaxial\nand tensile test simulations.\n\nAt the end of the compaction, the packing, densi\u001ced up to a given density, is under\ncompressive stresses. The compacted samples are unloaded to obtain a macroscopic stress\nstate with nearly zero compressive stress (Fig. 4.13 d). During unloading, starting initially\nfrom an isostatic strain rate conditions (ε ̇x = ε ̇y = ε ̇z > 0), the strain rates are modi\u001ced\nso that the macroscopic stress state becomes isostatic (σx = σy = σz ), see Fig. 4.14. The\nunloading is stopped when the pressure (P = −1/3(σx + σy + σz )) is equal to 1 MPa.\nFig. 4.15 shows the local density of each particle during the three steps: jamming,\nclose-die compaction, and unloading. The particle clusters (coarse alumina and graphite),\n126\n\n4.7. Typical DEM simulation conditions\n\nFigure 4.14: Typical DEM unloading simulation in our work: macroscopic isostatic stress\nstate (σx = σy = σz ).\ndue to the indentation between the internal particle clusters in DEM (section 4.5.1), are\nfully dense (density RD=1). This density tracking change is calculated using a Voronoi\ntessellation (voro++ cell library) [Rycroft, 2009].\nSubsequently, the unloaded samples are submitted to a series of triaxial compression\nsimulations tests (Fig. 4.13 e) to analyze the macroscopic microstructure response. In\nthis step, an initial strain rate is applied in the axial (z direction), ε ̇z = −10−5 s−1 (to\nensure quasi-static conditions), with a con\u001cning radial pressure (σx = σy ). This numerical\nsetup allows a representation of a conventional experimental test where the axial stress\nincreases while the radial con\u001cning pressure remains constant. These unloaded samples\nare also tested in DEM tensile tests by applying a tensile strain rate in the z direction\n(ε ̇z > 0), and null stresses in x and y directions (σx = σy =0) up to sample's failure. This\nmethodology is used to generate the yield surface and fracture line (chapter 5).\n\n127\n\nCHAPTER 4. DEM: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION\n\nFigure 4.15: Local density map of a sample during jamming, close-die compaction, and\nunloading steps (calculated by Voronoi tesselation). The clusters (coarse alumina and\ngraphite) are considered fully dense (density RD = 1).\n\n4.8 Representative volume element (RVE)\nDue to the complexity of the microstructure geometry, we do not consider the real shape\nof the actual raw materials (alumina, graphite grains, and binder) in DEM. Still, we\ndeveloped a simple way to represent their microstructures, depending on their composition\n(as presented in the sections above). The macroscopic response of the composite should be\nisotropic (due to the random orientation of the graphite \u001dakes, the graphite behaves as an\nisotropic media). Therefore, isostatic compaction numerical simulations are performed on\nthree-dimensional Representative Volume Element (RVEs) packings containing di\u001berent\ntotal particles number. The objective was to determine the minimum number of particles\nnecessary to tend towards an isotropic response (zero deviatoric stress) and converge onto\na constant pressure value and a reasonable CPU time. Also, close-die compaction tests\nwere carried out to verify further the convergence of the macroscopic response with the\nnumber of particles for a di\u001berent stress state.\nFor each RVE, \u001cve di\u001berent packings were \u001crst generated from the 'gas of particles'\nstep using di\u001berent random seeds to locate the particles initially in the simulation box\n(section 4.6). This allows to have the same volume fractions for each packing but with\ndi\u001berent locations of particles. A total of thirty RVEs samples were generated for each\ncompaction type (e.g., close-die or isostatic) to allow deviation measurement. The mean\nand deviatoric stresses were calculated considering the \u001cnal stresses (end of the simulation)\nin the three-axis (x, y , and z ). They are written as:\nΣm = 1/3(σx + σy + σz )\n\n128\n\n(4.28)\n\n4.8. Representative volume element (RVE)\n\nΣd = σz − [1/2(σx + σy )]\n\n(4.29)\n\nwhere Σm and Σd are the mean and deviatoric stress, respectively.\nThe simulations stop when the packing is with a density of 0.95. The chosen density\ntarget (RD=0.95) makes the convergence criterion of the mean and deviatoric \u001cnal stresses\nquite demanding. For large values of relative densities (Fig. 4.9), the compaction curve\nbecomes vertically asymptotic. All numerical samples exhibited an initial size ratio of\nx : y : z = 1x1x2 x, y, and z axis with periodic boundary conditions.\nThe stresses are \u001crst measured with isostatic compaction simulations by applying an\nequal strain rate in x, y, and z axis (ε ̇x = ε ̇y = ε ̇z < 0). After, the stresses are analyzed\nwith close-die compaction simulations by applying an initial strain rate in z axis (ε ̇z < 0)\nand a null strain rate in x and y axis (ε ̇x = ε ̇y = 0).\nThe convergence of mean (Σm ) and deviatoric (Σd ) stresses, from isostatic DEM simulations, in absolute value, with the total number of particles for Mix 1 (reference composite) is shown in Fig. 4.16. For an RVE with n ≥ 380, 000 particles, e.g., the stresses converge with a low standard deviation. The simulations show that an RVE with n ≥ 117, 605\nparticles is large enough to ensure a good convergence of the measured macroscopic Σm\nand Σd stresses.\nThe RVE exhibits an anisotropic macro mechanical response for the compacted packing\nby isostatic con\u001cguration. The deviatoric stress (Σd ) is non-zero, i.e., even if applying an\nequal strain rate in the three-axis. This can be explained because we are limited to a \u001cnite\nnumber of particles (n). By increasing n, this anisotropy decreases with Σd closer to zero.\nBut, for n higher than 1 million particles, Σd is still di\u001berent than zero (approximately 4\nMPa on average). The second possible reason is the packing size ratio that is two times\nlarger in the axial direction (1x1x2), which translates into axial stress in z that is always\nslightly smaller than in x and y directions. The reason for this behaviour is not apparent\nsince we are using periodic conditions. The number of contacts between coarse alumina\nclusters in the x and z may be underestimated because there are only a few of those\ncontacts. Only very large boxes may smooth out this e\u001bect.\nThe ratio of the radial (1/2(σx + σy )) to axial (σz ) stresses has been reported for\nseveral powders compacted in closed-die conditions. Typically, it is of the order of 0.5 to\n0.75 at high density for metallic powders that deform plastically [Brown & Abou-Chedid,\n1994] [Mosbah et al., 1997] [Sridhar & Fleck, 2000]. This ratio leads to Σd /Σm =0.3-0.5.\nFor ceramic powders that compact through particles rearrangement and microstructure\nfracture, the radial to axial stress ratio is reported to be of the order of 0.6 to 0.7 [Shima &\nSaleh, 1993] [Sinka et al., 2001] leading to Σd /Σm =0.37-0.5. In our closed-die compaction\nsimulations, Σd /Σm is of the order of 0.34-0.38 for RVE's with n ≥ 117, 605 (Fig. 4.16),\n129\n\nCHAPTER 4. DEM: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION\nthat is slightly smaller than the average range encountered in the literature for ceramic\nmaterials. The composites studied in our work, when compacted by DEM simulations,\npresent an elastic deformation and a plastic response (due to the particles and clusters\nrearrangement; and of the binder behavior).\nThe convergence of Σm and Σd , in absolute value, from closed-die compaction simulations is shown in Fig. 4.17. Similar to the isostatic compaction simulations, an RVE with\nn ≥ 117, 605 particles leads to the convergence of the measured macroscopic stresses.\n\nFigure 4.16: Evolution of the macroscopic deviatoric and mean stress (in module) against\nthe total number of particles, at the end of isostatic compaction simulations (\u001cnal density\ntarget RD = 0.95).\n\nFigure 4.17: Evolution of the macroscopic deviatoric and mean stress (in module) against\nthe total number of particles, at the end of closed-die compaction simulations (\u001cnal density\ntarget RD = 0.95).\nThe mean and deviatoric stresses of all thirty samples (\u001cve samples for each total n\nof particles) from isostatic-compaction, and closed-die compaction DEM simulations, are\nshown in Figs. 4.18 a), and b), respectively. Fig. 4.18 a) shows that the average of Σm\nand Σd stresses for n ≥ 117,605 particles are Σm = -44.5 MPa, and Σd = 5.3 MPa. To\nhighlight the convergence area, in a), as the region where samples converge, an assumption\n130\n\n4.8. Representative volume element (RVE)\n\nwas made where the limit of convergence is ± 35% of Σd (3.5<Σd <7.2 MPa). Thus, it\nwas observed that for the 117,605 particles RVE, three samples are already inside this\nregion, out of \u001cve (Fig. 4.18 a).\nIn Fig. 4.18 b), for closed-die compaction, the average of Σm and Σd stresses for n\n≥ 117,605 particles is Σm = -29.4 MPa, and Σd = -10.4 MPa. We considered that the\nconvergence area is ± 13% of Σd (-9.1<Σd <-11.8 MPa). For an RVE with n = 117,605\nparticles, only one sample does not converge (out of \u001cve). The larger the number of\nparticles in RVE, the higher the number of samples laying inside the convergence region\n(e.g., n ≥ 117,605 particles).\nAs well, a lower divergence of the stress state can be predicted, compared with the\nisostatic compaction variation (Fig. 4.18 a). In isostatic compaction (a), the Σd is always\nslightly positive since the σz < 12 · (σx + σy ), and in closed-die compaction Σd is negative\nsince σz > 21 · (σx + σy ).\nThe aim of the present work is its application within industrial conditions. Thus,\nit becomes essential to have a reasonable CPU time and su\u001eciently accurate material\nmechanical properties. Therefore, an RVE with 117,605 particles was chosen because the\nmajor points are inside the selected convergence region (highlighted in the graph), see\nFig. 4.18 b). This way, this RVE provides a microstructure that ensures a reasonably\nisotropic response, converged macroscopic behavior, and a su\u001eciently low CPU time.\n\nFigure 4.18: Mean and deviatoric stress points from DEM: a) isostatic compaction simulations, and b) closed-die compaction simulations, depending on the total number of\nparticles (\u001cnal density target RD = 0.95).\n\nThe total clock time (from the generation of the samples up to the end of closed-die\ncompaction numerical simulations) against the total number of particles (between 14,567\nand 1,029,314) is shown in Fig. 4.19. The curve exhibits an almost linear evolution.\nEach simulation used a total of 8 CPUs (with the openMP parallel option in dp3D ). In\n131\n\nCHAPTER 4. DEM: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION\nsummary, the dp3D code has been parallelized with a \u001cne-grained method (at the loop\nlevel) with openMP directives. Note that because of the openMP parallelization and the\ncache miss, using more than 8 CPUs does not necessarily result in shorter clock times.\nThus 4 to 8 CPUs have been used in all simulations afterward.\n\nFigure 4.19: Simulations clock time from samples generation until the end of closed-die\ncompaction. Using 8 CPU's with the openMP parallel option in dp3D.\n\n4.9 Virtual \u001cring step modeling\nThe forming process of refractory ceramic powders is attained through compaction, curing,\nand \u001cring. The \u001cring consists in applying heat treatment to the cured material to obtain\nthe \u001cred product. Indeed, this \u001cnal step, referred to as sintering in powder metallurgy,\ninvolves di\u001busion and grain growth.\nHowever, in our work, the \u001cring process takes place at approximately 900°C, which is\ntoo low for alumina oxides sintering temperature (around 1400°C) [Cutler et al., 1957].\nAnyhow, \u001cring leads to the cohesion of the composite microstructure: i) at the mesoscale\n(coarse alumina grains, graphite \u001dakes, and the matrix), and ii) at the microscale (between\nne alumina grains and the carbonaceous binder). Also, during \u001cring, the binder is\nsubjected to pyrolysis that induces modi\u001ccations of its microstructure, accompanied by\neliminations of volatile compounds (weight loss) [Schmitt et al., 2002] [Zhang et al., 2018].\nIn this section, the methodology for the generation of virtual DEM \u001cred samples is \u001crst\ndescribed in section 4.9.1. Afterward, the \u001cred samples are submitted to mechanical\ntestings (section 4.9.2).\nIn addition, during \u001cring/pyrolysis, elimination of the binder occurs, introducing some\ndefects within the microstructure [Zhang et al., 2018]. The binder burnout can cause the\n132\n\n4.9. Virtual \u001cring step modeling\n\nformation of porosity in the body in two di\u001berent ways. The binder can recede in the\ninterparticle porosity, creating a porous shell that increases in size as pyrolysis proceeds.\nAnd, capillary pressure in the porous body causes rearrangement of the binder, creating\na distribution of porosity in the artifact [Wu et al., 2008].\n\n4.9.1 Samples generation\nTo mimic the cohesion between particles reached during the \u001cring, the DEM numerical\nred microstructure is represented by creating elastic bonds (in compacted samples) in\nbetween pairs of particles that are in contact (Fig. 4.20).\nIn the green DEM microstructure (after compaction), elastic bonds are considered\nonly between particles inside the coarse alumina and graphite particle clusters (Fig. 4.20\na), and the alumina is coated by a soft binder shell. In the virtual \u001cring, elastic bonds\nare introduced in all particles that are contacting each other on unloaded samples ((Fig.\n4.20 b). As well, during \u001cring, the resin is partially volatized, and the rest is carbonized.\nFurfural creates cohesion between alumina particles. Therefore, the virtual \u001cred composite matrix is represented by those elastic bonded \u001cne alumina particles (no soft binder\ncoating).\nWhen two-bonded particles i and j, and radius ri and rj contact each other, interaction\nat the bond scale is given by the microscopic bond model (Eqs (4.7) and (4.8)). Six bond\ninteractions are possible at the contact between coarse alumina, \u001cne alumina particles,\nand graphite. There are elastic bonds between \u001cne aluminas particles (1), between \u001cne\nalumina and graphite (2), between coarse alumina and \u001cne alumina (3), between coarse\naluminas (4), between graphite \u001dakes (5), and between graphite and coarse alumina (6)\n(Fig. 4.20 b).\nThe Young's modulus after the virtual \u001cring stage for coarse alumina and graphite\nclusters are the same as of the green stage (380 GPa for the coarse alumina, and 35 GPa\nfor the graphite), previously presented in Table 4.2. The Young's modulus of the matrix\nis 4 GPa. This value was set after calibration trials with experimental results (chapter 6).\nMaterial\nE (GPa) [Eqs. (4.7), (4.8)] ν [Eqs.

Thus, in e-1),\nthe unloaded sample is prepared to start following the numerical virtual \u001cring step by\ncreating bonds to all particles in contact.\n\n(closed-die compaction) (Fig. 4.21 c) with a \u001cnal axial stress target of 35 MPa to mimic the\nindustrial process. The closed-die compaction simulations were carried out with several\nrelative density targets (0.6 < RD ≤ 1). The sample is successively unloaded until equal\nstress of 1 MPa in the three-axis (Fig. 4.21 d).\nUntil the unloading step, the methodology applied is the same as for the green characterization. In sequence, the unloaded microstructure is numerically \u001cred by creating\nelastic bonds to all particles that are in contact, whatever their previous history of contacts\n(Fig. 4.21 e-1).\nDuring the \u001cring, the powder composite microstructure shows some damage and decohesions, mainly due to the mismatch of the coe\u001ecient of thermal expansion between the\nalumina, graphite, and binder. The \u001crst damage takes place at below 700°C, due to the\nresin pyrolysis, giving some plastic deformation to the resin. At this stage, there are still\ncontacts between the grains and binder. However, above 700°C, the pyrolysis of the resin\nis almost completed, and it is transformed into a more rigid bonding phase (pyrolytic\ncarbon). And, since the coe\u001ecient of thermal expansion of alumina is higher than that of\nthe pyrolytic carbon, compressive and tensile stresses are created around alumina grains\nresulting in microcracks within the matrix (Fig. 4.22 b) [Nicolas Tessier-Doyen, 2003].\nDuring the cooling, or when the temperature decreases below 700°C, the grains start to\npull the carbon and creating decohesion at their interface (called as 'bell e\u001bect') (Fig.\n135\n\nCHAPTER 4. DEM: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION\n4.22 c) [S. et al., 2010].\n\nFigure 4.22: Representation of stresses appearing during the pyrolysis e\u001bect: a) before\nthe \u001cring process b) during the \u001cring c) after the \u001cring (cooling-down e\u001bect). ( [Nicolas\nTessier-Doyen, 2003]\n\nIn general, on powder composites containing a carbonaceous binder, the weak regions\nafter \u001cring are located either in the matrix, which has a lower mechanical strength when\ncompared to the aggregates, or at the aggregate\u0015matrix interface [Schmitt et al., 2002].\nThis phenomenon occurs in two scales: i) within the matrix (between \u001cne alumina particles and the pyrolytic carbon), and ii) between the matrix and coarse alumina grains. It\nwas also possible to observe decohesions around graphite \u001dakes on X-ray tomography images which may be related to decohesions in the interface graphite/matrix [Werner et al.,\n2013].\nThus, to reproduce these decohesions/cracks within the microstructure to the DEM\nvirtual \u001cring, broken bonds were imposed between two pairs of materials: i) coarse alumina and \u001cne alumina particles, and ii) \u001cne alumina and graphite particles (Figure 4.23).\nBroken bonds do not transmit tensile forces but may transmit shear forces (friction) and\nrepulsive forces (section 4.3.2).\n\n4.9.2 Testing the numerical \u001cred microstructure\nCompacted powder composite samples (mix 1-4), by closed-die con\u001cguration up to 35\nMPa, were submitted to three di\u001berent mechanical testings (uniaxial and triaxial compression tests and Brazilian tests), see chapter 3. The main objective \u001crst was to evaluate\ntheir mechanical response when subjected to complex stress-state. And to estimate yield\nand fracture surfaces. In DEM, the virtual \u001cred microstructures (after the broken bonds\nstep), Fig. 4.24 e-2), follow two di\u001berent paths.\n136\n\n4.9. Virtual \u001cring step modeling\n\nFigure 4.23: X-ray tomography images showing voids around coarse alumina grains and\ngraphite, and in e-2), to represent these voids, we broke bonds between two pairs of\nmaterials: 1) between coarse alumina clusters and \u001cne alumina particles, and 2) between\nne alumina particles and graphite.\n\nFirst, an initial strain rate in tension was applied in the z axis (ε ̇z = 10−5 s−1 ) until\nsample's failure (Fig. 4.24 f). Second, to prepare these bonded broken samples (from Fig.\n4.24 e-2) for triaxial tests, the samples were subjected to pre-loading tests. Speci\u001ccally,\nan initial equal strain rate in x, y, and z axis was applied so that the samples could reach\nan isostatic stress-state (i.e., σx = σy = σz =5.4 MPa), as shown in (Fig. 4.24 g). In the\nsame experimental protocol, the \u001cred samples are subjected to a pre-loading of between\n5.2 and 5.7 MPa (chapter 3). This is mandatory since the con\u001cning pressure (from the\noil) and the axial pressure need to be equivalent at the beginning of the triaxial tests.\nIn sequence, the pre-loaded samples are submitted to a series of triaxial numerical tests\n(Fig. 4.24 h) by applying an initial compressive strain rate in the z direction (ε ̇z = −10−5\ns−1 ), so that the simulations could have an equal (and constant) stress in the x and y axis\n(σx = σy ). The matrix Young's modulus (=4 GPa) and other dp3D input parameters (e.g.,\n137\n\nCHAPTER 4. DEM: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION\n\nFigure 4.24: After the bonds breakage step, in DEM, e-2), the sample may be submitted\nto two types of testing. A direct tensile by applying a tensile strain rate in the z direction\n(f). A two-stages test with \u001crst a pre-loading stage (target: σx = σy = σz = 5.4M P a),\nand a traxial compression test by submitting an equal (and constant) stress in the x and\ny axis (σx = σy ).\nbond strength) were calibrated together with these numerical mechanical simulations and\nexperiments to reproduce the \u001cred macroscopic behaviour (chapter 6).\nTypical stress-strain curves of uniaxial compressive experiment and DEM simulations\nare shown in Fig. 4.25. In these simulations an initial axial strain rate ε ̇z = −10−5 s−1\nwas applied, so that an equal and constant null radial stress (σx = σy = 0) is ensured\n(as in the experiment setup). These simulations were performed with microstructures of\ndi\u001berent bond status and using an equal dp3D macroscopic input parameters. Fig. 4.25 a)\nrepresents the microstructure with intact particles bonds (no broken bonds), and in Fig.\n4.25, Fig. 4.25 b) with broken bonds between \u001cne alumina and coarse alumina particles,\nand Fig. 4.25 c) with broken bonds between \u001cne alumina and graphite particles. In\ngeneral, the stress-strain curves exhibit mostly ductile behaviour. However, the ultimate\naxial stresses (σz ) in a) and b) are smaller if compared with microstructure c). This can\nbe explained since the normal and tensile forces (Eqs. (4.7) and (4.8)) at the bond depend\non the bond interaction. An increase in the number of bonds also increases the material's\nsti\u001bness.\n\n138\n\n4.10.

It includes four components, coarse and \u001cne alumina, graphite\nakes, and a carbon binder. These components have complex behavior, and some are\ndrastically modi\u001ced along the process route (e.g., the binder and the graphite \u001dakes) under\nsevere thermo-mechanical conditions. We needed to simplify the composite material's\ntexture to allow DEM modeling with acceptable CPU simulation time. Notwithstanding,\nthese simulations are quite long for a number of particles n ≥ 117,605 (Fig. 4.19). The\nmade assumptions are:\n1. Coarse alumina and \u001cne alumina particles are spherical (coarse alumina is represented by clusters of single sphere particles);\n2. Graphite \u001dakes have rectangular shapes and are also represented by a particle cluster;\n3. The graphite internal particle bonds may break during compaction simulations,\nbringing some macroscopic plastic appearance. On the contrary, the internal particle\nbonds of the coarse alumina cannot fracture;\n4. The coarse alumina cluster and \u001cne alumina particles are coated by a binder shell,\nbut not the graphite;\n5. The binder has a soft elastic response (instead of plastic or viscoplastic) in the green\nstate;\n139\n\nCHAPTER 4. DEM: MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND DESCRIPTION\n6. The matrix of a virtual \u001cred microstructure is represented by \u001cne alumina particles\nbonded together if in contact but are disconnected from coarse alumina and graphite\nakes (bonds breakage).\nThe justi\u001ccations (from 1 to 6) for these assumptions are:\n1. Coarse and \u001cne alumina particle are clearly not spherical (Fig. 4.23). However,\ndiscrete simulations deal essentially with spherical objects. For coarse alumina,\nit could be envisioned to extract more realistic shapes from X-ray tomography.\nHowever, this would lead to some complexity in the \u001ctting procedure as it would\nintroduce some degree of arbitrariness in particle shape choice. Also, we believe\nthat the most important feature, from a mechanical point of view, is the very sti\u001b\nelasticity of alumina, as compared to the binder and the graphite;\n2. The reason for the simple rectangular shape adopted for the graphite is to ease DEM\nmodel. By the end of the compaction, graphite \u001dakes are subjected to meaningful\ndeformation due to the elastic bonds;\n3. X-ray tomography proves that the coarse alumina grains do not fracture after compaction. Conversely, the graphite deforms, and it presents some micro-cracks in its\ninterior may be due to the compaction;\n4. An alternative to the assumption of the absence of binder around graphite \u001dakes\nwould be to have binder around all components. It has not been tested yet. However, all the aluminas are covered with this soft binder, so all contacts between\ngraphite and alumina particles are binder coated (Fig. 4.8). Indeed, the number of\ncontacts between graphite clusters is negligible compared with other types of contacts (e.g., \u001cne alumina-\u001cne alumina and \u001cne alumina-coarse alumina). Therefore,\nthis assumption should not have a large e\u001bect on the macroscopic response of the\ncomposite, suggesting the irrelevance of a graphite binder coating;\n5. This assumption mainly provides a simple way to model the divergence in mechanical response between alumina and the binder. The plasticity of the binder may\nbe considered secondary. The rearrangement between alumina particles (\u001cne and\ncoarse) provides some plasticity at the macroscopic scale, reinforcing the validity of\nthe assumption;\n6. SEM observations clearly show decohesions between particles that can be ascribed\nto the thermal expansion coe\u001ecient mismatch between the binder and the other\ncomponents (alumina and graphite). This is indirectly con\u001crmed because the experimental response is best modeled when this assumption is used;\n140\n\n4.10. Conclusions\n\nIt can be seen from the above lists that the most critical assumptions are linked to\nthe binder. The binder is challenging to model as it transforms drastically along the\nprocess (due to its changing phase). Moreover, the binder is not an easily discernible\ncomponent in a DEM simulation as it is not a discrete particle. Nonetheless, we believe\nthat our assumptions are reasonable. They should help simplify the modeling, preserving\nthe ability to correct discrimination between the four composites (studied in the next\nchapter 5).\n\n141\n\nChapter 5\nDEM simulations on green powder\nrefractory materials\nThis chapter presents numerical simulations using the Discrete Element Method (DEM)\nto represent the compaction behavior and mechanical properties of carbon-bonded alumina refractory compositions. In DEM, the numerical composite microstructures are\nrepresented by a mixture between hard discrete particles (coarse alumina, \u001cne alumina,\nand graphite) and a soft-binder shell coating alumina particles (chapter 4). The numerical simulations (closed-die compaction and mechanical tests) are carried out using the\ncontact laws described in the previous chapter 4. First, The global view of the qualitative e\u001bect of DEM material properties in the compaction/unloading stages and the\ngreen strength resulting from numerical simulations are presented (section 6.3). As seen\nin chapter 4, depending on the particles' indention, coated particles may interact through\nthe soft binder (if su\u001eciently indented) or interact directly through their hard branch\n2. Therefore, each discrete component (coarse alumina, \u001cne alumina, and graphite) contributes to the composite macroscopic stresses with a di\u001berent magnitude (section 5.4.2).\nThe binder sti\u001bness greatly a\u001bects the densi\u001ccation and macroscopic hysteresis during\nunloading (section 5.4.3). The composite composition (mix 1-4) also a\u001bects the composite densi\u001ccation and macroscopic hysteresis mostly because of the binder-shell thickness\n(section 5.4.4). Closed-die compaction and triaxial/uniaxial compression numerical simulations are compared with experimental data (section 5.5). The isodensity yield surfaces\nand fracture points are generated triaxial and tensile simulations by controlling the radial\nstresses through the axial and radial strain rates (section 6.5). These surfaces obtained\nfrom DEM modeling provide valuable information on the behavior of green composites\nfor stress states that are di\u001ecult to attain by experiments.\n\n143\n\nCHAPTER 5.

DEM SIMULATIONS ON GREEN POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\n\n5.2 Introduction\nThe compaction of refractory composite powders is a basic process for refractory production. Understanding composite densi\u001ccation and the resulting mechanical properties is\na key factor for developing new products. The most critical step for modeling powder\nmaterial compaction with the help of the \u001cnite element method (FEM) is to formulate\nconstitutive equations. This task is challenging and time-consuming due to extensive experimental testing on green samples. Unlike the continuum mechanics approach (FEM),\nthe discrete element method (DEM) allows the particulate nature of the powder to be\nconsidered since the modeling treats the particle contact. DEM provides a tool for generating constitutive equations on a small representative volume to model a full-scale process\non FEM.\nFor this purpose, it is necessary to \u001crst understand the powder compaction behavior\nthrough appropriated discrete contact laws to develop yield and fracture surfaces that will\nbe used in FEM. As the particles are assumed to be spherical for simplicity, DEM describes\nhow the contact areas between particles in\u001duence the overall powder macroscopic stress\nbehavior when modeling a small representative volume element. DEM has been the object\nof many studies on the compaction of ceramic powders. However, despite the importance\nof such modeling, the use of DEM in carbon-bonded composite refractories has not yet\nbeen studied in the literature (chapter 2).\nIn this context, in this chapter, the compaction behavior is \u001crst investigated by modeling alumina particles coated by a soft binder shell mixed with bonded graphite particle\nclusters to represent carbon-bonded alumina refractory compositions. Second, it is shown\nhow the interaction between di\u001berent branches a\u001bects the macroscopic densi\u001ccation and\nspring-back during close-die compaction simulations. These data were compared with\nexperimental data. The compacted numerical samples were also submitted to mechanical tests (triaxial and tensile) to generate yield and fracture surfaces [Redanz & Fleck,\n2001][Heyliger & McMeeking, 2001] [Pizette et al., 2010]. The triaxial simulations were\ncarried out by imposing a constant axial strain rate and varying the radial stress to represent experimental mechanical test con\u001cguration. Thus, the possibility of a material\nfailure or densi\u001ccation was explored, providing valuable information on the behavior of\nthe composites for stress states that are di\u001ecult to obtain from experiments. These data\nwill provide crucial information for generating constitutive equations for the compaction\nmodeling using FEM (chapter 7), turning these DEM simulations into results that can be\nexploited in an industrial context.\n146\n\n5.3. Material properties\n\n5.3 Material properties\nIn the present work, the ability to model close-die compaction of refractory composites\nare tested. The compaction and mechanical simulations are carried out using the DEM\ninput elastic material parameters presented in chapter 3 (E for the material's Young's\nmodulus in GPa, and ν for the Poisson's coe\u001ecient). As previously mentioned in chapter\n4, Young's modulus of the alumina and graphite applied in DEM simulations are taken\nfrom the literature. The binder elasticity is calibrated with experimental data. According\nto [Gardziella et al., 2000], there are di\u001berent kinds of phenolic resins applications, and\nYoung's modulus can vary from 1.8 GPa to 13 GPa. In this Ph.D. work, the binder softshell Young's modulus is \u001cxed at 1.02 GPa for the green stage (compaction and mechanical\nnumerical simulations). This value is considered the best \u001ct with experimental data. The\nimpact of the binder sti\u001bness in the compaction and spring-back e\u001bect in the unloading\nis explained in detail in section 5.4.3. The DEM material properties applied for the green\ncharacterization are listed in Table 5.1. γ is the work of adhesion in J/m2, and μ is the\nparticles friction coe\u001ecient. γ =28J/m2 , and a standard friction coe\u001ecient value of 0.2\nfor all particle materials are chosen.

The qualitative impact of the DEM properties in the composite densi\u001ccation\n(during compaction), at the end of the unloading (spring-back e\u001bect), and the composite\ngreen strength from uniaxial compressive (crush) test simulations is exhibited in Table\n6.2.

The green composite strength is measured as the ultimate stress\n(the maximum stress which suggests a microstructure failure), in MPa, during uniaxial\ncompressive test simulations (ε̇z < 0, and σx = σy = 0).\n147\n\nCHAPTER 5. DEM SIMULATIONS ON GREEN POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\nThe increase of adhesion slightly decreases the RD reached at the end of the compaction. Consequently, the rise of adhesion also reduces the spring-back e\u001bect during the\nunloading. However, the increase of adhesion signi\u001ccantly increases the green strength\nduring uniaxial compressive test simulations because it increases the pull-o\u001b force (N DM T ,\nsee Eq. (4.4) in chapter 4).\n\nDEM property\nRDcomp. spring-back (%) green strength (MPa)\nWork of adhesion, ω , (J/m2) ⇑\n↓\n↓\n↑\nEbinder (GPa) ⇑\n↓\n↑\n↓\nσN and σT (MPa) ⇑\n↓\n↑\nTable 5.2: Qualitative impact of DEM material properties' on the green mechanical behavior during compaction, unloading, and uniaxial compressive test simulations.\n\nThe binder Young's modulus (Ebinder ) is the property that most dictates the densi\u001ccation, spring-back, and composite green strength. Concerning the densi\u001ccation, by\nincreasing Ebinder , the contacts become sti\u001ber (in comparison with a microstructure with\nlower Ebinder ), resulting in larger contact forces. Consequently, the composite exhibits\nhigher macroscopic stresses to a given relative density (more di\u001ecult to compact). About\nthe spring-back, the increase of Ebinder increases the number of particle contacts in the\nsoft binder branch, leading to a larger spring-back during the unloading. The increase of\nEbinder results in a less dense (porous) microstructure, leading to a decrease in the green\nstrength. Details concerning hard and soft contacts and the e\u001bect on the compaction and\nunloading simulations are described in detail in section 5.4.1.\nσN and σT are the bond particle strength in tension and shear, respectively. The bond\n\nstrength is active only for graphite. The coarse alumina cluster also has internal particle\nbonds, but these bonds cannot deform nor break (chapter 4). The graphite bond strength\n(σN and σT ) plays an important role in the composite compaction behavior. The increase\nin the graphite bond strength leads to sti\u001ber and stronger graphite \u001dakes (smaller composite relative density to given stress), increasing the composite strength. The graphite bond\nstrength has no signi\u001ccant e\u001bect on the spring-back during the unloading. As a note, the\ngraphite Young's modulus also impacts the composite densi\u001ccation and strength. However, since the Young's modulus of the graphite (and alumina) are known properties,\nwe decided not to modify it. Still, the binder is the component that most impacts the\ncomposite compaction behavior, spring-back, and strength.\n148\n\n5.4. Compaction and unloading simulations\n\n5.4 Compaction and unloading simulations\n5.4.1 Close-die compaction: behavior at the contact\nThe densi\u001ccation of a heterogeneous refractory composite in DEM compaction simulations\ndepends upon the interaction between non-coated graphite and alumina particles (\u001cne\nalumina particle and coarse alumina) coated by an elastic soft-binder shell, and between\ncoated alumina particles themselves. When two coated or non-coated and coated particles\ninteract, the contact can remain either in the soft shell (branch 1) or reach the hard\n(branch 2), see chapter 4. The main goal, in this section, is to improve the understanding\nof the composite densi\u001ccation, represented by a composite numerical microstructure made\nof both discrete components (coarse alumina, \u001cne alumina, and graphite) and a soft shell\nsurrounding alumina material. The elastic mechanical behavior at the contact is studied\nrst. The composite (macroscopic) behavior is then investigated (section 5.4.2).\nFor this purpose, the interaction between i) coated-coated, ii) and non-coated-coated\nparticles are studied. In dp3D, to track the history of particles at the contact, particles\ncan be tagged before running a simulation. Thus, the contact of tagged particles can\nbe followed during the compaction at each time step. A total of four pairs of particles\nare tagged: i) coarse alumina-graphite, ii) \u001cne alumina-graphite, iii) coarse alumina-\u001cne\nalumina, and iv) \u001cne alumina-\u001cne alumina. The contacts between two coarse alumina\nclusters are not presented because this type of contact is very rare. The graphs in the\npresent section originate from a closed-die compaction simulation of Mix 1 (reference\ncomposite) with a target of 35 MPa for the axial stress. We focus here on the behavior\nuniquely at the contact (particle interactions).\nThe evolution of the normal contact force (N Hertz ), Hertzian model (Eq. (4.16),\nchapter 4), against the particle relative indentation, δn /r, (r is the particle's radius)\nin closed-die compaction numerical simulation is shown in Fig. 5.1 a1) and a2). The\nevolution of the normal contact force (N Hertz ) against the composite relative density is\nshown in Fig. 5.1 b). Note that the Hertzian force starts at N Hertz < 0 (tensile), see\nFig. 5.1. At the beginning of the compaction, the contact is under tensile because of\nthe abrupt introduction of adhesion to the compaction simulation (jamming has neither\nfriction nor adhesion) (chapter 4).\nAn example of contact between coated coarse alumina and non-coated graphite particles is represented by contact type number 1) (Fig. 5.1 a2). The contact moves towards\nthe hard branch and the indentation is at the critical value (δ ̃n = t/r = 0.198, see Fig.\n5.2 1). In other words, the particles contact indent within the soft binder shell, increasing\nthe normal force signi\u001ccantly at the contact. Once the contact reaches the hard branch,\n149\n\nCHAPTER 5.

Contacts type 1) to 4) represent the particle contact between three components\n(coarse alumina, \u001cne alumina, and graphite). Once the contact reaches the critical indentation value (δ ̃n ), hard contacts appear (see Fig. 5.2). b) N Hertz versus composite\nrelative density (RD). ∗ represents the point where the interactions move towards the\nhard branch.\n\nthe contact is at the critical indentation.\nContact type number 2) (Fig. 5.1 a1) represents the contact between a coated \u001cne\nalumina particle and a non-coated graphite particle where δ ̃n is also equal to 0.198 (Fig.\n5.2 2). Similar to contact type number 1), the interaction is also at the hard (branch\n2). Contact type number 3) (Fig. 5.1 a2), is the interaction between two coated alumina\nparticles (\u001cne alumina and coarse alumina) that reach the hard alumina branch (Fig. 5.2\n3).\nContact type number 4) is represented by the contact between two coated \u001cne alumina\n150\n\n5.4. Compaction and unloading simulations\n\nparticles. Contrary to the previous contacts, the interaction remains in the soft (branch\n1). The relative indentation are lower than the critical value (δ ̃n < 2t/r = 0.39), as shown\nin Fig. 5.2 3) and 4). In this case, if the particles unload, the unloading path will follow\nthe same path given by the loading (no hysteresis).\nIt is worth mentioning that these curves are examples of the multiple contacts that arise\nin the simulation. During compaction, some contacts will hit the hard branch (contacts\ntype number 1, 2, and 3) while others will stay in the soft branch (contacts type number 4).\nAlso, the contact path at the hard branch seems vertical when the particles are unloaded,\nbut it has a \u001cnite slope dictated by the alumina Young's modulus (380 GPa). In other\nwords, the sti\u001bness at the contact when in the hard branch is dictated by the alumina, and\nin the soft branch, by the binder (alumina Young's modulus \u0014 binder Young's modulus).\n\nFigure 5.2: Related to contacts 1) to 4) highlighted in Fig. 5.1 above. 1) is the contact\nbetween coarse alumina and graphite when hard contact appears.

Above RD = 0.87, the contact is under a tensile force (N Hertz <\n0). Above RD = 0.92, the particles return on transmitting a compressive force (N Hertz >\n0). Overall, the contacts may unload, fail, and return to the previous contact several\n151\n\nCHAPTER 5. DEM SIMULATIONS ON GREEN POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\ntimes during the compaction.\nAs seen above, the contacts load and unload all along the compaction. These examples\nrepresent only a few contacts from hundreds of thousands of possible particle interactions.\nTherefore, to better understand whether the contacts remain in the soft or are at the hard\nbranch, the % correlated to the total number of elastic interactions between coated-coated\nand non-coated-coated particles (from the same close-die compaction simulation presented\nabove) are recorded (Fig. 5.3).\nB1 is the total number of contacts in the soft binder branch. B2 is the total number\nof contacts in the hard branch. B1 or B2 [mat. i - j] are the number of contacts between\ntwo components i and j in soft or hard branches, respectively. These components i, and j\ninclude \u001cne alumina, coarse alumina, and graphite. Five di\u001berent combinations between\ncoated-coated and non-coated-coated particles are possible: i) coarse alumina-coarse alumina, ii) coarse alumina-graphite, iii) coarse alumina-\u001cne alumina, iv) \u001cne alumina-\u001cne\nalumina, v) graphite-\u001cne alumina. Fig. 5.3 shows the evolution of the % of contacts in the\nhard and soft branches (related to the contact between the components) versus composite\nrelative density.\n\nFigure 5.3: DEM close-die compaction simulation (target σz = 35 MPa): % of the number\nof interactions in the soft branch a), and in the hard branch b). B1 is the total number of\ncontacts in the soft binder branch. B2 is the total number of contacts in the hard branch.\n\nThe contact between \u001cne alumina particles corresponds to approximately 80% of the\ninteraction in the soft binder (branch 1). Above RD=0.85, it is possible to observe a\ntransition in the curve slope and the reduction in the % of soft contacts (Fig. 5.3 a)\nbecause while the particles are compressed during the compaction, some of these soft\n152\n\n5.4. Compaction and unloading simulations\n\ncontacts move towards the hard alumina branch, as shown in Fig. 5.3 b). Overall, the\ncentral part of the contacts stayed in the soft elastic (branch 1), mainly related to \u001cne\nalumina contacts. This shows that most of the contacts stay in the soft branch and that\nthe binder plays a dominant role for a large portion of the compaction.\nThe type of contact (if soft or hard) will depend mostly on two factors: i) the binder\nelasticity and ii) the binder thickness (volume fraction). A softer elastic cover will tend\nto particles reach more easily the hard (branch 2). Indeed, a composite with a smaller\nbinder thickness (mix 2) will highlight more \u001cne alumina contacts at the hard (branch 2)\ncompared with the other compositions.\nIn this section, the contacts at the soft and hard branches between particles belonging\nto distinct materials were investigated. How do these interactions between coated-coated\nand non-coated-coated particles in the soft and hard branches will a\u001bect the composite\nmacroscopic behavior? Is the binder elasticity and thickness (related to the composition) an important factor for the composite densi\u001ccation behavior? These questions are\ninvestigated in the following sections.\n\n5.4.2 Macroscopic behavior\nDuring close-die compaction, each discrete material (\u001cne alumina, coarse alumina, and\ngraphite) contributes to the composite densi\u001ccation according to the di\u001berent types of\ncontacts and DEM input properties. The Hertzian elastic model governs the interaction\nbetween coated alumina particles and non coated-coated particles (graphite and alumina).\nThe internal (and bonded) graphite particles are represented by the bond model. In the\nprevious section, the behavior at the contact was detailed, taking as example mix 1\n(reference composite) during a closed-die compaction simulation. In the present section,\nthe same simulation is investigated but at the macroscopic stress level.\nThe evolution of the macroscopic axial stress associated with each discrete component\n(\u001cne alumina, coarse alumina, and graphite) and the total macroscopic axial stress (in z\ndirection) against the relative density is shown in Fig. 5.4. The coarse alumina curve represents the macroscopic axial stress contribution of coarse alumina component to the total\nmacroscopic axial stress during DEM close-die compaction simulations (see Eq. (4.14) in\nchapter 4). This stress includes contact contribution between coarse alumina-\u001cne alumina\nparticles, coarse alumina-graphite particles, and between coarse alumina particles of distinct clusters. To note: the bonds inside the coarse alumina cluster cannot deform either\nfracture, and these interactions are not considered in the stresses calculation (chapter\n4). Similarly, the graphite curve represents the macroscopic axial stress contribution of\ngraphite component to the total axial stress. It includes contacts between graphite-coarse\nalumina particles, graphite-\u001cne alumina particles, graphite particles from di\u001berent clus153\n\nCHAPTER 5. DEM SIMULATIONS ON GREEN POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\nters, and internal bonded graphite particles. Finally, the \u001cne alumina curve represents\nthe macroscopic axial stress contribution of the \u001cne alumina component to the total axial\nstress, including the contacts between \u001cne alumina particles, \u001cne alumina-coarse alumina\nparticles, and \u001cne alumina-graphite particles.\n\nFigure 5.4: DEM close-die compaction: contribution of the three di\u001berent discrete materials (\u001cne alumina, coarse alumina, and graphite) to the axial macroscopic stress (\u001cnal\ntarget: σz =35 MPa).\nThe \u001cne alumina contribution always represent more than 50% of the total axial stress,\nwhile the graphite is approximately 40% and the coarse alumina less than 10% (Fig. 5.4).\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the \u001cne alumina is the component that impacts\nmost the composite densi\u001ccation. Contacts between \u001cne alumina particles that are in\nthe soft binder shell contributes most to the \u001cne alumina part (Fig. 5.3). The contacts\nbetween \u001cne alumina-graphite and \u001cne alumina-coarse alumina also contribute to the \u001cne\nalumina stresses because the number of \u001cne alumina particles is much higher than the\nnumber of graphite and coarse alumina clusters. The macroscopic stress contribution of\ncoarse alumina is mostly due to the interaction between \u001cne alumina and coarse alumina\nparticles. The total contacts between coarse alumina and graphite in branches 1 and 2\ncorrespond to less than 1% (Fig. 5.3).\nThe macroscopic stress contribution of graphite, which is consistently a bit lower than\nthe \u001cne alumina contribution, comes from contacts between graphite-\u001cne alumina particles, and between internal bonded graphite particles. There are many more contacts\nbetween graphite-\u001cne alumina particles than contacts between coarse alumina-graphite\nparticles (the coarse alumina are in a smaller number). In addition, interactions between bonds that were not fractured and between bonds that were fractured during the\n154\n\n5.4. Compaction and unloading simulations\n\ncompaction are present inside graphite clusters.\nTo understand the e\u001bect of the contact laws (bond and Hertzian models) on the\ncompaction behavior, Fig. 5.5 shows the composite macroscopic axial stress (target:\nσz =35 MPa) versus relative density. The contact laws here are divided into three groups.\n\nFigure 5.5: DEM close-die compaction: contribution of the contact models to the axial\nmacroscopic stress (target: σz =35 MPa). a) Hertzian model (contact between non-bonded\nparticles), b) bonded model (contact between bonded particles inside the graphite), and\nc) between fractured bonds.\nThe \u001crst group (Hertzian model) includes interactions between coated components\n(coarse alumina-\u001cne alumina particles, coarse alumina particle clusters, and \u001cne alumina\nparticles). Also, contacts between a coated and a non-coated component (coarse aluminagraphite particles and \u001cne alumina-graphite particles) and between graphite particles from\ndi\u001berent clusters (Fig. 5.5 (a)).\nThe second one (Bond model) is represented by interactions between bonded particles\n(inside the graphite cluster) in which the bonds remain intact until the end of the compaction (Fig. 5.5 (b)). The third group (Bond model, broken bonds) represents contacts\nbetween bonded graphite particles (inside the cluster), fractured during the compaction\n(Fig. 5.5 (c)). As seen before in chapter 4, the tensile force from these broken bonds\ncomes from the DMT adhesion theory. The shear force comes from the Hertz-Mindlin\nfriction law, and the compressive forces between broken bonds.\nThe Hertzian contact (Fig. 5.5 (a)) contribution, to the total macroscopic axial stress\nduring the close-die compaction numerical simulation, represents nearly 70% of the composite macroscopic stress. The bond contact model (Fig. 5.5 (b)) has more than 10%,\nand the contact between broken bonded particles (Fig. 5.5 (c)) less than 20%. The\n155\n\nCHAPTER 5. DEM SIMULATIONS ON GREEN POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\npercentages are given from the end of the compaction simulation (RD=95.8%, 35 MPa).\nThe \u001cne alumina is the component that impacts mostly the macroscopic stresses (Fig.\n5.4) due to the many interactions belonging to the Hertzian model. First, these contacts\nare given from interactions between \u001cne alumina particles in the soft branch 1. In second, from contacts between graphite-\u001cne alumina particles, and in third between coarse\nalumina-\u001cne alumina particles.\nConcerning the bond contact model (Fig's 5.5 b) and c), the bonded particle strength\nin tension and shear (Eq's (4.9) and (4.10) from chapter 4) plays an important role in the\nstresses of non-fractured-bonded graphite particles and broken bonded graphite particles.\nThe tendency is that by increasing the bond strength, fewer graphite bonds are broken\nduring compaction, thus increasing the stresses coming from non-fractured bonds and\ndecreasing the stresses from broken bonds.\n\n5.4.3 E\u001bect of the binder elastic modulus\nDuring compaction simulations, the binder soft-shell is the factor that most impacts the\ncomposite macroscopic behavior, mainly between \u001cne alumina contacts. During the \u001crst\nstage of the compaction (loading), the binder greatly in\u001duences the composite densi\u001ccation. After unloading, the binder highly impacts the microstructure hysteresis (or\nspring-back). Thus, close-die compaction simulations on mix 1 (reference composite)\nwith a target of axial stress equivalent to 35 MPa (σz =35 MPa) were performed to investigate these phenomena. Only the binder Young's modulus is varied, and other dp3D\ninput microscopical mechanical properties remained the same, such as adhesion energy,\nfriction coe\u001ecient, bond strength. Elastic material properties are kept constant for the\nalumina and graphite. A total of \u001cve close-die compaction simulations are performed with\nbinder elastic modulus values (Ebinder ) varying from 0.1 to 3 GPa (Fig. 5.6), including\n(Ebinder =1.02 GPa) that is the best-\u001ct with experimental data (Table 5.1).\nFig. 5.6 a) shows axial stress (target: 35 MPa) vs. relative density curves during the\nclosed-die compaction simulation. In small binder Young's modulus (0.1-0.5 GPa) values,\nthe curve shows a softer behavior with spike pro\u001cles (due to the indentation between hard\nparticles). On the opposite, increasing the binder Young's modulus (1.02-3 GPa), the\ncurve exhibits a sti\u001ber behavior and a smoother pro\u001cle (no spikes). This smoother pro\u001cle\nmay be explained because the number of hard branch contacts is smaller on compaction\nsimulations with a higher binder Young's modulus (3 GPa). The evolution of the relative\ndensity at 35 MPa and the total % of hard contacts in branch 2, versus the binder Young's\nmodulus is shown in Fig. 5.6 b). At 35 MPa, the relative density (RD) of the numerical\ncomposite is 99.4%, 98.7%, 95.8%, 90.9%, and 87.7% for an input dp3D binder Young's\nmodulus (Ebinder ) value of 0.1 GPa, 0.5 GPa, 1.02 GPa, 2 GPa, and 3 GPa, respectively.\n156\n\n5.4. Compaction and unloading simulations\n\nFigure 5.6: Mix 1 (reference composite) close-die compaction simulations (Ebinder =0.1-3\nGPa): a) evolution of the axial macroscopic stress (σz ) against the composite relative density (loading). b) evolution of the relative density at the end of the loading (σz =35MPa)\nand total % of hard contacts, versus the binder Young's modulus (Ebinder ).\nFig. 5.7 a) shows the compaction loading curves (Fig. 5.6), and the unloading. The\nshape of the unloading curves becomes quite di\u001berent following the modi\u001ccation of the\nEbinder . The area under the loading and unloading slopes (dissipated energy) is reduced\nby increasing the binder Young's modulus. As seen in chapter 4, in dp3D, the magnitude\nof the composite macroscopic spring-back will depend on the type of contact (branch 1\nor 2). The binder is modeled as pure elastic, but when two particles in branch 2 are\nunloaded, they unload all along down to separation with the sti\u001bness of branch 2 (the\nsti\u001ber one), introducing hysteresis at the contact (chapter 4).\nThe composite spring-back percentage is calculated as the composite relative density\n(RD) di\u001berence between the end of the loading (at σz =35 MPa) and the end of the\nunloading (at σz =1 MPa). The evolution of the spring-back % and the % of the total\nof contacts in the hard branch during the loading, as a function of the binder Young's\nmodulus is shown in Fig. 5.7 b). The % of contacts in branch 2 is calculated by the\nratio between the total of contacts in branch 2 and the sum of the number of contacts\nin branch 1 and branch 2 (at the end of the loading, 35 MPa). Note that the graphite\nbonded particle contacts are not included because it is not a Hertzian contact.\nFrom a binder Young's modulus between 0.1 GPa and 2 GPa, the % of contacts in\nbranch 2 decreases resulting in the increase of spring-back during unloading. At 0.1\nGPa, the composite spring-back % is almost close to zero because the major part of the\ncontacts are in branch 2 (≈ 80%). For Ebinder ≤2 GPa, the spring-back is increasing with\nthe Ebinder . The spring-back is almost constant between Ebinder = 2 − 3 GPa because the\ncomposite is sti\u001b, and it becomes more di\u001ecult for the composite to densify (see previous\nFig. 5.6 b).\n157\n\nCHAPTER 5. DEM SIMULATIONS ON GREEN POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\n\nFigure 5.7: Mix 1 (reference composite) close-die compaction simulations (Ebinder =0.1-3\nGPa): a) evolution of the axial macroscopic stress (σz ) against the composite relative\ndensity (loading and unloading curves). b) the total number of contacts (%) in the hard\nalumina branch during the loading, and the spring-back (%) after unloading, as a function\nof the binder Young's modulus.\n\nIn summary, upon indentation during the loading, the rigidity of the contact evolves\nsteeply when a critical indentation is reached (enter into the hard branch 2). If this\ncontact at branch 2 is unloaded, some hysteresis is introduced. During the \u001crst stage of\nthe compaction (loading), some particles might be unloaded. During the second stage of\nthe compaction (unloading), most contacts will unload with a sti\u001bness that depends on\nthe branch it has reached upon loading. Therefore, the spring-back % during unloading\nwill depend on the % of contacts in the hard branch during the loading.\nIdeally, the binder should be modeled as elasto-plastic to minimize the composite\nspring-back impact during the unloading. However, this would increase the model complexity since new contact models should be introduced when allowing both elasticity and\nplasticity for the binder. The binder is the material that dictates most the material den158\n\n5.4. Compaction and unloading simulations\n\nsi\u001ccation and spring-back behavior. In the next section, the e\u001bect of the composition on\nthe material behavior during close-die compaction simulations will be investigated.\n\n5.4.4 E\u001bect of the composition\nIn this section, the impact of the composite composition on the composite response\nthrough DEM close-die compaction simulations is studied. Each composite has a variation on \u001cne alumina, coarse alumina, graphite, and binder in volume fraction percentage.\nThe studied composites composition is listed in Table 3.1 (chapter 3). Table 4.3 (chapter 4) shows the number of \u001cne/coarse alumina particles, graphite particles, and binder\nthickness calculated from the composition of the composite materials.\nIn summary, Mix 2 has a smaller binder volume fraction (%), Mix 3 is the opposite\nof Mix 2 (more binder vol. fraction %), Mix 4 is the composite with more reinforcement\n(more graphite and coarse alumina volume fraction %), in comparison with the reference\ncomposite (mix 1). The DEM input properties, already presented in Table 5.1 for the green\ncharacterization, remains the same for all simulations on the four powder composites, and\nso only the number of particles and the binder thickness is modi\u001ced.\nThe evolution of the axial macroscopic stress, of the four composites (Mix 1-4), with\ntheir relative density (RD) during numerical close-die compaction simulations, is shown\nin Fig. 5.8 a). The simulations stopped at 35 MPa axial stress. By decreasing the binder\nvolume fraction (thickness), the curves exhibit a sti\u001ber behavior. Mix 4, the composite\nwith more hard particles (coarse alumina and graphite) exhibits a loading curve with\nmore spike pro\u001cles due to the hard particles indentation.\nAt 35 MPa, the relative density (RD) of the mix 1-4 are 95.8% ± 0.06, 91.3% ± 0.03,\n97.5% ± 0.14, and 94.5% ± 0.38, respectively (Fig. 5.8 b), with the following ascending\ndensi\u001ccation ranking: mix 2 < mix 4 < mix 1 < mix 3. The binder volume fraction\nincrease leads to an increase of the relative density at a given stress. This is explained\nbecause of the decrease of the % of hard contacts (branch 2). The increase of the binder\nvolume fraction with the spring-back percentage exhibits almost a linear relationship with\nthe binder content due to the decrease of contacts in the hard (branch 2), as shown in\nFig. 5.8 c).\nIn summary, the increase of soft contacts (and consequently, a decrease of contacts\nin the hard (branch 2), together with the rise of binder volume fraction, mostly between\nne alumina particles, leads to a denser microstructure at the end of the loading. It\nalso leads to a more signi\u001ccant spring-back after unloading. Thus, the binder is the major\nfactor a\u001becting the composite densi\u001ccation and spring-back e\u001bect. For example, a thinner\nbinder shell will increase contacts at the hard alumina branch and, consequently, a smaller\ncomposite spring-back e\u001bect.\n159\n\nCHAPTER 5.

The stresses are calculated from the stress\npartition as described in chapter 4 (Eq. 4.14). Even though it is clear that the signi\u001ccant\npart of contacts is related to the contact between \u001cne alumina particles, the objective\nhere is to evaluate the evolution of the stresses associated with each material depending\non the composite composition.\nThe macroscopic axial stress (in average) correlated to \u001cne alumina material ranges\nbetween 8.3 MPa to 14 MPa in the ascending order: mix 4 < mix 3 < mix 1 < mix 2. Mix\n2 shows a signi\u001ccant increase in stress compared with the other compositions. This can\nbe explained because mix 2 is the composite with a smaller soft binder thickness and a\n160\n\n5.5. Comparison with experiments\n\nFigure 5.9: Contribution of the macroscopic axial stress related to each discrete material\n(coarse alumina, graphite, and \u001cne alumina) to the total macroscopic axial stress (experiments and simulations) of composites (mix 1 to 4), against the binder volume fraction\n(in %), during close-die compaction simulations (target: density RD=0.90).\n\nlarger quantity of \u001cne alumina particles. Thus, more contacts in the hard alumina branch\nduring the compaction (branch 2) increase the macroscopic stresses at a given relative\ndensity. Concerning graphite, the macroscopic stresses associated is between 6.1 MPa\nand 10.4 MPa (mix 3 < mix 1 < mix 4 < mix 2).\nStill, mix 2 is the composite with larger stress due to mainly the contacts between\nne alumina and graphite particles. Mix 4 is the composite with larger graphite particle\nclusters, and it comes in second. The macroscopic axial stress related to coarse alumina\nis very small if compared with the other two discrete materials, and it corresponds to\n0.7 MPa-1.3 MPa (mix 1 < mix 3 < mix 4 < mix 2). This is explained because the\nnumber of contacts between coarse alumina particle clusters is very small. Finally, the\ntotal macroscopic axial stress is in ascending order: mix 3 < mix 1 < mix 4 < mix 2,\nwhich is correlated mainly to the \u001cne alumina and graphite discrete materials.\n\n5.5 Comparison with experiments\n5.5.1 Close-die compaction\nThe \"weakly jammed\" packing at RD=0.6 can be compacted following two di\u001berent\nroutes: close-die compaction and isostatic compaction (chapter 4). However, isostatic\ncompaction experiments using small samples are challenging to perform due to the testing\n161\n\nCHAPTER 5. DEM SIMULATIONS ON GREEN POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\ncomplexity. It is necessary to control the stresses in the axial and radial directions (they\nmust be constant and equivalent during the compaction). Because of this, we focused\nmostly on performing DEM close-die compaction modeling to calibrate the numerical\ndensi\u001ccation behavior with closed-die compaction experimental data. The comparison of\nthe axial stress versus the sample relative density using numerical (DEM) and experimental close-die compaction tests of mix 1 (reference composite) are exhibited in Fig. 5.12.\nThe experiments and the simulations are set to a \u001cnal target of 35 MPa to mimic the\nindustrial setup.\n\nFigure 5.10: Mix 1 close-die compaction experiment (time-controlled test) and DEM\nclose-die compaction simulation: evolution of the axial macroscopic stress, in absolute\nvalue, in the z direction (σz ) versus the composite relative density. The evolution of the\nnumerical microstructure during the compaction is also highlighted. Target: σz =35 MPa.\nThe \u001crst compaction stage (loading) shows a good agreement in the densi\u001ccation behavior between DEM and experiment. Thanks to the introduction of a soft continuous\ncoat (binder), the present model can account for the e\u001bect of the di\u001berent components in\nthe composite compaction behavior. However, the spring-back e\u001bect in DEM is overestimated in comparison with the experiment. This is because the binder Young's modulus\nhighly a\u001bects the composite spring-back behavior when the \u001cne alumina particles are\nmainly in the hard alumina (branch 2) (Fig. 5.7). One solution to decrease the macroscopic spring-back would be to change the behavior at the contact during unloading by\nintroducing some plasticity. When two particles coated by the soft binder shell are in\nbranch 2, some hysteresis is introduced at the contact. However, the present DEM simulation presents more contacts at branch 1 (soft).\nThe \u001cnal relative density at the end of DEM and experimental close-die compaction\ntests are plotted with the compaction pressure (Fig. 5.11). The RD at 10 and 35 MPa from\n162\n\n5.5. Comparison with experiments\n\nexperiments exhibit an RD of 84.5% ±0.38 and 95.5% ±0.3, respectively. At RD=100%,\nthe compaction pressure is 77.5 MPa ±2.3. In DEM 85.3% (10 MPa), 95.8% (35 MPa),\nand 100% (68.5 MPa). The DEM and experimental data show a good quantitative agreement in RD vs. compaction pressure for the \u001crst part of the closed-die compaction tests\n(loading) for the Mix 1 composite.\n\nFigure 5.11: Final relative density reached at the end of the loading during close-die\ncompaction experiments and DEM simulations (Mix 1) against the axial stress (or compaction pressure) in MPa.\nThe main purpose of this section is to demonstrate the ability of DEM to represent\nthe compaction behavior of the four commercial composites. The evolution of axial stress\n(compaction pressure) against the sample relative density achieved by DEM and experimental closed-die compaction tests of mix 1-4 (with end target 35 MPa) is shown in Fig.\n5.12. The experimental and DEM curves exhibit a good qualitative agreement giving\nsome con\u001cdence in the ability of DEM to represent the compaction behavior of this type\nof composite considering their respective compositions.\nThe comparison of the spring-back e\u001bect (or hysteresis) during the unloading on experiments and DEM simulations is shown in Figs. 5.13 a) and b). At the beginning of\nthe unloading, or below σz ≈ 20 MPa, the DEM curve exhibits a linear behavior followed\nby a large hysteresis that follows almost the same behavior from the loading curve (Fig.\n5.13 b). However, as previously seen in chapter 3, in reality, as the system is viscous,\ncompaction is still progressing during the unloading (Fig. 5.13 a). Also, during the DEM\nunloading simulations, the spring-back e\u001bect is overestimated compared with experiments.\nOn DEM, the spring-back tends to increase with the increase of the binder volume\nfraction (Fig. 5.8 c) due to the decrease of contacts in the hard (branch 2). The DEM\nunloading model is simpli\u001ced to ensure an anisotropic stress state close to zero for the\n163\n\nCHAPTER 5.

Since there are no bonds between the \u001cne alumina particles,\nonly a few bonds inside the graphite clusters during the uniaxial compression are broken.\nThe sample deforms to the radial direction due to the axial compression stress, increasing\nporosity (RD decreases).\n164\n\n5.5.

On DEM, three\ndi\u001berent packing microstructures of each composition are tested to evaluate the dispersion of the results. The uniaxial strength from DEM simulations is in the ascending order:\n4.5 MPa ±0.31 (Mix 2), 3.7 MPa ±0.29 (Mix 4), 4.4 MPa ±0.36 (Mix 1), and 4.2 ±0.03\n165\n\nCHAPTER 5. DEM SIMULATIONS ON GREEN POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\n(Mix 3). From experiments, the strength is: 3.8 MPa (Mix 2), 3.5 MPa (Mix 4), 3.8\nMPa (Mix 1), and 4.5 MPa (Mix 3). The impact of each component (\u001cne alumina, coarse\nalumina, and graphite) on the composite strength is shown in Fig. 5.15 b).\n\nFigure 5.15: a) Comparison between the maximum stress (compression strength) through\nDEM uniaxial compression test simulations (σx = σy = 0) and uniaxial compression test\nexperiments against the binder volume fraction % (mix 1-4). b) Typical axial stress-strain\ncurves from DEM simulations.\nThe green strength depends mostly on the binder content and the microstructure\ncomposition (chapter 4). Similar to experiments, the composition with a lack of the\nmatrix content (\u001cne alumina and binder) and more coarse alumina and graphite (Mix\n4) exhibits a smaller strength because of the decreased macroscopic stresses associated\nwith \u001cne alumina. Mix 2 (more \u001cne alumina particles and less binder) has shown the\nlargest strength due to increased macroscopic stresses correlated to \u001cne alumina contacts.\nThese alumina particles are coated with a thinner binder shell, leading to increased hard\ncontacts (branch 2). Unlike the experiments, Mix 3 has shown a decrease in strength. The\noverestimation of the spring-back may a\u001bect the composite strength measurement since\nthe numerical composite is more porous than in reality. The axial stress-strain from these\n166\n\n5.5. Comparison with experiments\n\nDEM uniaxial compression test simulations are shown in Fig. 5.15 c). Analyzing the\nlinear slopes, Mix 2 exhibits sti\u001ber behavior due to a lack of binder (more hard alumina\nparticle contacts). Mix 3 (more binder content) is less sti\u001b due to the larger number of\nsoft contacts.\nThe compacted samples (Mix 1) are submitted to triaxial compression tests at three\ndi\u001berent con\u001cning pressure (or radial stress), 10 to 30 MPa, and compared with DEM\ntriaxial test simulations. A stress-strain curve from a numerical triaxial simulation with\nradial stress equivalent to 30 MPa is shown in Fig. 5.16. The evolution of the numerical\nsample microstructure is also highlighted. As seen in chapter 4, the stresses at the radial\ndirection (σx = σy ) are increased together with σz until the radial stress remain constant,\nand only σz continues to increase. Some graphite bonds are broken during the compression\nsimulation.\n\nFigure 5.16: Stress-strain curve from DEM triaxial test simulation at σx = σy = 30\nMPa.

Fig. 5.17 c) represents the triaxial\ncompression behavior of numerical and real samples previously compacted up to RD ≈\n100%. The DEM stress-strain curves for radial stress between 10 MPa and 30 MPa show\n167\n\nCHAPTER 5. DEM SIMULATIONS ON GREEN POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\ngood accordance with experiments. This is encouraging since material properties have\nnot been \u001ctted for these complex stress states.\nThe \u001crst part of the experimental stress-strain curves exhibits a rough linear shape that\nmay be explained by the viscous-elastic binder e\u001bect, grain rearrangement, and increase\nof the radial stresses. In DEM, the rough linear part is also because of the radial stresses\nand sample densi\u001ccation (that could not be studied experimentally). The non-linear curve\nshape departs since only the radial stress (σx = σy ) remains constant, and the axial stress\ncontinues to increase. Depending on the radial stress value, the microstructure can be\ncompacted or fractured (next section). In general, the deformation of the linear part\nof the curves is increased when testing more porous samples due to the more facility of\nparticle rearrangement during the triaxial compressive simulation.\n\n168\n\n5.6.

First, the methodology\nfor the generation of these points is carefully described (section 5.6.1). In sequence, the\ne\u001bect of the composite density after compaction (section 5.6.2), the e\u001bect between close169\n\nCHAPTER 5. DEM SIMULATIONS ON GREEN POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\ndie and isostatic compaction samples (section 5.6.3), and of the composition (section 5.6.4)\non the fracture and isodensity yield points are also presented.\n\n5.6.1 Identi\u001ccation of the isodensity yield surface and fracture\npoints\nThe generation of isodensity yield surfaces and fracture points were obtained by applying\nvarious reloading paths with constant strain rate in the z -axis and by varying the stress\nin the x, and y directions. For this purpose, the numerical 'jammed' packings at RD=0.6\nare compacted up to a given relative density, unloaded and reloaded to obtain these yield\nand fracture contours in the stress space. These reloading points are plotted in the mean\nstress vs. deviatoric stress plane (mean stress Σm = 1/3(σx + σy + σz ) and deviatoric\nstress Σd = σz − [1/2(σx + σy )]).\nAn example of the loading (1) and unloading (2) stress path in the stress space for the\nreference mix 1 numerical sample in closed-die condition (up to an axial stress equivalent\nto 35 MPa) is shown in Fig. 5.18. The * symbol represents the point of a isotropic\nstress state at the end of the unloading (σx = σy = σz =1MPa). In this case, the mean\nand deviatoric stresses are Σm = = -1MPa and Σd = = 0MPa, respectively. In [Pizette\net al., 2010], the reloading is restricted to the case where Σd >0, however in our case,\nthe deviatoric stress may be negative if σz >1/2(σx + σy ) (more common), or sometimes\npositive if σz <1/2(σx + σy ).\nFrom the unloading point, we apply \u001crst an uniaxial tensile test with an axial strain\nrate ε ̇z > 0 by pulling the sample in the z -axis. For this simulation, the radial stresses\nin x and y are equal to zero (σx = σy =0), and is represented by the number (3), see Fig.\n5.19 3). At this point, Σm ==-0.2MPa, and Σd =0.8MPa. At point (4), an equal and\nconstant tensile strain rate is applied at the three axis (isostatic tensile test), Fig. 5.19\n4), and because the numerical composite has an anisotropic macro mechanical response\n(RVE study in chapter 4), the three stresses are not exactly equivalent, thus Σm =1MPa,\nand Σd =-0.1MPa.\nSeveral reloading tests are performed to explore whether the material is densi\u001ced or\nfractured. The macroscopic fracture on DEM was deduced from the maximum stress on\nthe z -axis component associated with a decrease of the sample relative density. The point\n(5) from the Fig. 5.18 is represented by an uniaxial compression test previously seen in\nsection 5.5.2 where a compressive axial strain rate is imposed in the z and radial stresses\nequal to zero (σx = σy =0). The sample is progressively damaged (decreasing the RD)\nduring the simulation until a maximum σz is reached (Fig. 5.20 5). At this point (5),\nΣm =-1.3MPa, and Σd =-4.1MPa. (6) and (7) are examples of triaxial test simulations\nwith radial stress equivalent to 5 and 10 MPa. In (6), the sample is \u001crst compacted and\n170\n\n5.6. Yield and fracture surfaces\n\nFigure 5.18: Isodensity contour points (RD=95.8%) and fracture points of a compact\ngenerated in closed-die compaction from DEM simulation (target: σz =35MPa), and unloaded.

In (7), the sample is \u001crst compacted, and then fractured\n(decrease of RD), and compacted again (Fig. 5.20). In cases (6) and (7), the fracture\npoint is de\u001cned as the maximum axial stress together with the RD decrease. Similar to\n[Pizette et al., 2010], the link between these fracture points leads to a shape that is likely\nlinear.\nIn sequence, by increasing the radial stresses (σx = σy ) the composite undergoes compaction and is densi\u001ced until obtaining the same relative density reached at the end of the\nclose-die compaction. This methodology, applied to generate the isodensity yield surface\npoints, was previously used in numerical simulations on granulate materials [Pizette et al.,\n2010] [Harthong et al., 2012] [Abdelmoula et al., 2017] [Loidolt et al., 2019]. The points\n(8) and (9) from Fig. 5.18 are represented by triaxial test simulations with σx = σy =20\nand 26.5 MPa, respectively. The samples are densi\u001ced up to RD=0.958 (same density\nreached at the end of the closed-die compaction), see Fig. 5.21. In (9), at RD=0.958,\nthe three stresses are equivalent (Σd =0). Further increases of the radial stress, the deviatoric stress becomes positive since σz <1/2(σx + σy ). If continuously increasing the radial\nstresses, the limit of densi\u001ccation is reached since we stipulate a limit (RD=0.958). This\n`limit' point is highlighted in Fig. 5.18 with a red arrow. In general, the isodensity yield\nsurface presents a concave shape that was also observed in [Chen, 2008] (Fig. 4.32) during\n171\n\nCHAPTER 5.

The evolution of the yield and fracture surfaces as a\nfunction of the RD is shown in Fig. 5.22. They represent samples previously compacted by\nclosed-die con\u001cguration from RD=0.8 to RD=1 and summarise the hardening evolution\nduring the increase of the composite density. Like in the previous Fig. 5.18, these surfaces\nhave a similar general shape: a fracture line and a cap that can be \u001ctted with the DruckerPrager/Cap model. Inside the yield surface, the powder deforms elastically, and if the\nstress state reaches the yield surface, the powder deforms plastically [Abdullah et al.,\n2009] [Shin & Kim, 2015] [Zhou et al., 2017]. A constitutive model based on the DruckerPrager/Cap criterion for modeling close-die compaction through the \u001cnite element method\nwill be described in chapter 7.\n\n5.6.3 E\u001bect of the consolidation path\nThe consolidation path was \u001crst presented by closed-die compaction since the green experimental characterization was performed on samples compacted by closed-die con\u001cguration.

Both samples were previously compacted\nup to RD=0.95. Also, it is interesting to understand the e\u001bect of the strain history of the\npowder on the behavior of the compact. For isostatic compaction, the method to obtain\nisodensity yield points is identical to the previous sections.\nFor both compaction con\u001cgurations, similarly to section 5.6.1, the points which characterize the Σd <0 region of the stress space were added. The loading points in red (close-die)\nand blue (isostatic) are represented by the mean and deviatoric stress state at the end\nof the compaction (before unloading). As seen in chapter 4, the loading point from isostatic compaction does not present deviatoric stress equal to zero (Σm =-35.6MPa and\nΣd =3.7MPa). This is because the composite microstructure cannot have a full isotropic\nbehavior due to the limited number of particles. Both fracture surfaces are very similar\n(linear shape). However, the shapes of the isodensity yield surfaces are di\u001berent. The\n173\n\nCHAPTER 5.

However, in Pizette et al., isostatic and close-die compactions resulted in much more di\u001berence between the yield surfaces (see Fig. 2.24 in chapter 2).\nHere the two surfaces are quite similar.\n\n5.6.4 E\u001bect of the composition\nThe approach described in the previous subsections can also be applied to the four di\u001berent\ncompositions: mix 1, mix 2, mix 3, and mix 4. Here, the composites were compacted by\nclosed-die up to a density RD=0.90. All tested compositions show the same behavior\nobserved in the previous sections: a failure line and a cap surface. Increasing the binder\nratio, which is a soft material, leads to a strength decrease. Mix 2 highlighted a concave\nyield surface format, whereas the other composites have a more convex shape. This\nis probably due to the larger stresses if compared with the other composites. Observe\nthat in the previous Fig. 5.22 the increase in the sample hardening lead also to a more\npronounced concave shape (RD=1) compared with the other samples compacted up to a\nsmaller density.\n\n174\n\n5.6.

Conclusions\n\n5.7 Conclusions\nThis chapter has explored the potential of DEM for simulating the compaction of ceramic\npowder composites. For this purpose, \u001crst, a qualitative study concerning the impact of\nDEM input properties on the macroscopic composite behavior was investigated (section\n6.3). The binder coating is the material that most dictates the macroscopic behavior. During the compaction, the particle interactions can remain in the soft binder shell (branch 1)\nor move towards the hard alumina (branch 2). These two types of interactions will depend\non 1) composition and 2) binder sti\u001bness. First, a composite with less binder presents\na smaller binder thickness leading to more coated-alumina particles moving to branch 2.\nSecond, a softer binder (lower Young's modulus) leads also to contacts that move in larger\nnumbers to branch 2. Thus, sti\u001ber contacts (branch 2) result in larger elastic forces at the\ncontact, more signi\u001ccant macroscopic stresses, and a less dense composite (smaller RD).\nWhen the particles at branch 2 (hard) are unloaded (not necessary only during unloading\nsimulations), it introduces some hysteresis to the contact. Thus, the spring-back e\u001bect\nwill be smaller in a composite with more contacts at the hard (branch 2).\nThe e\u001bect of each discrete material (\u001cne alumina, coarse alumina, and graphite) on the\ncomposite compressive macroscopic stress was investigated. Fine alumina and graphite\nparticles contribute to more than 50% and 42% of the macroscopic axial stress, respectively, whereas coarse alumina to 6%. The stresses corresponding to alumina contacts\ncome from the Hertzian model, whereas the interactions between bonded graphite particles from the bond model. These interactions between bonded particles (i.e., internal\nbonded particles graphite cluster) can be divided into interactions between non-fractured\nparticles and fractured ones. The Hertzian contact generates approximately 69% of the\naxial macroscopic stress, and the Bond contact model with a) non-fractured bonds (12%),\nand b) fractured bonds (18%).\nDuring close-die compaction, some factors can impact the powder composite anisotropy.\nFirst, the graphite is highly orientation-dependent (anisotropic), and depending on its orientation (if parallel or perpendicular, e.g.), the graphite Young's modulus can signi\u001ccantly\nvary. Second, as the radial and axial stresses are quite di\u001berent, graphite \u001dakes will be\nmore oriented in the perpendicular direction of the compression (z-axis), increasing the\ncomposite anisotropy as was con\u001crmed by our DEM simulations.\nConcerning the comparison between DEM and experimental data on the close-die\ncompaction, the \u001crst stage of the compaction (loading) shows a good agreement when\nconsidering di\u001berent compositions. However, the spring-back presented in the second\nstage (unloading) is overestimated compared to experiments because the major part of the\nalumina contacts is in branch 1 (soft). One possible solution to minimize this discrepancy\n177\n\nCHAPTER 5. DEM SIMULATIONS ON GREEN POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\nwould be to introduce some plasticity at the contact at branch 1. The stress-strain curves\nfrom numerical and experimental triaxial tests show a good agreement for the reference\nmix 1, giving some con\u001cdence in the ability of DEM to represent the green mechanical\nbehavior of such powder composite materials.\nFinally, we have shown that it is possible to obtain yield and fracture surfaces in the\nstress state of a representative volume element of a composite powder. The generation of\nthese surfaces was obtained by applying various reloading paths with constant axial strain\nrates and varying radial stresses. The triaxial tests are carried out to explore whether the\ncomposite is densi\u001ced or fractured. The macroscopic material failure was estimated from\nthe maximum axial stress and decreased relative density. The connection between these\npoints leads to a linear shape (fracture line). We de\u001cne the yield surface as the surface\nlinking the points where the microstructure is densi\u001ced until obtaining the same relative\ndensity reached at the end of the compaction simulations (isodensity points). The main\nadvantage of this approach is to allow probing points in the deviatoric-mean stress space\nthat are very di\u001ecult or impossible to be measured experimentally. The generation of\nthese surfaces will be exploited to formulate a realistic constitutive model that will enable\nthe Finite Element Method (FEM) compaction simulation in actual production (chapter\n7).\n\n178\n\nChapter 6\nDEM simulations on \u001cred powder\nrefractory materials\nIn this chapter, the mechanical properties of the virtual \u001cred composite (Mix 1) are simulated. For this purpose, DEM triaxial and tensile simulations are performed. Contrary to\nthe green numerical composite, the numerical \u001cred composite is characterized by elastic\nbond connections between \u001cne alumina particles, representing the \u001cred matrix. In section\n6.3, the principal input DEM parameters are presented, and the qualitative e\u001bect of the\nbond strength in shear and tension during triaxial simulations is described. The mechanical behavior at the \u001cring stage is evaluated by comparing stress-strain curves from triaxial\ncompression tests, and the fracture stress from tensile simulations and Brazilian experiments. The cracks (during tensile simulation) develop mostly where the initial damage\nwas located (section 6.4). The yield and ultimate (maximum) stresses are identi\u001ced from\nDEM triaxial and tensile simulations using the same approach used in experiments. The\nyield and ultimate stresses from DEM simulations are plotted in the mean vs. deviatoric\nstress plane, generating the yield and ultimate surfaces, and compared with experimental data (section 6.5). These surfaces generated from DEM are reported in two ways:\ni) comparing experimental data and DEM at a given relative density (of samples previously compacted up to 35 MPa), and ii) at a range of densities (RD=0.8-0.95). Finally,\nwe presented an alternative way to estimate the yield isodensity surface using the same\nmethodology applied in green numerical samples (chapter 5).\n\n179\n\nCHAPTER 6.

DEM SIMULATIONS ON FIRED POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\n\n6.2 Introduction\nThe manufacturing of continuous steel casting refractories comprises the following steps:\npowder mixing, compaction, curing, and \u001cring (chapter 2). Thus, modeling the processing steps can be helpful for the computer-aided design of new materials. To this aim,\nin this Ph.D., the discrete element modeling was divided into two parts: 1) the densi\u001ccation/compaction behavior study of four di\u001berent composites (chapter 5), and 2) the\nanalyzes of the mechanical response of the standard composite (mix 1) after the virtual\nring (this chapter).\nTo our knowledge, the discrete element modeling of \u001cred refractory composites has\nnot yet been reported. Some authors [Olmos et al., 2009] [Martin et al., 2015] performed\nDEM simulations for the sintering modeling of powders considering di\u001busion mechanisms.\nHowever, in our case, there is no thermally induced microstructure transformation. The\nvirtual \u001cring in our work was represented by the addition of elastic bonds to all particles\nin contact. Because part of the binder is burn-out during the \u001cring (chapter 3), the\nmatrix in DEM is represented by \u001cne alumina particles linked by bonds. Successively,\nto reproduce the binder 'bell-e\u001bect' (chapter 3), pairs of bonds are broken between \u001cne\nalumina particles and \u001cne alumina\u0015graphite particles.\nFiring introduces defects (microcracks and decohesions) to alumina-carbon composites,\nthus degrading their mechanical properties, compared with curing, for example, where\nthere is still some plasticity associated with the binder. These refractory composites are\nquasi-brittle materials submitted to extreme working temperatures, leading to thermal\nshock stresses and crack propagation. The present model enables a good representation\nof the mechanical behavior of the standard powder composite (Mix 1), mainly when\nobserving the stress-strain curves from the triaxial compression tests, bestowing some\ncon\u001cdence to the model.\n\n6.3 Material properties\nThe triaxial and tensile simulations are carried out on \u001cred microstructures by adopting\nthe same DEM input material parameters (chapter 5) as for the green stage (E for the\nmaterial Young's modulus, μ for the particles friction coe\u001ecient, and ν for the Poisson's\nratio), except for Young's modulus of the matrix that was derived from \u001ctting experimental triaxial tests. Since the particles are linked by elastic bonds (except the contacts\nbetween \u001cne alumina particles and \u001cne alumina-graphite particles because we have imposed the fracture of these bonds), the bond strength input parameter plays an important\nrole in the macroscopic stresses. Thus, the bond strength in tension (σN ) and shear (σT )\n182\n\n6.4. Mechanical simulations\n\nwere deduced by \u001ctting to the experimental triaxial compression data (Table 6.1).\nMaterial\nμ (4.5)(4.6) E (GPa) (4.2) ν (4.2) σN (MPa) (4.9) σT (MPa) (4.10)\nCoarse alumina\n0.2\n380\n0.2\n78\n508\nGraphite\n0.2\n35\n0.2\n78\n508\nMatrix\n0.2\n4\n0.2\n78\n508\nTable 6.1: Material parameters used on DEM simulations for the after-\u001cring characterization.\nThe qualitative impact of those DEM bond strength values is presented in Table 6.2.\nThe objective is to highlight the e\u001bect of increasing bond strength in shear (σT ) and\ntension (σN ) on the ultimate axial stress (or maximum stress) when applying di\u001berent\nradial stresses. For this purpose, several triaxial tests were performed at several radial\nstresses and modifying the bond strength. First, the σN remained the same, and the σT is\nincreased by 100 MPa. Afterward, σT remained the same, and only σN was also increased\nby 100 MPa. Table 6.2 exhibits the increase of the composite strength (in percentage)\nwhen increasing the bond strength in shear or in tension. The bond strength in shear has\nmore impact at larger radial stresses (10-60 MPa).\nRadial stress (σx = σy ) (MPa)\nσN (MPa) ⇑\nσT (MPa) ⇑\n0\n↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ (+2.2%) ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ (+2.0%)\n10\n↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ (+1.7%)\n↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ (+3.4%)\n30\n↑ ↑ (1.6%)\n↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ (+4.7%)\n60\n↑ (+1.0%)\n↑ ↑ ↑ (+3.8%)\nTable 6.2: Triaxial test simulations: example of the qualitative impact of the input DEM\nbond strength in shear (σT ) and in tension (σN ) on the maximum macroscopic axial stress\n(σz ) depending on the radial stress applied (σx = σy =0, 10, 30, and 60 MPa).\nσN was \u001cxed at 78 MPa, and σT =508 MPa (Table 6.1). Although σT \u0014σN is not\n\nstandard, this is the best \u001ct with triaxial experimental stress-strain curves (section 6.4.1).\nThe shearing and tensile fracture contacts at the bond level highly depend on the radial\nstresses and the applied bond strength.\n\n6.4 Mechanical simulations\n6.4.1 Triaxial compression tests\nTriaxial compression test simulations on the reference mix 1 are performed after the virtual\nring. Similar to the green simulations, those simulations are carried out by controlling the\naxial strain rate in the z-direction (in compression) with the radial stresses (σx = σy ), also\n183\n\nCHAPTER 6. DEM SIMULATIONS ON FIRED POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\nin compression). Thus, the axial stress increases with the radial stress at the beginning\nof the simulation up to the maximum radial stress, remaining constant. Only the axial\nstress is increased until a maximum value is reached (fracture point).\nAs a reminder, the compacted and \u001cred samples were used on experimental triaxial\ncompression tests at several con\u001cning pressure (or radial stress), varying from 0 to 60\nMPa (chapter 3). Stress-strain curves were compared with DEM triaxial test simulations\nto evaluate the capacity of DEM to represent the mechanical response of such powder\ncomposites after the \u001cring stage. The numerical samples were previously compacted by\nclosed-die con\u001cguration, unloaded, and numerically \u001cred (addition of bonds in all particles\ninto contact and further bond breakage between pairs of particles-see chapter 4). To mimic\nthe experimental tests, a pre-loading test was carried out before the triaxial tests. For this\npurpose, the samples were isostatically compacted up to the condition: σx = σy = σz =5.4\nMPa. During this isostatic compaction, the packing is slightly densi\u001ced (density increase\nby ≈ 0.3%). Also, a few bonds are broken, but their number is very small (≈1.3% of new\nbroken bonds). The pre-loading does not cause any noticeable change in the composite\nmechanical behavior.\nStress-strain curves comparing numerical and experimental tests at radial stresses\nvarying from 0 MPa to 60 MPa are shown in Fig. 6.1. The numerical and actual samples exhibit two characteristic behavior\u0016a \u001crst stage roughly linear, followed by a slight\ntransition to a non-linear curve. The increase of the radial stress leads to a larger sample\ndeformation due to the rearrangement of particles. Indeed, this increase of the deformation\nis accompanied by an increased composite densi\u001ccation (RD increase). The stress-strain\ncurves from triaxial DEM simulations and experiments showed a good agreement giving\nsome con\u001cdence in the ability of DEM to represent the macroscopic mechanical behavior\nof the reference powder composite (mix 1) after \u001cring. Recall that the numerical microstructures used for triaxial tests in the \u001cred state all come from the DEM simulations\nof closed-die compaction and unloading.\nFig. 6.1 shows that at small radial stresses (0-10MPa) the agreement between DEM\nand experiments is quite satisfactory. Both curves show a bell shape with maximum\nstress. However, at larger radial stresses (>15MPa), the agreement is not so good. This\nmight be because we had to chose a larger shear strength (σT =508MPa) so that DEM\nan experimental stress-strain curves could \u001ct. DEM clearly shows a maximum stress, but\nstill too much bonds are breaking in tension and in shear (Fig. 6.2). This might be an\nindication that our bond breaking model (Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10), chapter 4) might be too\nsimplistic. Other fracture criterion may lead to a better agreement (e.g., Rankine criteria)\n[Hamelin et al., 2021].\nThe evolution of the number of broken bonds in shear (NruptT ) and in tension (NruptN )\n184\n\n6.4. Mechanical simulations\n\nFigure 6.1: Axial stress-strain curves from triaxial compression tests: comparison between\nexperiments and DEM simulations (radial stress from 0 to 60 MPa).\n\nversus the packing relative density (RD) is shown in Fig. 6.2. It also highlights those\nnumbers at several triaxial compression tests with a variation in the radial stresses (σx =\nσy =0 → 120 MPa). The initial total number of non-broken bonds is ≈ 315,000 and\nbroken bonds ≈ 50,000 (before triaxial tests).\nThe number of broken bonds during the pre-loading cannot be visualized in this scale\nbecause the number of broken bonds is approximately 103 smaller than the other simulations. Since the bond strength in tension is much smaller than in shear (σN =78 MPa,\nσT =508 MPa), the samples present more fractured bonds in tension than in shear. In\nFig. 6.2, the curves in graphs a) and b) are plotted up to the point where the packing\nhas reached the maximum axial stress.\nAs shown in Fig.6.2 a), there is not a signi\u001ccant di\u001berence in the number of broken\nbonds in tension for radial stresses varying between 0 and 120 MPa, with minimum values\naround number=40,000 (at 0 MPa) and maximum of number=88,000 (at 120 MPa). In\n185\n\nCHAPTER 6. DEM SIMULATIONS ON FIRED POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\ncontrast, the number of broken bonds in shear signi\u001ccantly increases with the radial stress\n(Fig. 6.2 b) even if applying a larger bond strength in shear (σT =508 MPa). The increase\nof the radial stresses introduces more shearing at the particle contact. At very large radial\nstress (120 MPa), the number of broken bonds in tension and shear are not so dissimilar\nfrom each other (NruptN ≈ 88,000, and NruptT ≈ 65,000). Whereas at 0 MPa, NruptN ≈\n43,000, and NruptT ≈ 1,900.\nIn other words, Figs. 6.2 a) and b) indicate that at small radial stress (0MPa), a small\nnumber of total broken bonds (shear plus tension) is su\u001ecient to trigger fracture at the\nmacroscopic scale. In contrast, when the radial stress is very large (120MPa), a large\nnumber of broken bonds is necessary to get the fracture.\nIn addition, the evolution of the composite relative density (RD) may present three\nconditions during triaxial compression simulations. The RD may i) decrease, ii) increase\nand further decrease, iii) continuously increase. The type of RD condition will depend\non the magnitude of the applied radial stress. For σT =0, for example, the composite is\ndilating (decrease of RD). By increasing the radial stress, the composite tends to densify\n(RD increase) more easily.\n\nFigure 6.2: a) DEM pre-loading (\u001cnal target: σx = σy = σz = 5.4M P a), and b) triaxial\ntest simulations in samples, with a radial stress between 0 and 90 MPa, at constant\nmacroscopic input parameters: number of broken bonds (in tension and in shear) against\nthe packing relative density (target: maximum axial stress σz = σultimate ). The initial\ntotal number of non-broken bonds is ≈ 315,000 and broken bonds ≈ 50,000.\nExamples of triaxial compression DEM simulations with radial stresses at 0 MPa and\n30 MPa are shown in Fig. 6.3. The microstructure representation of the total number of\nbroken bonds (NruptN +NruptT ) per particle at the maximum axial stress (σz ) are shown.\n186\n\n6.4. Mechanical simulations\n\nThe graphs are plotted as stress-strain plots with the evolution of the total number of\nbroken bonds. The number of broken bonds increases with the axial stress, even after the\nmaximum axial stress point has been reached. At the maximum stress, the total number\nof broken bonds at 0 MPa and 30 MPa is approximately 45,000 and 89,000, which are\ncoming mostly from contacts in tension, as previously seen in Fig. 6.2.\n\nFigure 6.3: Two examples of triaxial compression numerical simulations at a) σx = σy =0\nMPa and b) 30 MPa. Evolution of the total number of broken bonds (NruptN +NruptT )\nin red versus the axial stress-strain. The total number of broken bonds per particle was\nhighlighted when at the maximum axial stress.\nUltimate and yield stresses (DEM and experiment)\nThe evolution of the ultimate and yield stress against the radial stress (or con\u001cning\npressure) of experimental and DEM triaxial compression is shown in Figs. 6.4 a) and\nb). As previously seen in chapter 3, the yield strength from experimental triaxial tests is\nde\u001cned by the 0.02% o\u001bset strain from strain-stress curves. Therefore, this same method\n187\n\nCHAPTER 6. DEM SIMULATIONS ON FIRED POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\nwas also applied for the strain-stress curves from numerical triaxial simulations to compare\nnumerical and experimental data. In Fig. 6.4 c) two examples of stress-strain curves\nfrom a triaxial experimental test and a numerical for radial stresses equivalent to 30\nMPa are plotted, and the yield strength points are highlighted. However, this is, of\ncourse, an assumption. Except for the ultimate (or maximum) stress, it is impossible\nto precisely determine the material yielding point due to its mechanical response and\ntesting complexity. Nonetheless, the ultimate and yield points from numerical triaxial\nsimulations exhibit a good agreement with experiments.\n\nFigure 6.4: a) Evolution of the ultimate and the b) yield axial stresses: comparison\nbetween DEM and experimental triaxial compression tests. c) Stress-strain curves exemplifying the estimation of the axial yield stress (radial stress equal to 30 MPa).\n\n6.4.2 Tensile tests\nTensile test simulations were applied on mix 1 virtual \u001cred samples previously compacted\nuniaxially at 10, 35, ≈ 70 MPa (RD=100%) and unloaded. These tensile simulations\nwere carried out using the same material properties from Table 6.1. A uniaxial tensile\nstrain rate is applied in the z -direction (ε ̇z > 0), and null stresses in x and y directions\n188\n\n6.4. Mechanical simulations\n\n(σx = σy =0) until sample's failure (chapter 3). The tensile strength (maximum axial\nstress) from DEM simulations slightly increases together with the sample density and\nvaries between 1.18-1.72 MPa (Fig.6.5 a). Comparing the tensile strength from numerical\nand real samples compacted at 35 MPa, those values are 1.39 ±0.14 (DEM) and 3.32±0.16\n(experiment). Thus, the tensile strength from DEM underestimates the strength from\nexperimental Brazilian tests. This di\u001berence is likely linked to the more complex stress\nstate (with compressive stress components) in the Brazilian test as compared to the purely\ntensile test in DEM. Also, the boundary conditions in the Brazilian tests are quite di\u001berent\nfrom the periodic boundary conditions used in DEM.\nThe objective of Figs.6.5 c) and d) is to study the evolution of the bonds damage during\nthe tensile simulation. Fig.6.5 c) represents the initial state of broken bonds. Pairs of\nbonds were broken to mimic the voids introduced in the \u001cring process (chapter 4). The two\ngures in sequence (Fig.6.5 d) give the additional bonds damage (not showing the initial\none) evolution during the tensile test when: 1) the sample has reached the maximum\nstress, and 2) after sample fracture. Fig.6.5 e) are zoomed pictures from the previous\nimage to highlight the crack path. It is possible to observe that the cracks develop mostly\nwhere the initial damage was located (around coarse alumina clusters). Some graphite\nbonded particles that are close to the coarse alumina clusters also break.\nThe same problem was observed in [Pizette et al., 2010] where the tensile strength from\nDEM tensile simulations and Brazilian experimental tests were compared using aggregate\npowder ceramic materials (DEM strength was underestimating experimental values). In\nPizette et al., a contact fracture stress parameter (σf ) was used to describe the cohesion\nbetween the particles. In our work, the bond strength is the parameter that dictates the\ntensile strength in DEM.\n\n189\n\nCHAPTER 6.

In this section, meandeviatoric surfaces are generated from the triaxial compression and tensile test simulations. The objective is to evaluate the material fracture-yield surfaces shape and compare\nit with experimental data.\nThese surfaces are reported as functions of mean P = − 13 (σx +σy +σz )) and deviatoric\n(Q = |σz − (1/2(σx + σy ))|) stresses for the triaxial tests (DEM and experiment) and\nuniaxial tensile simulations (DEM). Concerning the Brazilian tests, P = (2σz )/3 and\n√\nQ = 13σz (Martin et al. [2000]). The P-Q stresses from triaxial tests are plotted in the\npositive quadrant.\nFig. 6.6 shows the ultimate and yield surfaces (P-Q) comparison between DEM simulations and experimental data (Mix 1). In DEM, the ultimate surface reefers to the\nmaximum axial stress (σz ) from the triaxial stress-strain curves (Fig. 6.1 and from tensile\n190\n\n6.5. Generation of the yield and ultimate surfaces\n\nstress-strain curves (Fig. 6.5 b). The deviatoric stress above 60 MPa of radial stress\n(σx = σy ) is almost constant as the di\u001berence between the maximum axial stress and the\nradial stress is ≈ 72-79 MPa. Thus, the deviatoric stress at the ultimate surface is never\nnull (Fig. 6.6 a). The DEM ultimate surface is plotted up to a triaxial simulation with\nσx = σy =120 MPa. Concerning the yield surface (Fig. 6.6 b), the determination of the\nyield stress from those stress-strain curves is not trivial.\n\nFigure 6.6: Deviatoric-mean stress (in modulus) of mix 1: comparison between experiments and DEM simulations for a) the ultimate surface (maximum stresses) b) yield\nsurface.\nThe P-Q ultimate surfaces from DEM simulations of mix 1 composite numerical samples, previously compacted by closed-die con\u001cguration up to di\u001berent densities (from\nRD=0.8 to 0.958), are shown in Fig. 6.7. The last RD refers to the sample compacted\nup to a target of axial stress equal to 35 MPa. The \u001ctting of the yield/damage model\nof Bigoni-Piccolroaz model to the DEM generated surfaces for di\u001berent densities are presented in the Appendix E.\n\n191\n\nCHAPTER 6. DEM SIMULATIONS ON FIRED POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\n\nFigure 6.7: Deviatoric-mean stress (in modulus): ultimate surfaces depending on the\npacking density (RDcomp. =density reached at the \u001cnal of the compaction).\n\n6.6 Additional method for the generation of fracture\nand isodensity yield surfaces\nWe have seen in the previous section that estimating the yield stress is di\u001ecult. Because\nit is not possible to predict with certainty the material yield point, an alternative way\nto estimate the yield material surface is proposed (Fig. 6.8). In this example, the yield\ncontour is represented by the connection between isodensity points (RD=95.8%), i.e.,\nwhen the sample is at the same density from the end of compaction. With this method, the\npoint with the largest value of mean stress (P) is characterized by a zero deviatoric stress\n(σx = σy = σz ). The fracture points are considered as the maximum axial stress point\ntogether with the sample relative density decrease. Similar to chapter 5, by increasing\nthe radial stress, the sample may experience fracture or densi\u001ccation. In other words,\nthe transition between the fracture and isodensity surface is when the sample densi\u001ces\n(increase in RD). This same methodology was applied in chapter 5 for generating fracture\nand yield surfaces for the green stage.\nThree conditions may apply during triaxial simulation tests, which depend on the\napplied radial stresses. First, the packing may fracture (detected from the maximum axial\nstress together with a sample RD decrease). Second, by increasing the radial stresses\n(σx = σy =30 MPa), the packing may \u001crst densify and further fracture (RD decrease\ntogether with the maximum stress), as shown in Fig. 6.8 b). Or, third, only densi\u001ced\n(RD increase). This last condition meets mostly on simulations with higher radial stresses\n(σx = σy >80 MPa), as shown in Fig. 6.8 c). These two stresses (fracture and isodensity\n192\n\n6.6. Additional method for the generation of fracture and isodensity yield surfaces\n\nFigure 6.8: a) Deviatoric vs. mean stresses (fracture and isodensity surface). b) Triaxial\ncompression test (radial stress of 30 MPa). The fracture point is the maximum axial stress\ntogether with a sample relative density decrease. c) Triaxial compression test (radial stress\nof 90 MPa). The isodensity point is when the sample is at the same density from the\ncompaction end (RD=95.8%).\npoints) are represented by the number 1) and 2) in the mean-deviatoric stress plane Fig.\n6.8 a).\nThe comparison between two methods used to generate the DEM surfaces in the mean\nvs. deviatoric stresses is shown in Fig. 6.9. The fracture points coincide with the ultimate\nsurface (Fig. 6.9). Contrary to the yield surface, increasing the radial stress, we observe\na transition from the fracture to the isodensity surface (sample densi\u001ccation) until Q=0.\nHowever, it is di\u001ecult to fully validate this methodology since no work has been published using this method for \u001cred samples yet. The fracture-isodensity contour resembles\nsomewhat the yield/damage curve shape from the model proposed by Bigoni and Piccolroaz model [Bigoni & Piccolroaz, 2004] which presents mostly a convex shape, di\u001berently\nfrom the green isodensity contour that has a concave shape (chapter 5).\n\n193\n\nCHAPTER 6. DEM SIMULATIONS ON FIRED POWDER REFRACTORY\nMATERIALS\n\nFigure 6.9: Comparison between the two methods applied to generate surfaces from DEM\nsimulations in the mean vs. deviatoric stress plane: a) yield and ultimate surfaces, and\nb) fracture and isodensity surfaces.\n\n6.7 Conclusions\nIn this chapter, an original approach to investigate the potential of DEM for simulating the mechanical behavior of virtual \u001cred reference refractory composite (mix 1) was\npresented. The numerical microstructures tested in this chapter originated from the compacted samples investigated in the preceding chapter 5. We decided to focus on the DEM\nring evaluation only for the reference composite to demonstrate the potentiality of the\nmethod. The same approach could, of course, be used for the other mixes.\nFirst, the qualitative impact of the bond strength on the composite macroscopic behavior through triaxial compression simulations was presented in section 6.3. The \u001ct\nbetween experiments and simulations showed that larger bond strength is necessary for\nshear compared to the bond strength in tension. The consequence is that the number of\nbroken bonds in tension is larger than in shear. Increasing the radial stresses in x and y\ndirections introduces a larger shearing at the particle contacts. Thus, the number of broken bonds in shear is signi\u001ccantly increased with the rise of the radial stresses. However,\nthe change in the radial stresses seemed to not signi\u001ccantly a\u001bects the number of broken\nbonds in shear, which remained approximately the same in all simulations.\nIt is not clear why σT needs to be signi\u001ccantly larger than σN . Still, with this choice\nof bond strength, stress-strain curves from triaxial compression numerical simulations\nwere compared with experimental data showing a good agreement. This gives some con194\n\n6.7. Conclusions\n\ndence in the ability of DEM to model the mechanical behavior of after-\u001cred samples.\nThe stress-strain curves exhibit two characteristic behaviors. The \u001crst is a roughly linear\nshape. The second is a transition to pseudo-plastic behavior due to the rearrangement\nof particles (the model does not allow plastic deformation at the \u001cring). Larger radial\nstresses lead to larger deformation as a consequence of the sample densi\u001ccation. Regarding the tensile numerical simulations, the DEM ultimate axial stress (or fracture\npoint) underestimates the experimental data points. This di\u001berence in the stress is due\nto the complex loading conditions applied in the Brazilian test (experiment) with some\ncompression stress components that are not rendered by a simple uniaxial DEM tensile\nsimulation.\nThe ultimate and the yield surfaces (P-Q) were generated from triaxial compression\nand uniaxial tensile DEM simulations. The ultimate surface is referent to the connection\nof maximum axial stress points and the yield surface from yield axial stress points (i.e.,\no\u001bset 0.02% strain). Similar to experiments, the ultimate and yield surfaces never reach\na condition where the deviatoric stress equals zero (Q=0). The yield function represents\na single, convex and smooth surface in stress space approaching as limit situations wellknown [Bigoni & Piccolroaz, 2004]. We presented an alternative way to estimate the yield\nsurface contour so that Q=0. This methodology was applied in chapter 5 by connecting\nisodensity points (RD at the \u001cnal of the compaction). No previous work has been shown\nthe ability of DEM to connect isodensity points to represent the yield locus for refractory\ncomposite materials after the \u001cring yet. The surfaces may be further compared with the\nyield/damage model (Appendix E), introduced by Bigoni and Piccolroaz (BP) [Bigoni &\nPiccolroaz, 2004] [Piccolroaz et al., 2006] [Argani et al., 2016]. The BP model is used by\nVESUVIUS to simulate the thermo-mechanical behavior of powder composites using a\nnite element code.\n\n195\n\nChapter 7\nFinite element modeling\nIn this chapter, we use the information gathered by DEM simulations to implement a\nconstitutive equation for the refractory composites into a Finite Element code. The aim\nof this chapter is to provide an example of the possibilities o\u001bered by the mutual use of the\ndiscrete and \u001cnite element methods (DEM and FEM) for the simulation of an industrial\nVesuvius compaction process. In more detail, the \u001ctting of the isodensity and fracture\npoints, generated from DEM simulations (chapter 5) of green samples (mix 1), with the\nDrucker-Prager Cap (DPC) model are shown. The DPC model parameters are identi\u001ced\n(section 7.3). Finite element compaction using a closed-die con\u001cguration is described in\nsection 7.4 using the DPC model. The main objectives are \u001crst to calibrate complementary parameters not identi\u001ced by closed-die compaction experimental tests (composite\nPoisson's ratio and friction). Second, to validate the measured DPC parameters. The\nresulting density distribution within the powder composite inside the die is obtained.\nThe evolution of the compaction pressure vs. the composite relative density during FEM\nnumerical simulation and is compared to experimental closed-die compaction results. Finally, the distribution of the Von Mises (Q) and the hydrostatic stress (P) inside the die\nis highlighted. The loading path during closed-die compaction is plotted in the P vs. Q\nplane, comparing numerical (DEM and FEM) data.\n\n197\n\nCHAPTER 7.

These industrial parts are shaped by the powder compaction process uniaxially\nor isostatically. The compaction may induce a density gradient in the \u001cnal part leading to thermo-mechanical properties di\u001berences along with the piece and consequently\nto cracking phenomena and material damage. Therefore, better homogeneity should be\nachieved by optimizing the part geometry. Understanding powder compaction behavior\nis of practical importance to improve product development e\u001eciency and manufacturing\nperformance.\nAs a recall, the green characterization in this Ph.D. was divided into three parts: experimental testing, DEM, and FEM simulations (Fig. 7.1). First, experimental closed-die\ncompaction and triaxial/uniaxial compression tests were performed on refractory composites (chapter 3). A DEM model was used to describe the compaction behavior and\nmechanical behavior. These DEM simulations were calibrated and compared with experimental data. In other words, the green DEM composite (after compaction) was submitted\nto a series of mechanical simulations (tensile, uniaxial/triaxial compression tests) to generate the isodensity and the fracture surfaces of green numerical samples (mix 1). These\nsurfaces can be \u001ctted with the Drucker\u0015Prager Cap model (DPC), which is currently\ncommonly used for modeling compaction of metal powders [Almanstötter, 2015] [Zhou\net al., 2017], ceramic powders [Abdullah et al., 2009] and for application to pharmaceutical powders [Michrafy et al., 2002] [Michrafy et al., 2004] [Kadiri et al., 2005] [Han et al.,\n199\n\nCHAPTER 7. FINITE ELEMENT MODELING\n2008]. The DPC model parameters are calculated and presented in the section 7.3. The\nadvantage of DEM is that these surfaces are di\u001ecult to obtain from experiments due\nto the complex mechanical behavior of the green composite. Also, if an experimental\nprogram is able to provide these surfaces, it needs to be repeated for each new powder.\nThese parameters are implemented in ABAQUS (FEM commercial software) with density\ndependant evolution to simulate the composite compaction response in closed-die con\u001cguration. The FEM results are then compared with experimental data. The objective is\nto calibrate some properties not identi\u001ced in the closed-die compaction experiment (mix\nPoisson's ratio and friction coe\u001ecient) and to validate the DPC parameters (section 7.4).\n\nFigure 7.1: Schematic of the validation of the Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC) model. Experimental closed-die compaction data → DEM (generation of the isodentity yield surface\nand fracture line) → DPC model parameters identi\u001ccation → FEA modeling (closed-die\ncompaction con\u001cguration).\n\n7.3 Parameters identi\u001ccation (DPC model) from DEM\nsimulations\nThe Drucker-Prager Cap model (DPC) is commonly used to model the elasto-plastic\nbehavior of powders, assuming the material is porous, compressible, and isotropic. The\nmodel describes the yielding of the material as a function of the hydrostatic stress (P)\nand the Von Mises (Q) equivalent stress. The DPC model is composed of a shear failure\nsurface and a cap. The isodensity and fracture points generated from DEM simulations\nand plotted in the P vs. Q plane (chapter 5) are \u001ctted with a line and a convex contour\nto identify the DPC model parameters. As a recall, the discrete packings were compacted\nby closed-die, unloaded, and reloaded (triaxial compressive and tensile test simulations).\nThese reloading points were plotted in the P vs. Q plane, forming the fracture and the\nisodensity points (chapter 5). The fracture DEM points are \u001ctted with the shear failure\n200\n\n7.3. Parameters identi\u001ccation (DPC model) from DEM simulations\n\nsurface and the DEM isodensity points with the cap (Fig. 7.2). To cover a large range of\ndensities, the DPC surfaces are plotted for densities between 0.7 and 1.\n\nFigure 7.2: Drucker-Prager Cap model: Von mises equivalent stress against the hydrostatic pressure of mix 1 composite compacted (by closed-die con\u001cguration) up to densities\nvarying from 0.7 to 1. The model is represented by a failure line and the yield surface.\nFig. 7.3 exempli\u001ces the identi\u001ccation of the DPC model parameters for a shear failure\nand cap surfaces of the packing at RD=0.95. Using the Abaques vocabulary associated\nto the DPC parameters, the shape of the cap surface is determined by the yield pressure\n(pb ), the cohesion (d), the evolution pressure (pa ), the cap eccentricity (R), and the angle\nof friction (β ). The linear shear failure surface function depends on d and β . Concerning\nthe calibration of the DPC parameters, \u001crst, the cohesion is identi\u001ced from the linear\nfunction (y = (tan β) · x + d = 0). The pressure pa , pb and the eccentricity (R) can\nbe \u001ctted to the numerical DEM points. The evolution of the DPC parameters (cohesion,\n201\n\nCHAPTER 7. FINITE ELEMENT MODELING\nangle of friction, cap eccentricity, evolution pressure, yield pressure, and Young's modulus)\nagainst the relative density are shown in Figs. 7.4 a-f).\n\nFigure 7.3: Typical representation of the identi\u001ccation of the Drucker-Prager Cap model\nparameters (isodensity RD=0.95).\nIn addition to the DPC cap model parameters, the FEM simulation needs Young's\nmodulus and a Poisson's ratio. The powder Young's modulus is estimated from DEM\nuniaxial compression (crush) tests. These tests were carried out on compacted Mix 1\nsamples at di\u001berent relative densities (0.7-1). Concerning the Poisson's ratio, we will see\nin the next section how we calibrate this value for the powder.\n\n202\n\n7.4. Closed-die compaction con\u001cguration (lab scale)\n\nFigure 7.4: Drucker-Prager Cap model parameters: a) cohesion (d), b) angle of friction\n(β ), c) cap eccentricity (R), d) pressure evolution (pa ), e) hydrostatic pressure yield\nsurface (pb ), f) mix 1 Young's modulus (estimated from DEM uniaxial compression test\nsimulations).\n\n7.4 Closed-die compaction con\u001cguration (lab scale)\nThe material parameters from the Drucker Prager Cap model, identi\u001ced in the previous\nsection (Fig. 7.4), are used in ABAQUS to simulate the compaction of the reference\nrefractory composite (mix 1) in a closed-die con\u001cguration. The compaction is modeled in a\n2D axisymmetric model. Linear quad elements (CAX4R) with increasing mesh density are\nemployed in the mix part (Fig. 7.5 b) and a more coarse mesh in the rest of the part (punch\nand die). The main objectives of this simulation using the \u001cnite element method are\nrst to calibrate complementary parameters not identi\u001ced by experiments (mix Poisson's\nratio and friction coe\u001ecient). Second, to validate the DPC model parameters previously\ncalculated from DEM mechanical tests.\nPunch and die are represented by an alloy steel 42CrMo4 (see properties in Table 7.1).\nThe major part of the powder material properties is referent to the DPC model (section\n7.3). The powder Young's modulus was calculated from DEM uniaxial compression tests\nof compacted numerical samples at di\u001berent densities (Fig. 7.4 f). The powder Poisson's\nratio and the friction coe\u001ecient are calibrated and represented as best \u001ct properties\n(compared with experimental data). The friction coe\u001ecient at the mix/die interface is\nequal to 0.1. The Poisson's ratio increases with the powder relative density (0.38-0.39).\n203\n\nCHAPTER 7. FINITE ELEMENT MODELING\n\nFigure 7.5: Finite element closed-die compaction simulation (mix 1). Density distribution: a) before the compaction, and b) at the end of compaction. c) mesh representation\n(initial state, before compaction).\n\nThese Poisson's values are consistent with previous FEM compaction simulations carried\nout in VESUVIUS in a very similar powder composite, where the \u001ctted Poisson's ratio is\nalso between 0.38 and 0.39.\nMaterial\nE (GPa) Poisson's ratio Mass density (kg/m3 )\nSteel\n205\n0.29\n7850\nMix 1 (reference) 0.02-0.1\n0.38-0.39\n1776-2960\nTable 7.1: Steel (punch and die) and composite (mix 1) elastic material properties used\non FEM closed-die compaction.

Closed-die compaction con\u001cguration (lab scale)\n\n(as well as the powder Young's modulus). The measured Poisson's ratio increases with the\napplied axial stress, and consequently with the relative density (Fig. 7.6). The measured\nPoisson's ratio from DEM is approximately 0.4 at RD=95% (35 MPa) which represents a\ngood agreement with the value \u001ctted in the FEM closed-die compaction simulation. The\nlist of all DPC model parameters added in ABAQUS is listed in Appendix C.\n\nFigure 7.6: Evolution of the Poisson's ratio against the relative density during DEM\nclosed-die compaction simulation until axial stress of 35 MPa.\nThe \u001clling mix is compacted by the upper punch with a displacement boundary condition starting from a height of 60 mm. Similar to the compaction experiment, only the\ntop punch moves (single action pressing) . The diameter of the punch is 30mm. A userde\u001cned \u001celd is used (USDLFD), which is updated each time step using the volumetric\nplastic strain (εpl\nvol ), to include the dependency of DPC parameters with the evolution of\nRD\n) (Eq. (2.8),\nthe relative density (RD). The volumetric plastic strain is equal to ln( RD\n0\nchapter 2). RD is the \u001cnal relative density, and RD0 is the initial (RD0 =0.6). The\nuser-de\u001cned subroutine USDLFD is shown in the Appendix D.\n\n7.4.1 Density distribution\nThe resulting distribution of relative density after compaction at a compaction pressure\nof 35MPa is shown in Fig. 7.7 a). The compaction pressure shown in the curve is the\naverage contact pressure (CPRESS) at the interface mix/upper punch. CPRESS is a\nvariable \u001celd output request for general contact in ABAQUS/Explicit. This variable is\ncalculated as the magnitude of the net contact normal force (the CNORMF vector) per\nunit area (it is an unsigned value) [Abaqus, 2006]. The contact pressure from ABAQUS is\nthe stress that is the most similar to the compaction pressure measured in the experimental\nclosed-die compaction. The density distribution map exhibits a larger density at the top\n205\n\nCHAPTER 7. FINITE ELEMENT MODELING\ncorner and the lowest at the bottom corner because of the displacement of the upper\npunch. This density gradient is more signi\u001ccant at the interface mix/die because of the\nfriction coe\u001ecient. The maximum and minimum relative density, at 35 MPa, are ≈ 99%\n(top) and 94% (bottom). The heterogeneous density map obtained from single action\ndie compaction due to the friction with the die has been observed experimentally [Yanai\net al., 1995] [Fruhstorfer & Aneziris, 2017], and using numerical simulations [Kim et al.,\n2000] [?] [Wu et al., 2005]. The density map that we obtain in Fig. 7.7 a) is in good\nqualitative agreement with these studies. In particular, we reproduce the e\u001bect of the\nfriction between the powder and the die at the corners of the sample.\n\nFigure 7.7: a) Relative density distribution in the die during FEM closed-die compaction.\nb) Axial stress (or compaction pressure) versus relative density curves: comparison between numerical and experimental data. The RD from FEM was measured as the average\ndensity of each element.\nThe compaction pressure evolution versus relative density curves of closed-die compaction simulations (DEM and FEM) and experiment is presented in Fig. 7.7 b). A\ngood qualitative and quantitative agreement between the experimental and FEM curves\nis observed. The fact that the DEM curve is very similar to the FEM one is encouraging.\nHowever, care should be taken when comparing DEM and FEM compaction simulations\nas the boundary conditions are quite dissimilar. In DEM, we consider a fully periodic condition, and the macroscopic stresses are calculated from Love's formulation (Eqn. (4.13),\nchapter 4). In FEM, there is strong interaction between the powder and the die/punch\n(coe\u001ecient of friction). Also, similar to the experiments, in FEM, the motion is given\nonly by the top punch (in the y-axis). In DEM, both the top and bottom sides of the\n206\n\n7.4. Closed-die compaction con\u001cguration (lab scale)\n\nperiodic cell move (in the z-axis).\n\n7.4.2 Distribution of the Von Mises stress and hydrostatic pressure in the die\nThe equivalent Von Mises stress is calculated as:\n1\n2\n2\n2 1/2\n+ τyz\n+ τzx\n)]\nQ = √ [(σx − σy )2 + (σy − σz )2 + (σz − σx )2 + 6(τxy\n2\n\n(7.1)\n\nwhere σx , σy , and σz are the principal stresses. τxy , τyz , and τzx are the shear stresses.\nThe Hydrostatic stress is given by:\n1\nP = − (σx + σy + σz )\n3\n\n(7.2)\n\nFigs. 7.8 a-1) and a-2) show the evolution of the axial and radial stresses, respectively,\nversus the relative density from FEM and DEM simulations. The curves (1), (2), and\n(3) are correlated to the tagged nodes in three di\u001berent regions of the powder. These\nregions are highlighted in Fig. 7.8 b) which also exhibits the axial stress distribution\nalong with the powder at a compaction pressure of 35 MPa. The maximum (1), middle\n(3), and minimum (2) nodes correspond to a relative density of ≈ 99%, 96.7%, and 94%,\nrespectively, at 35MPa (Fig. 7.7 a).\nNode 1 experiences the largest axial stress during compaction. This is a direct e\u001bect\nof the relative motion between the die and the powder, which is at its maximum at the\ntop right corner of the sample. Friction between the die and the powder is thus increasing\nthe local stress necessary to plastically deform the powder at this location. The reverse\nis true for node 2, which experiences very small relative motion. Node 3 is both further\naway from the cylindrical die and from the two \u001dat pistons.\nAlthough the axial stress is clearly a\u001bected by the location in the sample, Fig. 7.8\na-2) indicates that the radial stress is nearly independent of the location.\nThe DEM simulations use full periodic conditions. The direct comparison with FEM\nsimulations introducing die geometrical e\u001bects and frictional e\u001bects between the die and\nthe powder is not fully meaningful. Still, we note that the stress evolution of node 3, which\nis at the center of the sample and further away from the e\u001bect of the cylindrical die and\nfrom the e\u001bect of the punches, is in a fairly good agreement with the DEM simulations.\nThe Von Mises equivalent stress (Q) and hydrostatic pressure (P ) during the compaction numerical simulations (DEM and FEM) are calculated using Eqn's. (7.1) and\n(7.2) above. The distribution of the Q and the P of the powder inside the die, at the\nend of the closed-die compaction at a compaction pressure (CPRESS) of 35 MPa, is given\n207\n\nCHAPTER 7.

Maximum stresses are highlighted in the top corner (node 1)\nbecause this region is over-compacted (RD ≈ 99%). Node 1 is the most critical point\nbecause it is the one closest to the failure line and during the unloading it might appear\nsome tensile stresses, leading to material failure. The lowest stresses are at the bottom\ncorner in the under-pressed region (RD ≈ 94%). The non-uniform stress distribution is\nexhibited mostly in the interface mix/die due to the friction coe\u001ecient.\nFig. 7.9 c) shows the DPC surfaces and the loading path performed during closeddie simulations (DEM and FEM) until a compaction pressure of 35 MPa. Also, the\nunloading path of the DEM simulation is exhibited. The curves (1), (2), and (3) are\ncorrelated to the tagged nodes in three di\u001berent regions of the powder. To note, these\nnodes are the same from the highlighted in the previous Fig. 7.8 b).

Indeed, the nodes exhibit\na Q of between 6.3MPa and 19MPa, and a P of around 14MPa and 30MPa.\nThe stresses di\u001berences between the FEM simulations and DEM come from the axial\nand radial stresses. The di\u001berence between the axial and radial stresses in FEM are larger\nthan in DEM, increasing the Mises stress during the FEM compaction simulations.\nThe triangles highlighted in Fig. 7.9 c) represent the points (P, Q) at a compaction\npressure of 35MPa (CPRESS in FEM and σz in DEM). It is observed a reasonable good\naccordance of relative density with the DPC surfaces. For example, the RD at 35MPa\n(node 1) is equal to ≈ 99% and is between the density surfaces of 98% and 100%. The\nsame was observed for nodes (2) and (3).\n209\n\nCHAPTER 7. FINITE ELEMENT MODELING\n\n7.5 Conclusions\nIn this chapter, we presented a \u001crst attempt of modeling the powder composite (mix\n1) closed-die compaction using a \u001cnite element code (ABAQUS), applying the DruckerPrager Cap (DPC) model.\nFor this purpose, \u001crst, the DEM fracture and isodensity points plotted in the P vs. Q\nplane (chapter 5) are \u001ctted with a shear failure surface and a cap. This \u001ctting allowed the\nidenti\u001ccation of the DPC model parameters. The shape of the failure surface and the cap\nare very sensitive to the parameters. The shape of the cap depends on the yield stress,\ncohesion, evolution pressure, cap eccentricity, and angle of friction. In contrast, the shear\nfailure surface depends on the cohesion and the angle of friction.\nSecond, the FEM closed-die compaction simulation uses the DPC model to de\u001cne\nthe powder material properties. The compaction pressure evolution against the relative\ndensity of the FEM numerical simulation and experiment has shown a good agreement.\nAlso, the DEM curve has shown a very similar behavior compared to FEM and experiment,\nwhich is encouraging. However, it is important to mention that care must be taken when\ncomparing DEM and FEM compaction simulations since the boundary conditions are\nvery di\u001berent. In DEM, the model uses a fully periodic condition that does not take\ninto account the real die geometry nor the frictional e\u001bects between the powder and the\ndie. In FEM, there is an interaction between the powder and the die/punch (coe\u001ecient\nof friction). Also, similar to the experiments, in FEM, the motion is given only by the\ntop punch (in the y-axis). In DEM, both the top and bottom sides of the periodic cell\nmove (in the z-axis). The density distribution map was more signi\u001ccant in the interface\npowder/die because of the friction coe\u001ecient. A maximum density was exhibited in the\ntop right corner and a lower density in the bottom corner.\nFinally, the Von Mises (Q) and hydrostatic (P) stresses distribution in the die are\nexhibited. Also, the loading path during the numerical closed-die compaction simulations\n(DEM and FEM) in the P vs. Q plane are plotted and compared. The Von Mises stress\nfrom DEM is smaller than from FEM simulations because the axial and radial stresses\nin DEM are larger. Consequently, the di\u001berence between the axial and radial stresses in\nFEM is larger. For more accurate analyzes, additional experimental closed-die compaction\nmay be carried out measuring the radial stress in the die (e.g., using strain gages). So,\nthe P vs. Q stresses from experiments may also be plotted and compared with numerical\nsimulations.\nThis chapter should be seen as a proof of concept of the methodology that can be\nused in an industrial setting to couple experiments, DEM and FEM. The methodology\nwas exempli\u001ced here on Mix 1 and a simplistic cylindrical geometry. The advantage of\n210\n\n7.5.

Conclusions\n\n8.1 Conclusions\nCarbon-bonded alumina refractories are very heterogeneous composites made of a mixture\nbetween a soft binder and hard particles (alumina and graphite). Understanding the relationship between the microstructure, compaction behavior, and mechanical properties is\nessential to developing new refractory products and optimizing new powder compositions.\nThe literature review presented in chapter 2 provided an insight into the current\nunderstanding of the compaction behavior, and the mechanical and thermo-mechanical\nproperties of ceramic powders and refractory composites, combining both numerical and\nexperimental techniques. The numerical simulations were described using the Discrete\nElement Method (DEM) and the Finite Element Method (FEM). DEM is a powerful tool\nthat can link the microstructure of powder materials with their compaction behavior and\nmechanical properties. However, the use of DEM to model refractory materials is quite\nrecent ([M. H. Moreira et al., 2020] and [Ramírez-Aragón et al., 2020]). As far as we\nknow, no work has been published yet concerning the modeling of commercial refractory\ncomposites, such as carbon-bonded alumina, using DEM simulations.\nThis thesis aimed at modeling the compaction behavior and the mechanical properties\nof VESUVIUS carbon-bonded alumina composites using numerical simulations (chapters\n4 to 7) coupled with experiments (chapter 3). The numerical modeling was divided into\na micro-scale using DEM (considering the particulate matter of the composite powder),\npresented in chapters 4 to 6. And, on the macro-scale, using data generated by DEM\nto simulate the closed-die compaction considering the powder composite as continuum\nmatter using a \u001cnite element code (chapter 7).\nIn this Ph.D. work, an original approach was developed using the discrete numerical\nmodel based on a Representative Volume Element (RVE) to represent the microstructure\nof carbon-bonded alumina refractory compositions. Seeking simplicity, we have chosen\nto represent coarse alumina as spherical in DEM. The graphite in DEM was represented\nby rectangular geometry but with no shape variation. The real composite microstructure\nis characterized by irregular coarse alumina grains and graphite pellets embedded into\na matrix (\u001cne alumina grains and binder). Four compositions were studied with variations on the volume fraction of each component. The composite in DEM was modeled\nby a mixture of single \u001cne particles and bonded particle clusters (coarse alumina and\ngraphite). Two contact models were used and described in chapter 4. We have also shown\nthe importance of carefully choosing the number of discrete elements to ensure a good\ncompromise between CPU time and model accuracy.\nCoarse and \u001cne alumina hard particles were coated by an elastoplastic soft binder coreshell on DEM (chapter 4) at the compaction and green stage (Fig. 8.1 a). The aim of this\n215\n\nCHAPTER 8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nmodel was to represent in a simpli\u001ced manner the presence of a soft shell covering hard\nparticles. The number of particles was calculated based on the volume fraction of each\ncomponent (\u001cne/coarse alumina particles, graphite, and binder) on the composition. We\nhave shown that the macroscopic compaction behavior of the composite depends mostly\non the binder content.\nIn other words, the macroscopic stress needed to attain a given relative density increases with a decreasing binder shell thickness (related with its volume fraction) and\nbinder sti\u001bness (Fig. 8.1 b). During the unloading (after compaction), the soft binder\nshell in DEM is responsible for the composite hysteresis e\u001bect, which increases with the\ncontacts in the soft phase (chapter 5). The number of contacts in the soft or hard phases\ndepends on these two mechanisms: binder thickness and sti\u001bness. In other words, the\nbinder results in the introduction of plasticity to the composite during the unloading.\nThe graphite deforms during the compaction (bonds are broken), also contributing to the\ncomposite plastic response. Similar to the graphite, the coarse alumina was modeled as\nbonded particles cluster; however, they do not deform (bonds are never broken).\n\nFigure 8.1: a) Representation of the discrete numerical sample of heterogeneous carbonbonded refractory composites b) Evolution of the axial stress vs. relative density of\nclosed-die compaction numerical simulations performed in this Ph.D. work.\nThis work has shown a good agreement in the densi\u001ccation behavior (axial stress\nvs. relative density curve) between DEM and experimental closed-die compaction data\n(Fig. 8.2 a) and also for the other compositions. When plotting the same curve in the\nlogarithm scale (Fig. 8.2 b), the stages I and II referent to the grains rearrangement\nand plastic deformation, characteristic of general powder ceramics compaction behavior\n(chapter 2), may be identi\u001ced in both experiments and DEM simulations. However, stage\nIII (fracture) could not be identi\u001ced. In some cases, it might be di\u001ecult to determine the\ntransition between stages II and III. In addition, the beginning of the compaction curves\nfrom numerical and experimental tests exhibit a di\u001berence in terms of initial relative\n216\n\n8.1. Conclusions\n\ndensity. This di\u001berence is explained since, in DEM, the packing has started to compact\nat 60%. Instead, the compaction experiment has an initial density of approximately 53%.\nStill, the overall densi\u001ccation behavior from DEM simulations shows a good agreement\nwith experimental data.\n\nFigure 8.2: a) Comparison between an experimental and numerical densi\u001ccation curve\n(axial stress vs. relative density) in a) a normal and b) logarithm scales.\nAfter compaction and unloading, the green numerical samples in our work were submitted to tensile, uniaxial/triaxial compression test DEM simulations. Uniaxial and triaxial\ncompression test simulations and experiments stress vs. strain curves of the standard\ncomposite (mix 1) were compared and have shown a good qualitative and quantitative\nagreement. A methodology to generate isodensity yield surfaces and fracture lines was\ndescribed by performing tensile and triaxial compression simulations (chapter 5). The\nadvantage of this method is the possibility of probing points in the deviatoric and mean\nstress space. This is very di\u001ecult or impossible to be measured by experiments (chapter\n3). These surfaces were \u001ctted with the elastoplastic Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC) model\n(chapter 7). In that sense, DEM simulations carried out on a periodic representative\nvolume element may be seen as numerical experiments that replace, or more realistically\ncomplement, laboratory experiments.\nThe virtual \u001cring stage in DEM was represented by ascribing bonds in all particles\nin contact from compacted numerical samples (chapter 6). The matrix was characterized\nby bonded \u001cne alumina particles. Pairs of bonded particles were broken (between \u001cne\nalumina and coarse alumina particles, and \u001cne alumina and graphite particles (chapter\n6) to represent the binder 'bell e\u001bect' e\u001bect related to the binder heating-cooling down\n(chapter 3). Triaxial experimental compression tests and simulations have shown a good\nqualitative and quantitative agreement. The tensile strength (maximum axial stress)\nfrom tensile simulations was underestimated compared with Brazilian experimental tests.\n217\n\nCHAPTER 8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nHowever, this di\u001berence comes from the fact that complex loading conditions of Brazilian\ntests are not well rendered by simple uniaxial tensile simulations. The stress state in this\ntest introduces both tensile and compressive components. The axial stresses from the\nDEM uniaxial tensile simulation are uniquely under tension. Still, observing the fracture\n(broken bonds propagation) of the numerical sample during the tensile simulation, it\nwas possible to highlight that the cracks propagated mostly within the regions with a\npre-existence of defects (fractured bonds to represent the binder 'bell e\u001bect').\nFinally, we have shown in chapter 7 the potential of DEM to generate constitutive\nequations to feed a compaction simulation using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The\naxial stress vs. relative density of closed-die numerical simulations (FEM and DEM) and\nexperiment exhibited a good quantitative and qualitative agreement. The DPC model\nmay be used on more complex shapes to model a VESUVIUS industrial compaction\nprocess.\n\n8.2 Future work\nSeveral interesting paths for future work can be considered to complement the results on\nthe compaction and mechanical properties of refractory composites, mainly using numerical simulations (DEM and FEM). Some guidance and suggestions are proposed in the\nfollowing.\n\n8.2.1 Applications using DEM\nCombining X-ray tomography images with DEM\nFirst, the DEM model developed in our work could be extended to combining X-ray\ntomography or SEM images with DEM to obtain more realistic structures. As seen in this\nPh.D. work, we did not consider the real shape of the actual raw materials (alumina grains\nand graphite pellets) and the porosity distribution. Still, we developed a simple way to\nrepresent in DEM these complex and heterogeneous microstructures, depending on their\ncomposition. The advantage of using more realistic microstructures would be to consider\nthe e\u001bect of grain size distribution, tablets orientation/aspect ratio, and other structural\nfeatures on the composite compaction behavior and mechanical properties considering\nthe real shape of the raw materials and porosity distribution. Fig. 8.3 shows an attempt\nof combining X-ray tomography images (mix 1 composite) with DEM packing. In this\nexample, the X-ray images were cut in cubes of 300x300x300 pixel-size and post-treated\nusing a segmentation method to separate the di\u001berent phases in gray tunes. In sequence,\nthese images were combined with dp3D to generate the DEM packing. It is a very rough\n218\n\n8.2. Future work\n\ndemonstration, but it exempli\u001ces the possibility of combining DEM with image analysis.\nThis approach has been used in previous Ph.D. works on nacre-like materials ([Radi,\n2020]) and silica aerogel composites ([Hamelin, 2021]) combining DEM with EBSD or\nX-ray tomography.\n\nFigure 8.3: a) X-ray tomography images (mix 1 standard composite). b) images posttreatment (segmentation method), and c) discrete element packing representing images\nfrom b).\nFracture behavior of virtually \u001cred refractory composites\nThe microscopic elastic material properties for particles and contacts for the virtually\nred samples were calibrated with experimental and numerical triaxial compression tests.\nThose elastic properties mainly included Young's modulus of the alumina, graphite, and\nbinder, and the bond strength (in tension and shear), as seen in chapter 6. A supplementary approach would be to model qualitatively and quantitatively the composite fracture\nproperties, including their sti\u001bness, strength, and toughness using appropriate contact\nmodels. Also, we saw in chapter 6 that the cracks propagate mainly due to the presence\nof defects. In other words, the cracks propagated in the regions where some bonds were\npreviously broken. An alternative would be to evaluate the crack propagation on more\nrealistic packings by considering the e\u001bect of particle size distribution and geometry. Fig.\n8.4 shows the discrete numerical samples representing SiC ceramics during mechanical\ntest simulations: (a) uniaxial compressive test, (b) Brazilian test, and (c) 3-point bending\ntests. The cracks are highlighted in red [Tan et al., 2009].\nParticle packing methodology\nVESUVIUS group is constantly studying alternatives to achieve a composite microstructure that o\u001bers good mechanical properties. A possible avenue for optimisation\nis by considering the particle packing (before the compaction). [Recarey et al., 2019],\n219\n\nCHAPTER 8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n\nFigure 8.4: Discrete element packings representing SiC ceramics. Simulations of a)\nuniaxial compressive test, b) Brazilian test, and c) 3-point bending test [Tan et al., 2009].\n\nfor example, presented a method for packing particles using the discrete element method\ncombining the Monte Carlo technique. Particles' dimensions can follow any given distribution and are generated with Monte Carlo techniques. The packing algorithm provides\nthat the growth direction can be outwards or inwards (Fig. 8.5), for example. The modeling of the packing of the particles could be extended to more realistic DEM composite\nmicrostructures by considering the irregular geometry of the raw materials and particles\ndistribution to help VESUVIUS in the design of new compositions. Level set methods\nare currently under development at SIMaP to replace simple spherical discrete elements\nby arbitrary shapes.\n\n8.2.2 Applications using FEM\nCompaction simulation of the industrial part\nAn additional path is to perform compaction simulations of industrial parts using\nthe data generated by DEM simulations. The objective would be to help VESUVIUS\nto identify the regions over-pressed (higher RD) and under-pressed (smaller RD) regions\nand predict the \u001cnal compacted shape from the initial one to improve the near-net-shape\nand future material development. For this purpose, a \u001crst attempt of simulating isostatic\ncompaction of an industrial part using the industrial process set up was performed. The\n220\n\n8.2. Future work\n\nFigure 8.5: a) Example of outwards packing. b) Example of inwards packing. Particles\ncomprising the advancing front are in dark grey [Recarey et al., 2019].\n\nsimulation is actually under development by a VESUVIUS colleague (Thy-Thuy-My), but\nsome preliminary results are presented. As a reminder, the yield and fracture surfaces\ngenerated by DEM simulations were \u001ctted with the DPC model, and its parameters were\ncalculated (chapter 7). The Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC) model parameters applied on\nFEA closed-die compaction in chapter 7 are also used for the reference composite (mix 1)\nin the isostatic compaction simulation. In this simulation, the powder is essentially \u001clled\ninside a rubber bag, sealed, and subjected to a 35MPa all-round pressure to produce the\ncompacted green ladle shroud component. The isostatic compaction model in ABAQUS is\nrepresented by an axisymmetric model composed of the mix, an elastomeric (rubber) bag,\nthe mandrel, and the closure. The mold is modeled using a \u001cnite deformation hyperelastic\nformulation ([Henderson et al., 2000]). The closure and mandrel are represented as a rigid\nbody. During the compaction, a uniform pressure of 35MPa is applied to the bag surface.\nFig. 8.6 shows the initial shape (before compaction) of the industrial part at a density\nof RD=60% followed by the \u001cnal shape with a density gradient. More work needs to\nbe performed, including a comparison of the dimensions of the numerical model and the\nactual industrial part after compaction and unloading. Also, an additional calibration\nof the DPC parameters might be necessary depending on the geometry and shape of the\nindustrial part. Still, this example shows a possible path for simulating complex industrial\npowder processes at VESUVIUS: numerical (DEM) and laboratory experiments feed FEM\nconstititive equations that are used to model real industrial parts up to the \u001cnal shape of\nthe component.\nThermo-mechanical simulation of the compacted industrial part\n221\n\nCHAPTER 8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n\nFigure 8.6: Isostatic compaction simulation of an industrial piece (ladle shroud) on\nABAQUS using the DPC parameters (mix 1). a) initial shape (RD=60%), before compaction. b) after compaction (average RD ≈ 90%) showing a density gradient.\n\nConcerning the FEM simulations approach, thermo-mechanical simulations could also be\nperformed on compacted industrial parts. The compaction induces a density gradient in\nthe \u001cnal part leading to thermo-mechanical property di\u001berences along the part. Consequently, when under operation, this density gradient may lead the piece to cracks and\ndamage. A \u001crst attempt of simulating the casting, considering the operation parameters\nset-up, was carried out. The casting considers the elastoplastic properties of the composite (from experimental data) with temperature dependence. The VESUVIUS modeling\n222\n\n8.2. Future work\n\nteam actually performs thermo-mechanical simulations on industrial parts coupled with\na experimental characterization and the Bigoni-Piccolroaz elasto plastic model. However,\nthese measurements may lead to an error. Also, in this case, the density gradient of the\nindustrial part is not taken into account. Fig. 8.7 shows a \u001crst attempt of modeling the\ncasting simulation of the compacted industrial part (mix 1) comparing cases 1 (homogeneous density) and case 2 (density gradient). The \u001cgure highlights the accumulative\nplastic strain distribution at the end of the thermo-mechanical simulation (Fig. 8.7 b).\nIn these preliminary results, it is possible to observe a di\u001berence in the distribution of\nthe accumulative plastic strain between both cases. This indicates that not only the part\ngeometry impacts on the \u001cnal material properties, but also the density distribution.\n\n223\n\nCHAPTER 8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n\nFigure 8.7: a) Final shape of the industrial part after isostatic compaction. b) casting (thermo-mechanical) simulation with temperature dependence. Case 1 represents a\nhomogeneous density (no density distribution). In case 2, the industrial part presents\na density gradient after compaction.

This module computes the e\u001bective thermal Panerai et al. [2017]\n[Pabst et al., 2018] and electrical conductivity of porous and composite materials. The\nmeasurement of the e\u001bective TC is carried out from X-ray tomography images and DEM\nnumerical samples. The results are compared with an experimental measurement carried\nout in VESUVIUS. The TC of the material phases are set as 12 W/mK (coarse alumina),\n7 W/mK (matrix), 200 W/mK (graphite), and porosity (0 W/mK) [Kallel, 2017]. The\nTC analysis in Geodict was performed applying the \u001cring temperature.\nFrom X-ray tomography images\nX-ray tomography images from Mix 1 after \u001cring are cut in volumes of 300x300x300 pixels\nand transferred to GeoDict. A total of 7 cubic samples were used.\nFrom DEM samples\nNumerical composites compacted up to di\u001berent relative densities (RD=0.7-1) using\ndp3D. The discrete element samples in 3D are converted into a \"raw\" format (voxelization\nalgorithm) and transferred to Geodict.\n\n245\n\nAPPENDIX A. EFFECTIVE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY\n\nFigure A.1: X-ray tomography images of Mix 1 (after \u001cring) are transformed into binary\nimages. The phases are separated into coarse alumina, graphite, matrix (\u001cne alumina and\nbinder), and porosity. Cubic samples (300x300x300 pixels) are transferred to GeoDict. A\ntotal of di\u001berent 7 cubic samples were used.\n\nFigure A.2: 3D DEM numerical packings compacted at di\u001berent relative densities\n(RD=0.7-1) are voxelized and transferred to GeoDict. The measured e\u001bective TC is\ncompared with the ones using X-ray tomography images.\n\n246\n\nAppendix B\nGraphite \u001dakes morphology before and\nafter DEM compaction simulations\nThe graphite's Young's modulus (E ) and some other properties, such as the thermal expansion, are highly orientation-dependent, with di\u001berent values between the parallel and\nperpendicular directions [Luchini et al., 2018], and highly a\u001bects the anisotropy of composite powder materials. In closed-die compaction, the signi\u001ccant di\u001berence between the\naxial and radial pressures must produce some anisotropy to the composite. According to\n[Klemm et al., 2013], more oriented graphite \u001dakes perpendicular to the pressing direction\nincreases the anisotropy of green samples compacted by closed-die con\u001cguration. A study\non the evolution of the graphite \u001dakes orientation after closed-die and isostatic compaction\nsimulations on discrete element samples and generated from X-ray tomography images\ncould be interesting.\n\n247\n\nAPPENDIX B. GRAPHITE FLAKES MORPHOLOGY BEFORE AND AFTER DEM\nCOMPACTION SIMULATIONS\n\nFigure B.1: Graphite \u001dakes morphology inside DEM composites after closed-die and\nisostatic compaction simulations.\n\n248\n\nAppendix C\nDrucker-Prager Cap model powder\nproperties\n\nFigure C.1: DPC model properties associated with the reference powder composite (Mix\n1) applied in ABAQUS for the closed-die compaction simulation.\n\n249\n\nAppendix D\nUser subroutine USDFLD\nThe DPC parameters are density-dependent. A USDFLD subroutine [Kallel, 2017] was\nused, on the closed-die compaction simulation, to calculate the relative density of each\nelement as a \u001celd variable.\n\n251\n\nAPPENDIX D. USER SUBROUTINE USDFLD\n\nFigure D.1: The user subroutine USDFLD was used in ABAQUS to link the DPC powder\ncomposite properties to a \u001celd variable (relative density).\n\n252\n\nAppendix E\nBigoni-Piccolroaz model (yield surfaces)\nTemperature-dependent simulations are carried out in VESUVIUS using the BigoniPiccolroaz (BP) elastoplastic model (chapter 2). The model contains approximately 30\ndi\u001berent parameters that are calculated with the help of an algorithm. For this, a long\nexperimental characterization on Mix 1 (after \u001cring) was performed in VESUVIUS by\ntechnicians to measure the composite thermo-mechanical properties and calculate the BP\nparameters. These experiments include mechanical tests (Crush, triaxial compression,\nand Brazilian) and thermal (TGA, dilatometry, thermal conductivity) analysis.\nComparison of DEM and experimental data with the BP yield and ultimate surfaces\n\nFigure E.1: DEM yield and ultimate points at di\u001berent densities (Fig. 6.7) vs. experimental data (Fig. 3.34). The DEM simulations and experiments were carried out on\ncompacted Mix 1 composite after \u001cring.\nDEM (isodensity yield and fracture surfaces) vs. BP (yield and ultimate surfaces)\n253\n\nAPPENDIX E.
