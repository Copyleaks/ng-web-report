Natural systems are dependent upon stress or strain\nrequirements where the material properties are optimally distributed. Using heterogeneous\ncomposite materials with a variable material distribution for distinct functional requirements,\nsimilar to natural structures, will enable to model, simulate and fabricate construction elements\nwith specific loading conditions. This work has developed a strategy to optimize material\ncomposition, through an algorithm editor combined with a FEM software. The code was created to\nlocally adjust a multi-material ratio according to the Von Mises stress map, simulating nature’s\nstructural behavior, to produce functional graded construction elements. A concept wall prototype\nwas tested as a case study, to explore the variation of material porosity. Further developments will\nenable to directly control the additive manufacturing equipment.\nINTRODUCTION\nArchitecture and Construction are highly interdisciplinary fields, involving numerous professional\nand engineering areas to produce structures with different levels of scale and complexity. The\nconstruction sector is increasingly challenged to optimize its performance and efficiency, reducing\ncosts and minimizing the environmental impact. Conversely, new technologies and rising client\nexpectations are pushing towards radical improvements in the construction sector.\n“Design by nature” has been optimized through years and years of natural evolution (Galha &\nBártolo, 2002). Biomimetics takes inspiration from nature designs and processes to solve human\nproblems (Jeronimidis & Atkins, 1995). Biological structures have been used to solve major\nchallenges in materials science, aerodynamics, mechanical engineering and architecture. Several\nnatural materials are complex composites with remarkable mechanical properties, such as wood,\nwith a strength per unit weight similar to the strongest steels, and mature bamboo, which stalks\nhave extraordinary slenderness ratios and a mechanical efficiency arising from the combination of\ncomposite and cellular microstructure. The natural function of these materials comes from its\nexceptional properties (Ashby et al., 1995). Natural systems’ geometry is dependent upon stress or\n\nProc. of the 2nd Intl.

This work aims to model,\nsimulate and fabricate sustainable construction elements, through additive manufacturing\ntechnologies, with optimal material characteristics able to respond to specific and distinct stress\nconditions, reducing the weight and material usage.\nADDITIVE MANUFACTURING IN CONSTRUCTION\nAdditive Manufacturing (AM) technologies refer to a class of manufacturing processes, in which a\npart is built by adding layers of material upon one another. There is a wide range of technologies\napplied in a variety of industries, including the aerospace, architectural, automotive and medical\nfields. Standardized AM technologies are mostly used to produce medium or small-scale objects,\nnot for large architectural systems.\nSeveral groups have been investigating the use of AM technologies for construction. Khoshnevis\n(2006) developed a concept for the automatic fabrication of a house called Contour Crafting,\nconsisting of the automatic fabrication of the building walls layer by layer, until the creation of a\nformwork filled, after the cure, by mortars mainly composed by cement. Recently, real scale\nprototypes were developed to print homes, namely by the Chinese company Yingchuang (Winsun,\n2014), and the World’s Advanced Saving Project (WASP, 2015). Lim (2009) developed a concrete\nprinting strategy based on the extrusion of cement mortars to produce 3D customized products,\nand Dini (2007) developed the D-Shape process. The Dutch company DUS Architects developed a\nFDM printer to 3D print a canal house in Amsterdam (DUS Architects, 2014).\nFUNCTIONALLY GRADED MATERIALS\nExisting additive manufacturing technologies are mostly used to design and fabricate physical\nelements with homogeneous material properties, not to produce materials with spatially varying\ncompositions, characterized by a gradual spatial change in composition and microstructure, which\nare defined by Miyamoto et al. (1999) as Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs). The spatial\nchange in its material properties vary from the composition to the microstructural gradient, and\npossibly can be customized to specific loading conditions. FGMs intends to replicate natural\nmaterials’ behavior, improving material and structural efficiency and reducing material usage, and\nminimize residual stresses caused by material heterogeneity.\nThe Mediated Matter group at MIT, led by Nery Oxman, developed new design and fabrication\nmethods to produce elements with varying density properties (Oxman, 2011). Craveiro et al.\n(2009, 2011a, 2011b) proposed a new fabrication system, called “RapidConstruction”, using\nvarious materials, mainly composed by cement, polymers and clay. This fabrication system\ncomprised a computer controlled mobile crane integrating multi-deposition heads with various\ndegrees of freedom. A functional prototype was developed with 3 extrusion heads, the first\nextrusion head used to process different composite materials like clay with natural fibers and\ncomposite concrete for contour paths, smoothing the material in the lateral surfaces. A second\nhead creates composite meshes and the third one extrudes filling material, both producing PU\npolymers with different compositions (FGM structure) (Craveiro et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2013a,\n2013b). Currently, an algorithmic code is being developed to control the material composition to\n\n189\n\nChee Kai Chua, Wai Yee Yeong, Ming Jen Tan, Erjia Liu and Shu Beng Tor (Eds.)\n\nsatisfy specific structural needs, and optimize the concept of varying material distribution in\nconstruction elements.\nOPTIMIZED FABRICATION STRATEGY\nThe system includes parametric models and structural analysis to provide an integrated generative\ntool allowing optimizing the material composition of the construction elements. A Finite Element\nMethod (FEM) software called Autodesk Simulation was used to structurally simulate these\nelements with varied functional constraints. The FEM allows to analyze complex structural forms.\nThe resulting data is analyzed through an algorithm, attributing distinct densities/material\ncomposition according to structural needs, considering that a higher Von Mises stress area requires\na stronger material, preventing structural failure by surpassing the yield strength of the material.\nA concept model of a building wall was designed as illustrated in Figure 1a. The 3D CAD model\nwas imported into the simulation software, where the distributed load is applied and the boundary\nconditions are set as fixed joints (Figure 1b), and the FEM mesh is generated (Figure 1c).\n\nFigure 1. Optimized Fabrication Strategy: a. CAD model, b. Distributed load and boundary\nconditions, c. FEM mesh generation, d. Von Mises stress results, e. AM process and f. Conceptual\nfabrication system.\nThe Von Mises stress results are illustrated in Figure 1d, where a gradation of color can be\nobserved from the lowest stress values (dark blue) to the highest ones (green). A conceptual\nrepresentation of the AM process and fabrication equipment are shown in Figure 1e and 1f. In this\ncase study, the building model wall has variable density corresponding to the number and size of\ninternal pores, adjusted according to stress concentration requirements, where the size of the pores\nis inversely proportional to the Von Mises stress values. The code was developed in a textual\nprogramming language (TPL) called Racket (front-end), using Rosetta environment and\nRhinoceros3D, as the output of the program (back-end) (Lopes & Leitão, 2011). The image map\ndata will then be imported to create pore size and density according to the stress diagram (Figure\n2a, c).\nArchitects and engineers have been increasingly interested in visual programming, using visual\ntools such as Grasshopper (Rhino plugin), allowing the description of programs in a bidimensional representation including iconic components, which can be interactively manipulated\nby the user (Myers, 1990). These components are boxes, representing shapes and operations, and\n\n190\n\nProc. of the 2nd Intl. Conf. on Progress in Additive Manufacturing\n\nconnectors linking the boxes, creating dataflows between components, where the output of a\ncomponent is the input of another (Lopes, 2012). A similar code was also developed through this\nvisual programming language (VPL), see Figure 2b. Using the image sampler script, it is possible\nto convert visual information into a series of numerical outputs. To parametrically convert these\nnumerical outputs into the size of the interior pores, the Von Mises stress diagram was inputted\ninto the image sampler.\na.\n\nc.\n\nb.\n\nFigure 2. Algorithmic code using TPL and VPL languages: a. Rosetta showing the Racket\nprogram, b. Grasshopper program, c. Output of programs in Rhinoceros3D.\nHowever, this method is limited to planar or low curved elements, so it was decided to discretize\nthe geometry of the prototype wall into very small cubic elements of volume called voxels (Figure\n3a). Porosity material compositions are separately assigned to each voxel, so each voxel assumes\none pore. Voxel based methods are based on discrete units and its accuracy is related to the\nnumber of voxels used in the model (Ma et al., 2001). This code allows defining the quantity of\nvoxels to achieve the desired accuracy. The Von Mises stress results are imported in .CSV format,\nincluding the coordinates of mesh nodes and its stress values, overlapping the voxels (Figure 3b).\nEach pore assumes the average of node values inside each voxel (Figure 3c).\na.\n\nb.\n\nc.\n\nFigure 3. Voxel creation example: a. voxel discretization, b. nodes overlapping voxels, c. one pore\ninside each voxel.\nThis concept wall was then produced by AM technologies, through a Connex3 (Polyjet), a 3D\nprinter using inkjet technology, adding successive layers of a liquid photopolymer cured through\nan UV lamp immediately after deposition. In this case study, two materials were used, one is\n\n191\n\nChee Kai Chua, Wai Yee Yeong, Ming Jen Tan, Erjia Liu and Shu Beng Tor (Eds.)\n\ntransparent (VeroClear-RGD810) and the other one is an opaque black material (VeroBlackPlus\nRGD875), designed for a better visualization of the porosity spatial distribution and size. Two\n.STL files were exported for building the prototype wall, the first one corresponding to the\ntransparent material and the second one to the black pore representation. The prototype is shown in\nFigure 4.\n\nFigure 4. Conceptual wall prototype designed for a better visualization of varying spatial porosity.\nCONCLUSIONS\nConversely to standardized CAD design in manufacturing, where the geometry is designed with a\nhomogeneous material distribution, a conceptual approach was developed to generate form in\ncombination with material property allocation, informed by desired properties and fabricated with\na multi-material printing method. To illustrate this approach, a concept wall prototype was tested\nas a case study, to explore the variation of material porosity. This approach consists of two parts:\nwe first propose a generative process combined with a voxel-based geometry and material design,\nthat is derived from the FEM data. Second, a prototype was produced through a Polyjet machine to\ncorroborate the approach.\nThe control over geometry and material composition can provide an opportunity to create a graded\nmaterial property distribution and increase the functionality of building walls which cannot be\nachieved using traditional CAD tools and conventional AM workflows. The main objective is to\ndirectly control the material composition on the voxel level to improve control on the printing\nstrategy which is very important to allow the digital design and fabrication of FGM construction\nelements. Future work involves further developments to advance the optimization process in order\nto enable a synchronized form generation and allocation of distinct material properties together\nwith the FEM software.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research work was supported by a grant (SFRH/BD/105404/2014) funded by the Portuguese\nScience Foundation.
