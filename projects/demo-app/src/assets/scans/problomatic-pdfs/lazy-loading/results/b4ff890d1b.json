Igor AndrÃ© Rodrigues Lopes\nDr. Shengua Wu\n\nOctober 13, 2016\n\nÂ© Miguel Carvalho, 2016\n\nAbstract\nComputational Framework for Multi-Scale Analysis of Heterogeneous Materials using Digital Image Recognition\nWith the advent of increasingly more complex heterogeneous materials, new methodologies are\nbeing developed to accurately predict their mechanical behaviour. At the microscale, a material\nis usually composed of multiple heterogeneities that, by interacting with the surroundings, may\nin\u001duence the macroscopic performance of the component.\nDuring this thesis, a\n\nDigital Image Based (DIB) microstructure recognition technique was\n\nemployed to model the microstructure of heterogeneous materials. This method enables the use\nof any given real 2D or 3D micrograph to identify di\u001berent constituents, create a\n\nRepresentative\n\nVolume Element (RVE) and generate a \u001cnite element mesh that correctly \u001cts these singularities.\nFollowing this, Multi-Scale models take advantage of RVEs generated with this approach to\nstudy the homogenized elastic properties of heterogeneous materials, such as the acquisition of\nthe full sti\u001bness tensor for orthotropic cases.\nIn addition, a study on the RVE and mesh size is performed for two- and three-phase\nmaterials. The in\u001duence of di\u001berent sti\u001bness ratios between \u001cber and matrix materials on the\nRVE size and on the homogenized properties is analysed and compared with analytical models,\nsuch as the\n\nHashin-Hill bounds and the Mori-Tanaka method. Moreover, the insertion of an\n\ninterface material in-between, changes the overall behaviour of a composite material, hence, a\nstudy of this factor is presented. Analytical expressions with extremely high accuracy against\nthe numerical results were deduced to estimate the homogenized plane Young's modulus under\nthese circumstances.\nFinally, this method does not consider simpli\u001ccations at the microscale, being able to model\nany constituent with arbitrary shapes or constitutive behaviours.\n\nTherefore the micrograph\n\nrecognition technique is an inspiring and breakthrough method that aims to develop and characterize new and more elaborated heterogeneous materials.\n\nKeywords: Micromechanics; Multi-Scale models; Homogenization; E\u001bective properties; Heterogeneous materials; OOFEM; DIB.\n\ni\n\nii\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nResumo\nModelo Computacional para AnÃ¡lise Multi-Escala de Materiais HeterogÃ©neos com\nbase em Reconhecimento Digital de Imagem\nDevido ao aparecimento de materiais cada vez mais complexos, novas metodologias estÃ£o\na ser desenvolvidas de forma a prever o comportamento mecÃ¢nico destes.\n\nÃ€ microescala, as\n\nmÃoltiplas heterogeneidades presentes num material interagem entre si e tendem a in\u001duenciar o\nseu comportamento macroscÃ3pico.\nAo longo desta tese foi utilizada uma tÃ©cnica de reconhecimento de imagem (\u0010Digital Image\nBased (DIB) microstructure recognition\u0011) para modelar a microestrutura do material.\npermite identi\u001ccar os seus constituintes, criar um\n\nEsta\n\nElemento Representativo de Volume (RVE)\n\ne gerar uma malha de elementos \u001cnitos, recorrendo a microgra\u001cas reais, com duas ou trÃas\ndimensÃμes. De seguida, e utilizando os RVEs gerados por este mÃ©todo, sÃ£o utilizados modelos\n\nMulti-Escala para estudar as propriedades elÃ¡sticas homogeneizadas de materiais heterogÃ©neos,\natravÃ©s do cÃ¡lculo do tensor de rigidez para casos ortotrÃ3picos.\nAlÃ©m disso, Ã© estudado o tamanho do RVE e da malha de elementos \u001cnitos em materiais\ncom duas e trÃas fases. A in\u001duÃancia do rÃ¡cio entre a rigidez da \u001cbra e da matriz no tamanho\ndo RVE e nas propriedades elÃ¡sticas homogeneizadas tambÃ©m Ã© analisada e comparada com os\nmÃ©todos analÃ­ticos, como Ã© o caso dos limites de\n\nHashin-Hill e do modelo de Mori-Tanaka. A\n\nintroduÃ§Ã£o de um novo material na interface entre a \u001cbra e a matriz altera o comportamento\ndo compÃ3sito e, como tal, este parÃ¢metro Ã© igualmente investigado. No caso apresentado, sÃ£o\ntambÃ©m deduzidas expressÃμes analÃ­ticas para estimar o mÃ3dulo de Young homogeneizado no\nplano que estÃ£o em concordÃ¢ncia com os resultados obtidos numericamente.\nPor Ãoltimo, o mÃ©todo aqui referido nÃ£o considera simpli\u001ccaÃ§Ãμes Ã  escala microscÃ3pica e\npermite modelar qualquer constituinte, independentemente da sua forma e do tipo de comportamento constitutivo que possui. Assim sendo, pode-se concluir que a modelaÃ§Ã£o de microestruturas atravÃ©s do reconhecimento de microgra\u001cas perfaz um mÃ©todo inspirador e revolucionÃ¡rio\nno desenvolvimento e caracterizaÃ§Ã£o de novos materiais heterogÃ©neos.\n\nPalavras-chave: Micro-mecÃ¢nica; Modelos Multi-Escala, HomogeneizaÃ§Ã£o, Propriedades efetivas; Materiais heterogÃ©neos; OOFEM; DIB.\n\niii\n\niv\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nAcknowledgements\nFirst of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Francisco Pires, for all the support\ngiven while structuring and documenting this thesis.

homogeneous materials have been used in a wide range of applications. Since the mid-19th century, new processes have been developed and steel started to\nbe mass-produced, being, since then, one of the most popular structural materials that exists,\neven nowadays.\n\nOther alloys, like aluminium, copper, nickel, titanium, are also widely used\n\non everyday engineering components due to their good mechanical properties. From the point\nof view of a mechanical engineer, these materials are well studied and documented in terms\nof their properties (elastic, thermal, electrical, and so on). For example, steel, as an isotropic\nmaterial, exhibits the same properties regardless the direction it has been loaded.\n\nHowever,\n\nwhen considering heterogeneous materials, these assumptions are not valid and a deeper analysis is needed to fully understand their properties and to be able to correctly choose a material\nregarding the \u001cnal application.\nOver the last years, a signi\u001ccant focus is being placed on the development of new heterogeneous materials. The high speci\u001cc sti\u001bness (sti\u001bness to weight ratio) is one of their major\nattributes, making high-end \u001celds like aeronautics and naval industries interested in such materials. Ceramic-metal composites also have great potential in various technological \u001celds, due to\ntheir increased thermal, mechanical and electrical properties. In the framework of this thesis,\nthe elastic properties of heterogeneous materials are analysed, taking into account that their\nbehaviour is highly dependent on the material microstructure.\nSeveral experimental procedures can be performed to \u001cnd the elastic properties of a given\nmaterial, but these analyses are very expensive and time-consuming. Since the late 19-century\nwith\n\nWoldemar Voigt, analytical methods are being developed to estimate the overall elastic\n\nproperties of composite materials, taking into account the elastic properties of the constituents.\nThe\n\nVoigt model (Voigt, 1889), also known as the rule of mixtures is a simple linear method\n\nbut, more recently, other authors have been creating more complex and meaningful models,\nas the\n\nMori-Tanaka method (Mori and Tanaka, 1973) that also aims to predict the e\u001bective\n\nproperties of heterogeneous materials.\n1\n\n2\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nFollowing the high evolution of computational power, numerical methods, like the\n\nFinite\n\nElement Method, are being widely used to solve the mathematical equations that govern the\n\nbehaviour of the materials when a load or deformation is applied. However, conventional macroscopic constitutive models do not take into consideration complex phenomena that occur at the\nmicrostructure level and may in\u001duence the global behaviour. A new approach that considers\nboth macro and microscales is being developed:\n\nMulti-Scale models. Instead of using constitu-\n\ntive models to characterize the behaviour of a solid, this method is based on the analysis of a\n\nRepresentative Volume Element (RVE), which is a model of the microstruscture of the material.\nThe RVE contains information about the constituents properties and geometry. Homogenization\ntechniques are employed to obtain macroscopic properties from microscopic scales.\nMore recently,\n\nDigital Image Based (DIB) microstructure recognition is under development,\n\naiming to generate a model of the microstructure according to a real micrograph of the considered material. With this technique, it is possible to create a \u001cnite element mesh for the RVE\nbased on an micrograph of the material at the microscale.\n\nAfter the solution of the micro-\n\nequilibrium equations of the RVE, the homogenized stress and strain are computed and an\nestimation of the e\u001bective elastic properties of the material can be obtained. This estimation\nis more accurate than those made by the analytical methods, since it takes into account the\ngeometry of the microstructure and not only the properties of the phases.\n\n1.1 Goals\nThe main goal of this thesis is to investigate and explore recent developments in image acquisition and non linear \u001cnite element models to estimate the e\u001bective elastic properties of\nheterogeneous materials based on a DIB microstructure recognition technique.\nIn order to accomplish this, a basic knowledge of\n\nContinuum Mechanics, Micromechanics\n\nMulti-Scale models is required to better understand the concepts behind the program used\nto solve the equilibrium equations, Micro-Scale Problem (MSP).\nand\n\nÂ®\n\nThe DIB microstructure recognition is developed with the Linux\n\nopen-source program\n\nOOF2 (\"Object Oriented Finite-Elements\", version 2), hence, understanding this program is\nessential and is deemed as the \u001crst step to accomplish the goal of this thesis.\n\nÂ®\n\nA Matlab\n\nscript has to be made to convert the output information of OOF2 to the required information\n\nÂ®\n\nof MSP, and later, another Matlab\n\nscript needs to be created to compute the e\u001bective elastic\n\nproperties from the output information of the MSP. The program OOF3D (\"Object Oriented\nFinite-Elements\", 3D version), that creates \u001cnite element meshes from 3D RVEs like CT scans,\nis also going to be explored.\nTo correctly estimate these properties, several studies have to be made\n\na-priori. A study\n\nabout the RVE size needs to be done to \u001cnd the smallest size that still correctly represents the\nmicrostructure. The in\u001duence of di\u001berent parameters in the RVE size is going to be analysed\n(e.g. the ratio between the \u001cber and matrix sti\u001bness). The dependency of the overall elastic\n\nChapter 4\nDigital Image Based Microstructure\nRecognition\n\nThe main objective of this work is to estimate the e\u001bective elastic properties of any material\nfrom its the microscopic structure.\n\nRegarding only the phases' volume fractions and elas-\n\ntic properties, analytical methods, such as mean-\u001celd approaches and other spatial averaging\ntechniques, can be used to determine these overall properties (further reviewed in Chapter 5).\nHowever, these methods usually do not take into account the geometry of the microstructure\nand so, in applications where its in\u001duence becomes critical, methods based on RVE analysis,\nwhere microscopic heterogeneities can be modelled, are better suited for a proper de\u001cnition of\nthe micro-macro relation.\nThere are several numerical procedures to generate RVEs based on microstructure informations (e.g. for a unidirectional \u001cber composite, a\n\nMonte Carlo randomness approach can be\n\nused to create a large number of RVEs, if the size of the RVE and \u001cber volume fraction are\nprovided) but, if the material presents a microstructure that has heterogeneities with random\nand complex shapes, these methods are not su\u001eciently accurate.\nTherefore, in order to overcome these di\u001eculties,\n\nDigital Image Based (DIB) microstructure\n\nrecognition techniques are used, enabling the construction of a \u001cnite element model based on a\nmicrograph from a representative slice of the material. Therefore, the data obtained from this\ntype of analysis can be related with the material that is going to be used in a project. Using this\nmethod, any type of complex shape can be modelled (even voids), but it is important to note\nthat this method involves approximations from the beginning, since the \u001cnite element mesh is\nan approximation of an image that in turn is also a pixel discretization of the real structure.\nIn this chapter, the detailed procedure to obtain the 2D \u001cnite element mesh from an image\n\nÂ®\n\nusing the Linux\n\n1 (named for \"Object Oriented Finite-\n\nopen-source software package OOF2\n\nElements\", version 2) (Technology, 2016) is explained.\n\n1\n\nThe version of the program used is OOF2 2.1.12.\n37\n\n38\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nIn Waters et al. (2015), OOF is used to model porous copper and, studies of Ni-Al2 O3\ncomposites based on DIB microstructure recognition can be found in Sharma et al. (2012) and\nSharma et al. (2014).\nFinally, the DIB microstructure recognition is applied to 3D RVEs using the open-source\n\n2 (named for \"Object Oriented Finite-Elements\", version 3D).\n\nsoftware package OOF3D\n\n4.1 Acquisition of a Micrograph\nFirst of all, before having the image of the microstructure, one has to capture it. In spite of\nbeing beyond the scope of this work, a brief introduction on how to obtain a micrograph is\ngiven in this section.\nBesides the usual optical devices such as light microscopes, one of the most used methods to\nobtain a micrograph is the\n\nscanning electron microscopy (SEM). It uses a beam of electrons to\n\nscan over a surface, enabling the user to get information about the sample's surface topography\nand composition. Depending on the instrument, the resolution range is from about 1 nm, up\nto 20 nm.\n\nDuring the process, the only variable that can change is the amount of electrons\n\nreceived by the detector in a x, y position, and so, only a single value can be attributed to each\npixel of the captured image. This leads to a single gradient from black to white, and a gray scale\nimage is created. Nonetheless, there are several ways to produce a color in a SEM image, such\nas replacing the gray level of each pixel with an arbitrary color, or by photo-editing the image\nwith a speci\u001cc software.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) can also be used to generate\n\nimages with resolution of the nanometre order. The main idea is that the beam of electrons is\ntransmitted through an ultra-thin specimen of the material under analysis. An image is then\nformed from the interaction of this electrons with the specimen as they pass thorough it.\nThere are also methods that can be used to create a 3D model of the interior of a material\nwithout destroying the actual object.\n\nX-ray microtomography, uses X-rays to generate several\n\nimages of the cross-section of the material and can perform with resolutions at the micrometre\norder (Âμm). Micro-CT (micro-computed tomography) scanners (Figure 4.1a) are used to capture\nthese cross-section images.\n\n4.2 Image-Based Finite Element Mesh\nAt this moment, with the micrograph of the material at hand, a \u001cnite element mesh that\nmodels its microstructure can be created, but several actions have to be completed before the\nnal output is achieved. In this section, the overall procedure is described in detail and, at the\nend, an example is presented to ensure a better comprehension of the reader. This section was\nbased on A.Langer et al. (2001) and Reid et al. (2008).\nIt is important to note that OOF2 permits the use of di\u001berent images to represent a single\nmicrostructure - the main structure of the program. For instance, there may be cases where\n\n2\n\nThe version of the program used is OOF3D 3.0.1.\n\nChapter 4.\n\nDigital Image Based Microstructure Recognition\n\n(a) Micro-CT scanner (Bergen, 2016).\n\n39\n\n(b) SEM scanner (Hitachi, 2016).\n\nFigure 4.1: Examples of SEM and a micro-CT scanners.\n\none image can represent well enough the majority of a microstructure but some singularities\nare represented with higher de\u001cnition in another image and, in this case, the user just has to\nbe sure that both images have the same pixel size (width and height) to be able to use them\nsimultaneously. While creating the microstructure, OOF2 automatically interprets the size of\nthe image as pixel dimensions, however, the user is advised to de\u001cne the microstructure's size\n\n3\n\nwith physical dimensions , to facilitate the process of creating the \u001cnite element mesh.\nTo brie\u001dy introduce the whole process, in the \u001crst place a microstructure is created from an\nimage \u001cle to further identify the di\u001berent pixel groups that belong to speci\u001cc materials, based\non its di\u001berent color values. Secondly, the material properties of interest to the de\u001cnition of\nthe problem (elastic, thermal, electric and so on) are attributed to these pixel groups. In the\nthird place, a skeleton that contains the geometry of the \u001cnite element mesh is created and\nimproved in order to minimize two elemental functionals, named\n\nshape energy and homogeneity\n\nenergy, that quantify the skeleton quality, and as a result, the mesh quality. Finally, with\nthe last version of the skeleton (that only contains the mesh geometry), the \u001cnite element\nmesh is created while attributing, respectively, triangular and quadrilateral elements (linear or\nquadratic order) to the triangles and quadrilaterals of the skeleton.\nSummarizing, the user has to follow the steps presented below:\n1. Create a microstructure based on an image (or several);\n2. Segment the microstructure into di\u001berent pixel groups;\n3. Assign materials to these groups that represent the microstructure's constituents;\n4. Generate a skeleton that correctly represents this microstructure;\n5. Create the \u001cnite element mesh based on the \u001cnal version of the skeleton;\n\n3\n\nOOF2 has no built in system of units. The output data will be in the units that are given by the user. The\n(SI) is recommended.\n\nInternational System of Units\n\n40\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\n4.2.1 Image Treatment\nBefore the segmentation process of the micrograph can begin, there are cases where the boundaries of di\u001berent materials are not well de\u001cned due to low image quality, and so, some image\nprocessing may be needed to better distinguish these singularities. Nonetheless, it is relevant\nto \u001crst de\u001cne two concepts that are frequently used when addressing images in 2D and 3D:\n\nPixel -\n\nIt stands for \"picture element\" and it is the smallest physical and controllable\n\nelement of a picture that can be represented on a screen device.\nAn important note is made on the concept of image resolution as it stands for the capacity to\nobserve or measure the smallest object clearly and with distinct boundaries, and it is basically\nthe pixel count in a digital image.\n\nThere are several ways to quantify the resolution of an\n\nimage, being the number of pixels columns (width) and rows (height) one of the most common\nmethods.\n\nOne can simply multiply the number o pixel columns by pixel rows to obtain the\n\namount of pixels contained in an image, usually given in megapixel [MP]. Finally, the concept\nof PPI (Pixel Per Inch) is also usually used as a quanti\u001cer of the image resolution.\n\nVoxel -\n\nThis word is based on the words \"volume\" and \"element\" and, similarly to the\n\npixel, it represents a value on a regular grid that exists in the three dimensional space. With it,\nit is possible to represent an object in 3D and some volumetric displays describe their resolution\nin voxel dimensions (e.g. 1024 Ã— 1024 Ã— 1024 voxels). The segmentation of a 3D RVE and the\ngeneration of a \u001cnite element mesh is, in all, similar to the procedure here explained for the 2D\ncase, however, one must substitute the concept of pixel with voxel.\n\nWith this in mind, OOF2 contains almost 20 image modi\u001ccation algorithms that enable the\nuser to improve the quality of the material boundaries and solve other problems that may exist.\nAlong the usual ones, such as negating, fading, dimming, enhancing the contrast or converting the image to gray scale, OOF2 can also utilize functions of higher complexity. Some\n\nGaussian function4 , like Blur and Sharpen. Despeckle and ReduceNoise aim to reduce\nthe noise of the image while preserving the material edges and MedianFilter reduces the noise\nutilize a\n\nby replacing each pixel color with the median over a local region with a user-de\u001cned pixel radius. The\n\nNormalize routine, normalizes the gray scale image to cover the full range of values,\n\nmeaning that the color of lightest pixel is converted into white (i.e 0 in the gray scale range),\nthe color of the darkest one is converted into black (i.e 255 in the gray scale range) and the rest\nof the pixels su\u001ber the same scale transition.\nAn example is demonstrated in Figure 4.2. It can be noticed that the initial micrograph does\nnot correctly represent the materials' boundaries. Firstly, the image is\nIn the second place, the\nnoise,\n\n4\n\nNormalized (Figure 4.2b).\n\nContrast tool is applied 5 times (Figure 4.2c). Then, to reduce the\n\nMedianFilter is used with a radius of 5 pixels for 10 consecutively iterations (Figure 4.2d).\n\nFunction utilized in statistics to describe the normal distributions.\n\nChapter 4.\n\nDigital Image Based Microstructure Recognition\n\n41\n\nIn Section 4.2.2, a comparison between a segmentation of the initial and \u001cnal image is made in\norder to illustrate the importance of processing the original image (Figure 4.4).\n\n(a) Initial micrograph.\n\n(b) Applying the Normalize tool.\n\n(c) Applying the Contrast tool \u001cve times.\n\n(d) Applying the MedianFilter tool ten times.\n\nFigure 4.2: Demonstration of an image treatment of a micrograph of a lamellar directionally\nsolidi\u001ced eutectic of NiO (lighter phase) and yttria-stabilized ZrO2 (darker phase) (A.Langer\net al., 2001).\n\n4.2.2 Image Segmentation\nAfter the image treatment process, the boundaries between the di\u001berent materials are expected\nto be more distinct and, therefore, the segmentation process can start. The main objective of\nthis process is to select all the pixels that belong to a microstructure's feature and group them\ntogether so that the material properties can be attributed to these pixels simultaneously. These\ngroups can be named and stored for later retrieval.\nIn addition to the usual selection methods, like user-manual selection tools (e.g. selecting\nindividual pixels or pixels that are inside a rectangle or a circle), automatic tools are also\navailable. There are two major tools to select pixels based on their colors:\n\n42\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nColor/Demography Tool -\n\nWith this tool, it is possible to select all the pixels that are\n\nwithin a color range of a previously targeted one, since it ignores this pixel's location.\n\nThe\n\ncolor range value can be de\u001cned by a gray, RGB (Red, Blue and Green) or HSV code (Hue,\nSaturation and Value).\n\nAll range values are de\u001cned by a decimal number between 0 and 1,\n\nexcept Hue that can be de\u001cned by any value between 0 and 360.\n\nBurn Tool -\n\nSimilar to the\n\nColor/Demography method, the Burn tool enables the selec-\n\ntion of multiple pixels that are within a color range of the targeted one. However, the main\ndi\u001berence is that it only selects contiguous pixels to the targeted one and not all of them. The\nselection spreads from the selected pixel and a\n\nlocal and global \u001dammability value must be\n\nde\u001cned to determine if the selection continues from one pixel to another.\n\nlocal \u001dammability is the maximum di\u001berence between two neighbouring pixel values,\nwhile the global \u001dammability is the di\u001berence between the initial pixel value beyond which the\nThe\n\nselection will not occur. The di\u001berence can be computed either through the sum of the absolute\nvalues of the RGB di\u001berences (\n\nL2 ).\n\nL1 ) or through the square root of the sum of the squares of the\n\nRGB di\u001berences (\n\nColor and Burn methods is presented. Taking into\nconsideration the Color tool, the range di\u001berence is computed in gray scale values, with delta\ngray 5 = 0.3, while the target is any purely white pixel. Regarding the Burn tool, the local and\nglobal \u001dammability are set to 0.15 and a light pixel from the middle grain is selected.\nIn Figure 4.3 the di\u001berence between the\n\n(a) Color tool.\n\n(b) Burn tool.\n\nFigure 4.3: Comparission between the\n\nColor and Burn methods using the image in Figure 4.2d.\n\nIt is also noteworthy to demonstrate the di\u001berence between a segmentation on a low quality\nimage (Figure 4.2a) and on an image that has already been treated (Figure 4.2d). The method\nchosen to select the pixels is the\nthe example of Figure 4.3a.\nselected by the\n\n5\n\nDelta gray\n\nColor one and the parameters are equal to the ones used on\n\nThe amount of pixels of this image is 695300 and the amount\n\nColor method on the \u001crst case is 523688, while on the second case is 301073.\n\nis the parameter that de\u001cnes the gray color range value in OOF2.\n\nChapter 4.\n\nDigital Image Based Microstructure Recognition\n\n43\n\nThe di\u001berence in the volume fraction of the light material from one case to another is around\n\n30%, which is high. The selection results are demonstrated in Figure 4.4.\n\n(a) Selection without any image treatment (b) Selection after the image treatment (Fig(Figure 4.2a).\nure 4.2d).\nFigure 4.4: Comparison between the\n\nColor method on low and high qualty images.\n\nIn cases where the selection of a speci\u001cc feature is di\u001ecult, it is easier to select the\n\nNote:\n\nopposite of it and then invert the selection.\n\nAttribution of Material Properties\nRegarding the attribution of a material to the di\u001berent pixel groups, OOF2 has a large list of options. It is possible to assign elastic, thermal and electrical properties, and, within the elasticity\noptions, there is the possibility to assign any 3D crystal symmetry and any 3D crystallographic\norientation to a material (e.g. isotropic, orthotropic and anisotropic materials), since one can\ninsert the full 3D sti\u001bness tensor, but, in the framework of this project, only isotropic elasticity\nis relevant. Furthermore, since an isotropic material can be characterized by two elastic con-\n\n6\n\nstants , the\n\nYoung's modulus and the Poisson's ratio, or the LamÃ© parameters7 are enough to\n\ncorrectly de\u001cne it. At this moment, the values of these properties are not relevant, since they\ncan be changed later on, during the migration of the \u001cnal mesh output \u001cle to the MSP program.\n\nNote: In OOF2, the material information can be saved on a data \u001cle with the extension \".material\" for later retrieval.\n\nActive Areas\nIt is also important to notice that there are cases where parts of the geometry are not supposed\nto be meshed, like in the study of microstructures with voids. Before the creation of the skeleton\nbegins, the user can select these areas and inactivate them - these areas do not have any material\nattributed and can be selected via the same pixel selection methods.\n\n6\n7\n\nLater addressed in Chapter 5.\nAppendix A presents the relations between the most common elastic constants.\n\n44\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\n4.2.3 Skeleton and Mesh Quality\nBefore explaining the automated procedure to create a \u001cnite element mesh based on the already\nsegmented image, it is important to have a quantitative measure of the quality of the mesh (or\nskeleton).\n\nThis value a\u001bects the convergence behaviour of the results in the \u001cnite element\n\nNewton-Raphson method) and also dictates if the \u001cnite element\n\nsolver (in this case, in the\n\nmesh correctly represents the microstructure or not. In OOF2, this quality is measured by an\nelemental potential energy, E , and most of the skeleton modi\u001ccation routines are designed to\nlower it.\nThe elemental potential energy is a weighted average of two elemental functionals (Reid\net al., 2008):\n\nShape Energy -\n\nThis energy function quanti\u001ces the shape of the \u001cnite element taking into\n\naccount its aspect-ratio. Since high aspect-ratio elements are responsible for a slow convergence\nof the \u001cnite element solver, in this type of elements the\n\nshape energy, Eshape , has a high value.\n\nThe minimization scheme of the potential energy promotes low aspect-ratio elements and so,\nsquares and equilateral triangles have a null\n\nshape energy (Figure 4.5a, 4.5c).\n\nFor triangular elements it is denoted by:\n\nâˆš\n4 3A\nEshape = 1 âˆ’ 2\n,\nL0 + L21 + L22\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere A is the area of the element and Li are the length of the element sides. In the case of\nquadrilateral (quad) elements, this energy is measured in each corner by the following equation:\n\nq=\n\n2Ak\n,\n2\nL0 + L21\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere Li are the length of the adjacent edges to the respective corner and Ak is the area of\nthe parallelogram formed by these edges. So that this elemental functional is dependent on the\nposition of all nodes, the\n\nshape energy of a quad is de\u001cned as a weighted average of the corner\n\nwith the minimum energy, qmin , and the opposite corner, qop , and it is given by:\n\nEshape = 1 âˆ’ ((1 âˆ’ wop ) qmin + wop qop ) ,\nin which wop is a parameter\n\n(4.3)\n\n8 assuming the value of 10âˆ’5 .\n\nHomogeneity Energy -\n\nOn the other hand, this function is responsible to measure\n\nthe degree of similarity between the skeleton (and later, the \u001cnite element mesh) and the\nmicrostructure's image. It is de\u001cned by a simple equation:\n\nH=\n8\n\nmax{ai }\n\nA\n\n,\n\n(4.4)\n\nThe value of wop needs to be small enough so that Eshape is dominated by qmin but not too small to keep\nthe importance of qop in the equation.\n\nChapter 4.\n\nDigital Image Based Microstructure Recognition\n\n45\n\n(a) Quadrilateral element with Eshape = 0.\n\n(b) Quadrilateral element with Eshape > 0.\n\n(c) Triangular element with Eshape = 0.\n\n(d) Triangular element with Eshape > 0.\n\nFigure 4.5: Perfect and badly shaped quadrilateral and triangular elements.\n\nwhere ai is the area of each material within the element (this expression takes into consideration\nthe fractional area of the pixels that intersect the boundaries of the element, thus making this\nfunctional a continuous function) and A is the area of the element.\n\nIf an element is \u001clled with only one material, its homogeneity is 1.0 (Figure 4.6a), but,\ndue to the fact that the\n\nhomogeneity energy, Ehom , should be de\u001cned as null for the perfect\n\nhomogeneous element, this functional is expressed by:\n\nEhom = 1 âˆ’ H.\n\n(4.5)\n\nAs addressed earlier, the e\u001bective elemental energy, E , is a combination of both elemental\nfunctionals weighted by a tunable parameter, Î±, that de\u001cnes if the priority is to lower the\n\nenergy or the homogeneity energy,\nE = Î±Ehom + (1 âˆ’ Î±)Eshape .\n\nshape\n\n(4.6)\n\nThis parameter has to be set for all the skeleton adaptive routines but, it is also possible to de\u001cne\nother restrictions while using these methods. The priority is de\u001cned by choosing the parameter\n\nÎ±, but additional restrictions may be set to the shape and homogeneity energy values, which is\nan important feature in several adaptive steps.\n\n46\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\n(a) Quadrilateral element with H = 1.0.\n\n(b) Quadrilateral element with H = 0.5.\n\n(c) Quadrilateral element with H = 0.5.\n\n(d) Quadrilateral element with H = 0.25.\n\nFigure 4.6: Scheme to represent the homogeneity on di\u001berent cases.\n\n4.2.4 Adaptive Methods to Generate and Re\u001cne a Mesh\nFinally, considering the mesh quality parameters, the whole procedure to generate, re\u001cne and\nimprove the \u001cnite element mesh build on a micrograph is described in this section.\nBefore reviewing the di\u001berent mesh adaptive routines that are available in OOF2, it should\nbe noted that this program enables the user to select the elements and nodes that are important\nto analyse, allowing for a shorter computational time.\n\nSelection of Relevant Elements and Nodes\nOne can select elements either based on their type (triangular or quad), on their material, on\ntheir\n\nhomogeneity and shape energy or on other characteristics. In addition, it is even possible\n\nto expand the element selection to better address a speci\u001cc area. As far as the node selection is\nconcerned, there are a couple of similar functions and one can also select the ones that belong\nto the already selected elements.\nFurthermore, the user is also able to pin the internal boundary nodes that de\u001cne the material\nboundaries to better adapt the mesh around a boundary without having these nodes moved\nfrom their coordinates.\n\nChapter 4.\n\nDigital Image Based Microstructure Recognition\n\n47\n\nGeneration of the Finite Element Mesh Geometry\nRegarding the microstructure's geometry, most of the usual mesh generator programs use mathematical functions to de\u001cne the material boundaries and then create a mesh that \u001cts to these\nboundaries. However, it is important to notice that during the image recognition of a micrograph, the problem's geometry is not so well de\u001cned and the boundaries can be somehow jagged\ndue to the image pixelation.\nThere are three main approaches to create a \u001cnite element mesh based on an image, the\nsimplest being the allocation of a quadrilateral or two triangular elements to each pixel (by\nclicking on the \"Simple...\" button in the\n\nSkeleton window of OOF2). This process raises two\n\nproblems: \u001crst of all, it generates a number of elements far higher than the amount needed\n(large homogeneous regions can be discretized with a coarser mesh without loss of accuracy in\nthe results), and secondly, it places the material boundaries of the mesh on the jagged pixelized\nrepresentation of the boundaries presented in the image, leading to high stress concentration\nfactors and to poor \u001cnite element convergence properties.\nOne can also simply create a grid of triangular or quadrilateral elements by de\u001cning the\namount of elements in each dimension of the RVE, and later re\u001cne and improve it using the\nadaptive functions of OOF2 that take into account the mesh quality parameters addressed in\nSection 4.2.3.\nFinally, after segmenting the image, OOF2 has an automated script (by selecting the\n\"Auto...\" button in the\n\nSkeleton window) to generate a \u001crst stage skeleton that attempts to\n\nmodel the micrograph. It incorporates a sequence of routines that re\u001cne and shape the skeleton\nto the material boundaries, requiring the user to de\u001cne three parameters:\n\nÂˆ Maxscale - an estimated size for the biggest elements in the initial skeleton;\nÂˆ Minscale - an estimated size for the smallest elements in the \u001cnal skeleton;\nÂˆ Homogeneity threshold - this dictates which elements will be re\u001cned and which not.\n\nhomogeneity below the speci\u001ced threshold are subdivided\nuntil their homogeneity is above the threshold or their size becomes smaller than the minscale\nDuring the process, all elements with\n\nparameter.\nBefore explaining this automated procedure, the skeleton adaptive routines must be elucidated and, to do so, it is important to \u001crst classify and divide them into two major aspects:\n\nÂˆ Topology preserving routines - these methods move nodes while preserving the connectivity of the starting skeleton, improving it without increasing the number of elements;\n\nÂˆ Topology non-preserving routines - these methods use algorithms that improve the skeleton by adding, removing or reconnecting nodes and elements.\nAll routines are presented and classi\u001ced based on other characteristics in Table 4.1 and the\nmost important ones are further discussed in this section.\n\n48\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nTable 4.1: Classi\u001ccation of the OOF2 skeleton adaptive routines (Reid et al., 2008).\n\nRoutine\nAnneal\nFix Illegal Elements\nMerge Triangles\nRationalize\nRe\u001cne\nRelax\nSmooth\nSnap Anneal\nSnap Nodes\nSnap Re\u001cne\nSplit Quads\nSwap Edges\nManual Node Motion\n\nPreserving Homogeneity Shape\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nMC\n\nSnap Fix\n\nPOT\n\nX\n\nO\nO\n\nX\n\nO\n\nOT\nOT\nO\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nO\nO\n\nX\n\nX\n\nIn this table header, Preserving indicates if the algorithm falls into a topology preserving routine, Homogenity\nand Shape specify if the primarily concern of the routine is to lower the homogeneity or shape energy, respectively. Snap shows that the new node position must lie on top of a material boundary and Fix means that the\nalgorithm \u001cxes badly shaped or illegal elements. MC stands for Monte Carlo methods and the letter P means\nthat the new node positions are chosen randomly, O implies that the routine addresses nodes in a random order and T indicates that it accepts/rejects\nmoves randomly based on a probability p given by a Boltzmanm\n\u0001\ndistribution in which p = exp âˆ’âˆ†E\n, where âˆ†E is the change in energy.\nT\n\nAnneal -\n\nDuring the\n\nAnneal algorithm, the targeted nodes are moved to random positions\n\nwithin a speci\u001ced radius, Î ́ , and these new positions\n\n9 are accepted or rejected according to a\n\nuser-de\u001cned criterion: either accepting all moves or only the ones that decrease the e\u001bective\nenergy of the system or only those that decrease this energy and simultaneously satisfy a\n\nhomogeneity and shape condition.\nThis process usually requires several iterations to be successful since for each iteration, one\nnode only attempts one move.\n\nThe user can de\u001cne a \u001cxed number of iterations or set the\n\nprocess to stop after a certain condition is guaranteed (e.g the success rate of the process being\nlower than speci\u001ced value). As mentioned in Table 4.1, the order in which the nodes are moved\nis random and changes in each iteration.\nBefore moving one node to a new position, OOF2 computes the total e\u001bective energy of the\nelements where it belongs and, afterwards, the chosen criterion de\u001cnes if the move is either accepted or rejected (the moves that create illegal elements are automatically rejected). Table 4.1\nalso states that it is possible to accept a movement which initially was rejected, according to a\nprobability given by a\n\n9\n\nBoltzmanm distribution.\n\nComputed from a Gaussian distribution of width Î ́ and mean 0.0\n\nChapter 4.\n\nDigital Image Based Microstructure Recognition\n\n49\n\nWhen the elements size is already good enough to resolve all the singularities of the micro-\n\nAnneal routine is useful and can usually take into account both homogeneity and\nshape energy, depending on the parameter Î±.\n\ngraph, the\n\nSmooth -\n\nThis algorithm is similar to the\n\nAnneal method but instead of moving a target\n\nnode in a random way, it attempts to move it to the average position of the adjacent nodes (i.e\nnodes that share a common segment), without ever creating illegal elements.\nThe name is self-explanatory since this method aims to improve the elements shape by\nsmoothing the node density gradients. It is usually employed on the last steps to create the\nnal skeleton and, combined with the aforementioned\n\nPin Nodes function, increases the quality\n\nof the elements around material boundaries without changing their homogeneity, improving the\nconvergence behaviour of the \u001cnite element solver.\n\nSnap Nodes -\n\nThis routine main objective is to improve the\n\nhomogeneity energy of an\n\nelement by snapping its nodes to the material boundaries.\nIt scans the current skeleton selection to check if there are elements below a speci\u001ced homogeneity and identi\u001ces the transition point for each segment of these elements. Afterwards,\nbased on the arrangement of its transition points, assigns a priority to each situation (Reid\net al., 2008) and, starting from the highest priority, attempts to move the nodes to these points.\nIt can move one or two nodes from the same element simultaneously and, when the move is\naccepted according to a given criterion, OOF2 tries to snap the nodes from the surrounding\nelements to better adjust to a boundary.\nDue to the nature of this process,\n\nSnap Nodes contributes to the creation of badly shaped\n\nelements when Î± is large, however, it is more e\u001ecient if this parameter favours homogeneity.\nLater, the user can use the\n\nRe\u001cne -\n\nRationalize routine to eliminate these elements.\n\nThis is usually the \u001crst step to create a skeleton. The element's size needs to\n\nbe small enough to correctly resolve the singularities of the microstructure and, on top of that\nand as explained in Chapter 2, the accuracy of the results given by the \u001cnite element method\nis related with the mesh re\u001cnement. However,\n\nRe\u001cne is usually not su\u001ecient to generate an\n\nacceptable skeleton, and needs to be combined with other methods.\nThe user must de\u001cne the elements that should be considered, namely, elements with an area\nsmaller than a given value can be excluded from further re\u001cnement. It is also needed to specify\nthe edges of the elements that should be re\u001cned and how these edges are re\u001cned (bisected or\ntrisected). During the\n\nRe\u001cne method, OOF2 enables the possibility to keep the elements shape,\n\ni.e quadrilaterals can be re\u001cned into smaller quadrilaterals, and triangular elements likewise.\n\nSnap Re\u001cne -\n\nSimilar to\n\nRe\u001cne and Snap Nodes, this algorithm attempts to subdivide\n\nheterogeneous elements by spawning new nodes in the transition points that are located in the\nmaterial boundaries, instead of just bisecting or trisecting the edges on a equal manner.\n\n50\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nSnap Re\u001cne usually improves the homogeneity energy of the skeleton without creating as\nmany nodes as Re\u001cne does, because it directly splits elements in the relevant points. However,\nit is important not to overuse this routine, since it tends to create badly shaped elements after a\nfew iterations. The user is able to de\u001cne a speci\u001cc distance from an existing node, below which\n\nSnap Re\u001cne does not create a new one, preventing the aforementioned problem, although this\nsolution is not always applicable.\n\nRe\u001cne \u001crst and then, when the element's size is good enough, use Snap\nRe\u001cne to better resolve the singularities of the microstructure. Rationalize and Smooth after\nThe user should use\n\nthis routine has been proven to be a good methodology to prevent thin elements generated by\n\nSnap Re\u001cne.\n\nRationalize -\n\nAs mentioned while explaining the other routines,\n\nRationalize is the most\n\npowerful method to clean up badly shaped elements. It either removes them or simply modi\u001ces\n\nshape energy. When a previous routine generates\nelements with sharp angles or with high aspect-ratios, using Rationalize improves the skeleton\nthem and their surroundings to decrease the\n\nquality.\nThis algorithm has three sub-algorithms:\n\n1. Remove short sides - This sub-routine eliminates the shortest edge of a quad element\nby replacing it with a triangular one.\n\nThe user de\u001cnes a ratio and, if the fraction\n\nbetween the size of the shortest side and the second shortest side of the quadrilateral\nelement is greater than this value, the nodes that belong to this edge are merged. If\nthe element that shares these nodes is a quadrilateral,\n\nRationalize transforms it into\n\na triangle but it can also be eliminated if it was already a triangle;\n\n2. Split wide quads - If a quadrilateral element has large interior angles (value speci\u001ced\nby the user), this sub-routine divides it into two triangles and, consequently, improves\nthe\n\nshape energy of the system;\n\n3. Remove bad triangles - This sub-routine is probably the most important and relevant\none. Thin elements are responsible for a bad convergence behaviour during the \u001cnite\nelement analysis and, along the deformation process, they can degenerate into illegal\nelements and interrupt the analysis or produce incorrect information. The user can\nde\u001cne an angular range, and all triangles with interior angles outside that range are\neither eliminated or have their surroundings replaced by a set of new ones.\n\nIt is important to note that this algorithm is applied with the order presented above and it\nis possible to select the target elements in order to get a lower computational time. The tunable\nparameter Î± also plays a major role on the results given by this routine, since it de\u001cnes if the\npriority is the\n\nshape or homogeneity energy.\n\nChapter 4.\n\nDigital Image Based Microstructure Recognition\n\nMerge Triangles -\n\n51\n\nLinear triangular elements are known for presenting a constant strain\n\ninside its domain, which is a simpli\u001ccation of the real behaviour of a material. If it is possible,\na quadrilateral element should be used instead of a triangular one.\n\nMerge Triangles merges two triangular elements to form a quadrilateral\none. It improves the shape energy of the system and reduces the total number of elements,\nAs the name implies,\n\ndecreasing the duration of the \u001cnite element analysis.\n\nSplit Quads and Swap Edges -\n\nThese two routines are used when a skeleton is near\n\nits \u001cnal version but there are some elements along the material boundaries that need to be\nimproved to better represent the microstructure.\nIn the case of\n\nSplit Quads, when a quadrilateral element has two of its opposite corners on\n\ntop of a material boundary, this means that the material boundary passes thorough one of the\ndiagonals of this element and so, by dividing the element into two triangles, the\n\nhomogeneity\n\nenergy is decreased.\nSwap Edges takes into consideration both types of elements (triangular and quads) and, if\na shared edge of a pair of elements crosses a material boundary, this routine tries to improve\n\nhomogeneity by merging two triangles into one quadrilateral and dividing it along its other\ndiagonal. It can also improve the shape energy of two adjacent quadrilaterals by swapping its\n\ntheir\n\ninternal common edge.\n\nFix Illegal Elements -\n\nA skeleton cannot be converted into a \u001cnite element mesh if it\n\ncontains illegal elements. Firstly, it is important to de\u001cne an illegal element as an element that\nhas corners with an angle greater than 180Â° or less than 0Â°. Non-convex shapes are also part of\nit.\n\nFix Illegal Elements routine does not take into account the homogeneity and shape energy.\nSimilarly to Smooth, it attempts to move the node of the illegal corner to the average position\nof its surroundings and if it fails, it attempts to move the other nodes of the element to see if\nthe illegal element is removed. To either accept or reject the attempted movement, this routine\nonly veri\u001ces if the illegal elements in the vicinity of the node are removed or not.\nIt is advised to check if the skeleton continues to be a good representation of the microstructure after resorting to this routine.\n\nAs previously introduced, OOF2 has an automated procedure to generate a \u001crst version\n\nMortar\nPeriodic boundary condition (Section 3.4.4) is going to be used instead of the Periodic constraint, this condition is set to false. After having de\u001cned the parameters maxscale, minscale\nand homogeneity threshold, this automated script follows a speci\u001cc sequence of routines.\nFirstly, it creates a skeleton grid with quadrilaterals of size equal to maxscale. The Re\u001cne\n\nof a skeleton.\n\nIt is possible to de\u001cne the output skeleton as periodic, but, since the\n\nroutine is then used to iteratively re\u001cne the initial grid, by bissecting the edges with Î± = 0.8. As\naddressed earlier, all re\u001cnement operations are only applied to the elements with size greater\nthan\n\nminscale or with homogeneity lower than the speci\u001ced homogeneity threshold, and the\n\n52\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\niterations are repeated until there is an element with linear dimensions smaller than the\nparameter. Once the\n\nminscale\n\nRe\u001cne routine is \u001cnished, the Snap Re\u001cne routine is applied once to place\n\nthe nodes and edges on the boundaries of the materials. Since these routines usually generate\n\nRationalize routine is used twice to remove these elements. Lastly,\nusing the Pin Nodes function, the internal boundary nodes are locked and a Smooth routine is\nbadly shaped elements, the\n\napplied for 5 iterations with Î± = 0.3.\nThis procedure is able to create a su\u001eciently good \u001crst stage skeleton. Nevertheless, there\nare cases where several routines must be used to further improve the\n\nenergy after this step.\n\nshape and homogeneity\n\n4.2.5 Output Files of OOF2\nAs the name of the program suggests (\"Object Oriented Finite Elements\"), OOF2 is an objected\noriented program since it works with classes and sub-classes. The main objects are\n\nMicrostruc-\n\ntures, Images, Skeletons, Meshes and SubProblems. OOF2 also runs \u001cnite element analysis,\nsubdividing Meshes into SubProblems but this is not related with the scope of this thesis, since\nthis analysis is going to be done in a di\u001berent program - MSP.\nWhile the user is generating the DIB \u001cnite element mesh, the user can can save di\u001berent\nparts of the work for later retrieval. The main idea is that the \u001cle extension has to be the same\n\nSkeleton information, \".microstructure\" saves the Microstructure information, \".material\" saves the Material\nas the object (or class) name that is going to be saved (e.g. \".skeleton\" saves the\n\ninformation, and so on).\nIf the \".microstructure\" \u001cle is created, only the\n\nImages, the pixel groups and the Material\n\nMap (that contains the information of the material assigned to each pixel) are saved. The\n\".skeleton\" \u001cle, besides the information contained in the Microstructure class, also contains the\nskeleton information. Lastly, the \".mesh\" \u001cle contains the Skeleton class, but also the \u001cnite\nelement mesh information. More information regarding OOF2 structure can be found on OOF2\nManual (Technology, 2016).\nIn the last sections, the procedure to obtain the \u001cnal version of the skeleton that \u001cts into\nthe microstructure's geometry is explained. After that, the \u001cnite element mesh is created and\nbuilt upon the skeleton's geometry.\nAlong the creation of the \u001cnite element mesh, OOF2 asks the order of the mapping and\n\n10 . The mapping functions are responsible for mapping the coordinates\n\ninterpolating functions\n\nof the \u001cnite elements from the physical to the natural space (parametric coordinates Î¶ ) and vice\nversa and can either be linear or quadratic. The interpolation functions are used to interpolate\nthe displacement \u001celd within elements and can also be linear or quadratic. The combination of\ndi\u001berent orders in these functions generate di\u001berent possibilities and, in Table 4.2, the di\u001berent\noptions provided by OOF2 to create the \u001cnite element mesh are presented. Their de\u001cnition is\ndirectly obtained from the OOF2 program:\n\n10\n\nSee Section 2.6.2 for more information.\n\nChapter 4.\n\nDigital Image Based Microstructure Recognition\n\n53\n\nÂˆ T3_3 - Isoparametric 3 noded triangle with linear interpolation for both \u001celds and positions;\n\nÂˆ Q4_4 - Isoparametric 4 noded quadrilateral with bilinear interpolation for both positions\nand \u001celds;\n\nÂˆ T3_6 - Subparametric 6 noded triangle with linear interpolation for positions and quadratic\ninterpolation for \u001celds;\n\nÂˆ Q4_8 - Subparametric 8 noded quadrilateral with bilinear interpolation for positions and\nquadratic interpolation for \u001celds;\n\nÂˆ T6_6 - Isoparametric 6 noded triangle with quadratic interpolation for both positions\nand \u001celds;\n\nÂˆ Q8_8 - Isoparametric 8 noded quadrilateral with quadratic interpolation for both positions and \u001celds;\n\nÂˆ Q9_9 - Isoparametric 9 noded quadrilateral with quadratic interpolation for both positions and \u001celds.\n\nTable 4.2: Options provided by OOF2 to generate the \u001cnite element mesh based on the skeleton\ngeometry.\n\nMapping\nOrder\n1\n\nInterpolating Order\n1\n\n2\n\nT3_3\n\nT3_6\n\nQ4_4\n\nQ4_8\nT6_6\n\n2\n\n-\n\nQ8_8\nQ9_9\n\nIn the MSP program, only the isoparametric elements are admissible, thus, the mapping\norder must be equal to the interpolating order.\nFurthermore, it is possible to keep saving the progress on a couple of di\u001berent formats:\n\nÂˆ Script - This format saves a \u001cle that contains the OOF2 commands as a Python\n\nÂ®\n\nscript.\n\nThis type of \u001cle can be edited to modify or insert new commands. It is important to note\nthat, since this \u001cle is interpreted by a Python\n\nÂ®\n\nany malicious Python\n\nÂ®\n\ninterpreter, the security is low because\n\nprogram can be disguised as an OOF2 script;\n\nÂˆ Ascii - Similar to the script type \u001cle, the ascii \u001cle format contains the commands in\nPython\n\nÂ®\n\nÂ®\n\ncode but it is not processed by the Python\n\ninterpreter, and so, it does not\n\npresent any security risk. The routines that read this type of \u001cle only understand OOF2\ncommands.\n\n54\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nÂˆ Binary - The binary \u001cle format is faster to read and write and don't have any security\nproblems.\n\nSince the whole data is saved in binary code, this type of \u001cles are more\n\naccurate. However, they cannot be edited in a text editor.\n\nÂˆ Abaqus - Only skeletons and meshes can be stored in this type of format. As the name\n\nÂ®\n\nimplies, this \u001cle allows the user to insert the data in the Abaqus\n\nnite element program.\n\nThe information regarding nodes and elements is stored in a tabular environment.\n\nDuring the work of this thesis, the \u001cnite element mesh is saved in the\n\nÂ®\n\nThen, a MATLAB\n\nAbaqus format \u001cle.\n\nscript (described in Appendix B) is developed to read the information\n\ncontained in this \u001cle and, write an output \u001cle to be read by the MSP program.\n\nNote: It is advised to save the progress whenever is possible, since OOF2 tends to crash some\ntimes.\n\nIf the user does not want to change anything on the save \u001cle, the\n\nBinary format is\n\nadvised.\n\n4.3 Example of a DIB Microstructure Recognition using OOF2\nIn this section, the whole procedure to create a \u001cnite element mesh with DIB microstructure\nrecognition is reviewed with the help of a simple example. The micrograph that serves as base\nto this example is presented in Figure 4.7.\n\nFigure 4.7: Image sample from a microstructure: A micrometer scale SEM image of plasmaetched Si3 Na4 (Reid et al., 2008).\n\nAs demonstrated in Figure 4.8, by selecting the button \"New from Image File\", OOF2\nenables the creation of a microstructure based on a rasterized image \u001cle\n\n11 .\n\nBy selecting this\n\nbutton, the menu displayed in Figure 4.9 appears and the selection of the image \u001cle occurs.\nIn this step, a name and physical height and width dimensions can also be assigned to the\n\n11\n\nAn image that its represented by a grid of pixels, each of which has a number of bits to designate its color.\n\nChapter 4.\n\nDigital Image Based Microstructure Recognition\n\n55\n\nmicrostructure. It is noteworthy to mention that, if these characteristics are not user-de\u001cned,\nOOF2 will automatically create a name and assign pixel dimensions to the microstructure.\n\nFigure 4.8: Creating a microstructure from an image \u001cle.\n\nFigure 4.9: Selecting the image \u001cle and de\u001cning the physical dimensions of the RVE.\n\nFinally, the microstructure is created and its information can be seen in the OOF2\n\nMi-\n\ncrostructure window (Figure 4.10). In this \u001cgure, it is also demonstrated that the pixel groups\nare not yet de\u001cned.\n\nTherefore, as explained in Section 4.2.2, this image has to be segmented in two di\u001berent\nmaterials: the\n\nBlack and the White material. However, the material boundaries are blurry\n\nand the material parts are not well de\u001cned, and so, an image treatment is needed before the\nsegmentation can begin.\nThe image treatment procedure hereafter explained is based on a tutorial provided by OOF2.\n\n4.3.1 Image Treatment\nBy applying\n\nNormalize, the initial image is normalized, meaning that the gray code values \u001cll\n\nthe full range from black to white (0 to 255) and, the result is presented in Figure 4.11a. After\n\n56\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nFigure 4.10: Information about the microstructure and pixel groups.\n\nthat, the\n\nContrast function is used three times to improve the de\u001cnition of both materials, as\n\nthe darker and brighter regions get darker and brighter, respectively (Figure 4.11b).\n\n(a) Applying the Normalize tool.\n\n(b) Applying the Contrast tool three times.\n\nFigure 4.11: Image treatment of Figure 4.7 to better de\u001cne both materials.\n\nIn Figure 4.11b, both materials are well de\u001cned. However, there is a part of the microstructure where exists\n\nWhite material but, due to the Contrast tool, this part became darker. This\n\nminor problem will be solved during the pixel's selection step.\n\n4.3.2 Image Segmentation\nColor method is going to be used to segment it into\ntwo di\u001berent pixel groups: Black and White. The color range value is given by a gray code\nparameter, delta gray, and it is set to 0.5 while the target pixel is any black pixel. Figure 4.12\n\nSince Figure 4.7 is a gray-scale image, the\n\nshows the resulting selection in red.\nIn Figure 4.12 it can be noticed that there is a \"path\" connecting two black grains that is\nalso selected. This \"path\" should belong to the\n\nWhite group and not to the Black one and,\n\nChapter 4.\n\nDigital Image Based Microstructure Recognition\n\nFigure 4.12: Selection of the black pixels using the\n\n57\n\nColor method.\n\nto solve this problem, the selection is inverted (Figure 4.13a) and the pixels in the \"path\" are\nselected using the\n\nBrush tool with a circle of radius12 = 0.25 (Figure 4.13b).\n\n(a) The selection displayed in Figure 4.12 is (b) Using the Brush tool, the \"path\" between\ninverted.\nthe two black grains is selected.\nFigure 4.13: Correction of the selection shown in Figure 4.12.\n\nWhite material is selected, the user needs to create the White pixel\ngroup by clicking \"New...\" in the Microstructure window of OOF2 and then, add the selected\nNow that the whole\n\npixels to the new pixel group by clicking \"Add\".\nand the\n\nBlack group is created in the same way.

The materials\nare named\n\nBlack_mat and White_mat for easier comprehension and, both of them are of bulk\n\n13 are presented in\n\ntype. In this case, both materials are considered isotropic and their properties\n\nTable 4.3. A color property is also added to better distinguish both materials and the skeleton\nlines.\nTable 4.3: Material properties assigned in OOF2.\n\nBlack_mat\nWhite_mat\n\nYoung's Modulus Poisson's Ratio Color\n100 GPa\n\n0.3\n\n0.8\n\n10 GPa\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nSecondly, these properties are added on the same\n\nMaterials window (Figure 4.15).\n\nTo\n\ncreate them, one has to click in \"Copy...\" with \"Isotropic\" (inside the folder \"Mechanical\"\nand sub-folder \"Elasticity\") or \"Color\" selected.

Using the button \"Add Property to Material\",\n\nBlack_elast and Black_color are added to Black_mat and White_elast and White_color are\nadded to White_mat.\nFinally, the materials have to be assigned to the pixel groups. By clicking on the button\n\"Assign Material to Pixels...\" the\n\nWhite groups, respectively.\n13\n\nBlack_mat and White_mat are attached to the Black and\n\nThe assigned properties are not representative of the plasma-etched Si3 Na4 .\n\nChapter 4.\n\nDigital Image Based Microstructure Recognition\n\n59\n\nFigure 4.15: Material properties assigned in OOF2.\n\nFigure 4.16:\n\nMaterial image of the already segmented microstructure.\n\nThe new segmented image can be seen on a new layer created in the\nis known as a\n\nGraphics window. This\n\nmaterial image and its representation is displayed in Figure 4.16.\n\n4.3.3 Generation of the Skeleton Geometry\nAfter having completed the image segmentation process, the user can create the skeleton that\nwill later be converted into the \u001cnite element mesh. As addressed in Section 4.2.4, OOF2 has an\nautomated script that is available by clicking on the \"Auto...\" button of the\n\nSkeleton window.\n\n14 are set as maxscale = 0.4, minscale = 0.3 and homogeneity\nFor this case, the parameters\n\nthreshold = 0.9 and the result in presented in Figure 4.17.\n\nAs it can be seen from Figure 4.17, the automated script of OOF2 generates a fairly good\nskeleton but several elements need to be treated to better represent both materials.\n\n14\n\nMaxscale and minscale are de\u001cned in physical dimensions. If, while creating the microstructure, the physical\ndimensions are not de\u001cned, these parameters have to be de\u001cned in pixel dimensions.\n\n60\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\n(a) Representation of the materials' color.\n\n(b) Representation of the elements' color.\n\nFigure 4.17: Initial skeleton created by the automated script of OOF2.\n\nFigure 4.18: Final skeleton with the elements' color represented.\n\nAfter running a couple of routines, like\n\nMerge Triangles, Split Quads, Swap Edges, Ratio-\n\nnalize and Smooth (with the internal boundary nodes locked in their position), it is possible\nto achieve the \u001cnal version of the skeleton, presented in Figure 4.18.\nthe\n\nThe sub-algorithms of\n\nRationalize routine are applied with tighter constraints than those used in the automated\n\nscript of OOF2. Therefore, triangular and quadrilateral elements that were tolerated during the\ninitial procedure are replaced by elements with lower\n\nshape energy. Moreover, in Figure 4.17b,\n\nthere are some defected elements presented in the boundaries of the interior clusters that are\ncorrected in the \u001cnal version of the skeleton.\n\n4.3.4 Generation of the Finite Element Mesh\nAs addressed on Section 4.2.5, OOF2 enables the creation of isoparametric and subparametric\nelements of linear or quadratic order for both mapping and interpolation functions.\n\nIn this\n\nChapter 4.\n\nDigital Image Based Microstructure Recognition\n\n61\n\nexample, the elements chosen are of linear order for both functions (T3_3 and Q4_4) (Figure 4.19). The \"2-cornered\" elements are not addressed because, when saving the \u001cle in the\n\nAbaqus format, their information is not contained, only the quadrilateral and triangular elements matter in this case. The \u001cnal numbers of elements and nodes are displayed in Table 4.4.\n\nFigure 4.19: Selecting the order for both mapping and interpolation functions and creating the\nnite element mesh.\n\nTable 4.4: Information about the \u001cnal version of the \u001cnite element mesh.\n\nType\nElements\n\nNumber\n2303\n\nQuadrilateral\n\n935\n\nTriangular\n\n1368\n\nNodes\nHomogeneity\n\n1687\n0.9815\n\n4.4 Example of a DIB Microstructure Recognition using OOF3D\nAs mentioned, the same developers of OOF2, have created a program that generates \u001cnite\nelement meshes based on 3D RVEs - OOF3D. The procedure is in all similar as the one described\nfor OOF2 with the replacement of the pixel concept for voxel.\nRegarding 3D images, one has to think of them as a group of 2D images that may be\ninterpreted as di\u001berent layers. Therefore, if the 2D images that characterize the 3D RVE are\nequal, it is the same as considering that the RVE is an extruded version of the 2D RVE, as\nillustrated in Figure 4.20.\nIn this section, a brief example of the procedure followed to generate the \u001cnite element\nmesh of a 3D RVE is presented. The RVE chosen is given by OOF3D as an example \u001cle. It\ncharacterizes a bone structure and it is not an extruded image, meaning that each 2D layer\nis represented by a di\u001berent image. Since it is only composed by voxels of two colors (black\nand white), the image segmentation is simple: it can be performed by the voxel selection\n\nColor\n\n62\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\n(a) 3D micrograph.\n\n(b) Material image.\n\nFigure 4.20: Image segmentation of an extruded 3D RVE of the microstrucutre displayed in\nFigure 4.7.\n\nmethod or through the \"Group\"\n\n15 button in the Image window.\n\nThe initial RVE and the\n\nmaterial image are displayed in Figure 4.21.\n\n(a) 3D micrograph.\n\n(b) Material image.\n\nFigure 4.21: Image segmentation of a 3D RVE that represents a bone structure. The lighter\nand the darker material represent the bone and porosity, respectively.\n\nOOF3D does not have an automated script to create a \u001crst skeleton version like OOF2 does,\nthus, the initial skeleton is created as a grid of 10 Ã— 10 Ã— 10 tetrahedral elements. After that, the\n\nRe\u001cne routine is applied (Î± = 0.8) on the elements with homogeneity lower than 0.95 and the\nSnap Nodes tool is used to move the nodes to the material boundaries (homogeneity threshold\n= 0.9 and Î± = 0.9). A higher re\u001cnement is performed on the darker part and the Rationalize\n15\n\nThis function groups pixels/voxels of di\u001berent colors into di\u001berent groups. It usually does not lead to a good\nresult due to the pixels/voxels of di\u001berent gray shades that may exist.\n\nChapter 4.\n\nDigital Image Based Microstructure Recognition\n\nroutine is used to lower the\n\n63\n\nshape energy and to eliminate unneeded elements. To \u001cnalise, the\n\nSmooth routine is applied for 10 iterations with Î± = 0.15 and with the internal boundary nodes\nlocked on their positions. The \u001cnal mesh version is presented in Figure 4.22.\n\nFigure 4.22: Finite element mesh that models the RVE displayed in Figure 4.21.\n\nFinally, some problems occurred while exploring the functionalities of OOF3D. The program\nis an extended version of OOF2 for three dimensional problems but it is not as developed and\ntested as the 2D version. For instance, the number of adaptive methods to generate and re\u001cne\nthe mesh is low and the type of elements that can be used is limited to tetrahedrons (the\ndevelopers aim to introduce hexahedral elements in the future).\nFurthermore, while saving the \u001cle that contains the \u001cnite element mesh data in\nformat to be later converted with MATLAB\nnot save any \u001cle.\n\nÂ®\n\nAbaqus\n\nand used in MSP, the program crashes, or does\n\nDue to this problem, it was not possible to use OOF3D to perform a 3D\n\nnite element analysis. Even so, this section demonstrated the use of this program to generate\na \u001cnite element mesh based on a 3D micrograph to reinforce that, in the future, this type of\nmethodology may be available to use.\n\n4.5 Special Notes\nThere is always a learning process that needs to be respected while getting in contact with\na new program. In the \u001crst DIB microstructure recognitions with OOF2, there were several\nproblems that, with the experience gained throughout the thesis, have been solved.\n\nIn this\n\nsection, special notes and tips are presented to avoid some errors, and to, overall be more\ne\u001ecient while working with OOF2 (and OOF3D).\n\n64\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nÂˆ The adaptive methods used to generate and re\u001cne the \u001cnite element mesh should be used\nwith the graphics window closed. This will decrease the time taken to complete the routines, since OOF2 prints the skeleton information (nodes, elements) in the graphics window every time a change is made. This greatly increases the time consumed per routine\n(probably doubling or more), and is even more severe as the amount of nodes/elements\nbecomes bigger;\n\nÂˆ When trying to zoom in/out or pan over the image in the graphics window, it is advised\nto uncheck the layers that contain the skeleton or mesh information, to again lower the\ntime consumed by the operation;\n\nÂˆ OOF2 tends to sometimes crash without warning, showing a \"Segmentation Fault (Core\nDumped)\" error in the terminal window. This usually occurs when OOF2 tries to access\ndata that is not allocated in memory. To prevent this error, the user must reselect the\nrelevant nodes and elements targeted by a routine after a non-topology preserving routine\nis applied. For instance, in the case that the user selects the elements with\nhigher than 0.8 to apply the\n\nshape energy\n\nRationalize routine and, after that, it wants to apply, for\n\nSmooth routine to the same type of elements, the selection must occur again\nbecause in the Rationalize routine several elements may have been eliminated and the\nSmooth function will try to access elements or nodes that don't exist. However, OOF2\nexample, the\n\nsaves a log \u001cle in the temp folder of the computer that can be loaded as a script \u001cle to\nrecover the work lost;\n\nÂˆ The user should save the skeleton in binary format after major operations. If possible,\nkeeping two di\u001berent versions and always saving the last step on a di\u001berent one is a\ngood practice to prevent losing all the information when OOF2 crashes while saving and\noverwriting the info, leading to a corrupt \u001cle;\n\nÂˆ As mentioned in Section 4.2.5, OOF2 enables the user to load a Python\n\nÂ®\n\nscript (\".py\"\n\nle extension) that includes the command lines for the program to follow. With this, it\nis possible and advised to write the desired routines in advance and load the script to\nturn the procedure more automatic.\n\n4.6 Conclusions\nDespite the fact that the open-source programs used to generate the \u001cnite element mesh based\non real micrographs are still under development regarding memory e\u001eciency and debugging,\nthe DIB microstructure recognition technique presents an innovation on how materials with\ncomplex microstructures are analysed. The possibility of creating a model that analyses and\ncaptures each given real microstructure and not only simpli\u001ced representations of it, is inspiring\nand may be considered as a promising feature in the development of new materials.\n\nChapter 5\nMethods for the Determination of\nHomogenized Elastic Properties\n\nIt is well known, the majority of materials tend to deform in the elastic domain before reaching\nplasticity. This means that a body that has only been strained in the elastic domain, returns\nto its initial con\u001cguration after being unloaded.\n\nIf, on the other hand, during deformation\n\nplasticity has been reached, the material will stay with permanent deformation, which can be\nrelieved by some heat treatments (e.g. annealing and tempering).\nThe set of equations that relates stress with strain (and possibly strain history, strain rate\nand other \u001celds quantities) are called\n\nconstitutive equations but, unlike the governing equations\n\npresented in Chapter 2, these cannot be usually calculated using fundamental physical relations.\nInstead, constitutive equations are related with experimental measurements. In this way, it is\nhelpful to review the basic assumptions taken to develop the stress-strain laws:\n\nÂˆ A small sample extracted from the solid has uniform properties;\nÂˆ When the solid is deformed, lines that are initially straight in the solid are deformed into\nsmooth curves (with continuous slope);\n\nÂˆ Short segments of these lines (much shorter than the radius of curvature of the curves) are\njust stretched and rotated by deformation, implying that the deformation of a su\u001eciently\nsmall volume element can be characterized by a deformation gradient;\n\nÂˆ The stress that occurs at point in the solid depends only in the change of shape of an\nextremely small volume element that surrounds it. Therefore, it must be a function of\nthe deformation gradient or a strain measure that derives from it.\nThese assumptions are approximations because materials are not uniform at small scales,\nwhether it is at the inter atomic or microstructural level.\n\nTherefore, the elastic range, well\n\nde\u001cned for the vast majority of homogeneous materials, is a\u001bected by materials with complex\n65\n\n66\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nmicrostructures. Thus, there is an high dependency between the elastic properties of porous\nand composite materials and their microstructures. Experimental procedures can be used to\nnd out these properties but the monetary costs inherent to them are high, and so, in this\nchapter, several analytical methods that aim to solve this problem are introduced. Moreover,\na numerical procedure that consists on applying di\u001berent loads (pure strain and pure shear\ndeformations) to an RVE that correctly represents a microstructure (created by the DIB microstructure recognition technique presented in Chapter 4) is described. This method improves\nthe accuracy of the results since it takes into account the real microstructure's geometry.\nIn order to better understand the elasticity concept, the generalized\n\nHooke's Law must be\n\nintroduced, along with the elastic constants that are generally utilized. Greater attention will\nbe given to orthotropic, transversely isotropic and isotropic materials. All of this information\ncan be found on Lai et al. (2010), Bower (2010) and Hwu (2010).\n\n5.1 Hooke's Law\nTo formulate the elastic behaviour of a material under small deformations, the 4th-order compliance tensor,\n\nS, and the 4th-order sti\u001bness tensor, C, also named as elasticity tensor, must be\n\nintroduced as the linear map between the 2nd-order strain and stress tensors. This is mathematically expressed by the generalized\n\nHooke's Law,\nÎμ = S : Ïƒ,\n\nbeing\n\nC the inverse tensor of S,\n\n(5.1a)\n\nÏƒ = C : Îμ,\n\n(5.1b)\n\nC = Sâˆ’1 .\n\n(5.2)\n\nA 4th-order tensor has 81 components but, in a linearly elastic body, due to symmetry\nrelations that exist in the strain and stress tensors, Ïƒ\ntensors,\n\nS and C, have minor symmetry,\n\n= Ïƒ T and Îμ = ÎμT , both constitutive\n\n(Â·)ijkl = (Â·)jikl = (Â·)ijlk\n\n(5.3)\n\nhence, the number of independent components is reduced to 36.\nFurthermore, it is assumed that the concept of elasticity is related with the capacity of the\nmaterials to store energy which is denoted as\n\nU=\n\nstrain energy function,\n\n1\nC : Îμ : Îμ,\n2\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhich is a positive de\u001cnite function of the strain components such that,\n\nÏƒ=\n\nâˆ‚U\n.\nâˆ‚Îμ\n\n(5.5)\n\nChapter 5.\n\nMethods for the Determination of Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\n67\n\nWith this assumption, it is possible to prove that the constitutive tensors also have major\nsymmetry,\n\n(Â·)ijkl = (Â·)klij ,\n\n(5.6)\n\nand, consequently, the number of independent elastic constants decreases to 21, characteristic\nof a material with generalized anisotropic behaviour.\nConsidering these properties, it is possible to de\u001cne the\nfollowing the\n\nVoigt notation:\nï£± ï£1⁄4\nï£ ́\nÏƒ11 ï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́Ïƒ22 ï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£2Ïƒ ï£ ́\nï£1⁄2\n\nï£®\n\nHooke's Law in a matrix basis\nï£1ï£± ï£1⁄4\nï£ ́\nï£ ́Îμ11 ï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£oï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nC2212 ï£o\nÎμ\n22\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£oï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£o\nï£2\nC3312 ï£o Îμ33 ï£1⁄2\n,\nï£o\nï£ ́\nC2312 ï£o\nï£ ́Î323 ï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£oï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́Î3 ï£ ́\nï£ ́\nC1312 ï£o\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\n13 ï£ ́\nï£»ï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nC1212 ï£3Î312 ï£3⁄4\n\nC1111 C1122 C1133 C1123 C1113 C1112\n\nï£ ̄\nï£ ̄\nï£ ̄\nï£ ̄\n33\nï£ ̄\n=ï£ ̄\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nÏƒ\nï£ ́\nï£ ́ ï£ ̄\n23 ï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ̄\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ̄\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nÏƒ\nï£ ́\n13 ï£ ́\nï£°\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£3Ïƒ ï£3⁄4\nsym.\n12\n\nC2222 C2233 C2223 C2213\nC3333 C3323 C3313\nC2323 C2313\nC1313\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere,\n\nÎ323 = 2Îμ23\nare the\n\nÎ313 = 2Îμ13\n\nÎ312 = 2Îμ12\n\n(5.8)\n\nengineering shear strains.

The simplicity\nof these equations implies that the results obtained with them are not of much practical use\nbut, in contrast with higher-order bounds (e.g.\n\nHashin-Shtrikman Bounds ), they also hold for\n\nvolume elements that are to small to be regarded RVEs. Nevertheless, neither of these models\n\nVoigt model violates equilibrium due to the implied traction across the\nphase boundaries and the Reuss model generates strains that would force the debounding of\nthe phases. In tensorial form, Hill Bounds (Hill, 1952) can be expressed as:\nare correct, because the\n\nï£®\nï£1âˆ’1\nX\nX\nCâˆ—R = ï£° Ï†i Si ï£» â‰¤ Câˆ— â‰¤ Ï†i Ci = Câˆ—V\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(5.33)\n\nChapter 5.\n\nwhere\n\nMethods for the Determination of Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\n75\n\nCâˆ— is the homogenized (or e\u001bective) sti\u001bness tensor, Câˆ—R and Câˆ—V are the estimated e\u001bective\n\ntensors given by the\n\nReuss and Voigt models and Ï†i is the volume fraction of phase i. More\n\ninformation about these models can be found on Berryman (2004) and BÃ¶hm (2016).\n\nVoigt Model\nThe\n\nVoigt model, (also known as the rule of mixtures ) is the upper boundary and takes into\n\naccount that the applied load causes equal strains in both phases of the composite and so, the\noverall composite stress is the sum of the stresses carried out by each phase.\nThus, the composite e\u001bective sti\u001bness tensor can be calculated by:\n\nf\nâˆ—\nm\nCijkl\n= Ï†f Cijkl\n+ Ï†m Cijkl\n,\n\n(5.34)\n\nwhere Ï†f and Ï†m represent the \u001cber and matrix volume fraction, respectively.\nConsidering an isotropic composite material, an isotropic matrix with Em and an isotropic\n\nâˆ—\n\nber with Ef as Young's modulus, the overall Young's modulus, E , given by the\n\nVoigt model\n\nis the average of the constituents' moduli weighted by the volume fraction of each phase,\n\nE âˆ— = Ï†f Ef + Ï†m Em ,\n\n(5.35)\n\nwhere, usually, Ï†f + Ï†m = 1. Expression (5.35) assumes that the constituents have Poisson's\nratios that lead to equal Poisson contractions.\n\nReuss Model\nReuss model corresponds to the lower boundary and is known as the inverse rule of mixtures\nor the rule of mixtures for the compliance components. It formulates the case when each phase\nThe\n\nof the composite carries an equal stress.\n\nIn this way, the compliance e\u001bective tensor for the\n\ncomposite is given by:\n\nf\nâˆ—\nm\nSijkl\n= Ï†f Sijkl\n+ Ï†m Sijkl\n,\n\n(5.36)\n\nConsequently, in a isotropic material, the overall strain in the composite is the sum of the\n\nâˆ—\n\nnet strain carried out by each phase and the e\u001bective Young's modulus, E , given by the\nmodel is denoted as:\n\nEâˆ— =\n\n\u0012\n\nÏ†f\nÏ†m\n+\nEf\nEm\n\nReuss\n\n\u0013âˆ’1\n.\n\n(5.37)\n\nExpression (5.37) assumes that the constituents have Poisson's ratios that lead to equal Poisson\ncontractions.\n\n5.2.2 Modi\u001ced Rule of Mixtures\nModi\u001ced Rule of Mixtures (Nakamura et al., 2000) is an alternative method to the Voigt\nand Reuss boundaries. If the composite is treated as isotropic, its uniaxial stress and strain\nThe\n\n76\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\ncan be decomposed into:\n\nÏƒ = Ï†f Ïƒf + (1 âˆ’ Ï†f )Ïƒm ,\n\n(5.38a)\n\nÎμ = Ï†f Îμf + (1 âˆ’ Ï†f )Îμm ,\n\n(5.38b)\n\nwhere Ïƒf , Ïƒm and Îμf , Îμm are the stresses and strains of the \u001cbers and matrix under uniaxial\nstress and strain conditions.\nIf one takes into consideration the dimensionless parameter q , that characterizes the normalized ratio of the stress to strain transfer, de\u001cned by:\n\nq=\n\n1 Ïƒf âˆ’ Ïƒm\n,\nEf Îμf âˆ’ Îμm\n\nq âˆˆ [0, âˆž] ,\n\nand combines Equation (5.38) with (5.39), while considering E =\n\nâˆ—\n\nfollowing expression for the overall Young's modulus, E :\n\nEâˆ— =\n\n(5.39)\n\nÏƒ\n, it is possible to obtain the\nÎμ\n\nÏ†f Ef + (1 âˆ’ Ï†f )Em R\n,\nÏ†f + (1 âˆ’ Ï†f )R\n\n(5.40)\n\nwhere R is given by:\n\nR=\n\nq+1\n.\nEm\nq+\nEf\n\n(5.41)\n\nIn Figure 5.4, the evolution of Equations (5.40) and (5.41) is presented and, it is possible\nto note that choosing a null value for the stress-strain transfer parameter, q = 0, the equation\nis equal to the\n\nReuss Model and if q â†’ âˆž, the equation refers to the Voigt Model.\n\nThe parameter q is empirical and depends on many factors, including composition, microstructure arrangement, internal constraints, and others.\nThe modi\u001ced rule of mixtures can also be extended to elastic-plastic composites (Nakamura\net al., 2000), but it is not included since it is out of the scope of this work.\n\n5.2.3 Hashin and Shtrikman Bounds\nHashin and Shtrickman developed a set of tighter and more\nmeaningful boundaries than those of Hill Bounds (Voigt and Reuss ) for isotropic materials with\nThrough a variational approach,\n\narbitrary internal geometry (Hashin and Shtrikman, 1963).

Here K2 â‰¥ K1 and G2 â‰¥ G1 . In these expressions, it is assumed\nthat both phases are made of an isotropic material. It has been shown in Hashin (1962) that\nEquation (5.42a) is the exact result for the bulk modulus of a certain composite material that\nhas a matrix of phase 'one' material and spherical inclusions of phase 'two' material distributed\nin a particular way. Analogously, Expression (5.42b) gives the exact value for the bulk modulus\nif the matrix is of phase 'two' material and the spherical inclusions are of phase 'one' material.\nThese are the most restrictive bounds that can be given in terms of phase volume fraction and\nphase moduli.

It has been shown in\nEshelby (1957) that, in these type of problems, if one applies uniform stresses or strains to the\nsystem at in\u001cnity, the stress and strain \u001celds in the inclusion are uniform, respectively, and\nso, the elastic properties can be determined by relating the far-\u001celd stresses and strains in the\nhomogeneous medium with those found on the inclusion.\nIn order to \u001cnd the e\u001bective properties of such system, Hill (1965) and Budiansky (1965)\nassume an initially homogeneous matrix into which inclusions of a di\u001berent material have been\nplaced, i.e. the inclusions can be considered embedded in the matrix, creating a \u001cctitious matrix, and so the in\u001cnite medium is taken to be homogeneous with the same properties of the\ncomposite. For an elastic matrix, the Hill's\n\nSelf-Consistent scheme is denoted by:\n\nÏƒ c âˆ’ Ïƒ 0 = âˆ’Lâˆ— : (Îμc âˆ’ Îμ0 ),\nwhere Ïƒ\nand Îμ\n\n(5.50)\n\n0 and Îμ0 de\u001cne the far-\u001celd stress and strain that are applied in the \u001cctitious matrix, Ïƒ c\n\nc are the stress and strain tensors in the inclusion, respectively and\n\nLâˆ— is the \"constraint\"\n\nChapter 5.\n\nMethods for the Determination of Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\ntensor de\u001cned by:\n\nLâˆ— = L : (S âˆ’ I),\n\nin which S is the Eshelby tensor,\n\n(5.51)\n\nI is the fourth-rank identity tensor,\nIijkl = Î ́ik Î ́lj +2 Î ́il Î ́kj ,\n\nwhere Î ́ is the\n\n81\n\n(5.52)\n\nKronecker delta function and L is the elastic tensor that relates Ïƒ 0 with Îμ0 ,\nÏƒ 0 = L : Îμ0 ,\n\n(5.53a)\n\nL = Ï†c Lc : Ac + (1 âˆ’ Ï†c )Lm : Am\n\n(5.53b)\n\nAc = [Lâˆ— + Lc ]âˆ’1 : Lâˆ— + L ,\n\n(5.54a)\n\nAm = [Lâˆ— + Lm ]âˆ’1 : Lâˆ— + L .\n\n(5.54b)\n\nand,\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\n\u0003\n\nIn Hill (1965) and Peng et al.

It was formulated\nunder both traction and displacement - prescribed boundary conditions, and in Benveniste\n(1987) it was proved that the e\u001bective moduli under both conditions is the same, i.e. there is\nno duality gap, common to these types of boundaries.\nThe key di\u001berence in this method is the assumption that the average strain in an inclusion,\n\nÎμc , (e.g. \u001cber) embedded in an all matrix material is related with the average strain in the\nmatrix, Îμm , by a fourth order tensor,\n\nAÌƒc ,\n\nÎμc = AÌƒc : Îμm ,\nwhere\n\nAÌƒc is the strain concentration factor tensor given by:\nAÌƒc = LÌƒâˆ— + Lc\nh\n\nand\n\n(5.59)\n\niâˆ’1 h âˆ—\ni\n: LÌƒ + Lm ,\n\n(5.60)\n\nLm , Lc are the elasticity tensors for both matrix and inclusion, respectively and LÌƒâˆ— is\n\ndenoted by:\n\nLÌƒâˆ— = Lm : Sâˆ’1 âˆ’ I ,\n\u0001\n\n(5.61)\n\nhence, the constitutive relations for both phases can be de\u001cned as,\n\nÏƒm = Lm : Îμm\n\n(5.62a)\n\nÏƒc = Lc : Îμc = Lc : AÌƒc : (Lm )âˆ’1 : Ïƒm .\n\n(5.62b)\n\nIt is shown in Weng (1984) that if one assumes an isotropic and elastic matrix and isotropic\nand elastic spherical inclusions, the e\u001bective properties of the composite material can be de\u001cned\nas:\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nï£1\nKc\nÏ†c\nâˆ’1\nï£ ̄\nï£o\nKm\nï£o,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n+\nK âˆ— = Km ï£ ̄\nï£»\nï£°\nKc\n1 + Î±(1 âˆ’ Ï†c )\nâˆ’1\nKm\nï£®\n\n\u0013\nï£1\nGc\nâˆ’\n1\nï£ ̄\nï£o\nGm\n\u0012\n\u0013ï£o\nGâˆ— = Gm ï£ ̄\nï£°1 +\nï£»,\nGc\n1 + Î2(1 âˆ’ Ï†c )\nâˆ’1\nGm\n\n(5.63a)\n\n\u0012\n\nï£®\n\nÏ†c\n\n(5.63b)\n\nwhere,\n\nÎ2=\n\n2(4 âˆ’ 5Î1⁄2m )\n,\n15(1 âˆ’ Î1⁄2m )\n\n(5.64a)\n\n84\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nÎ±=\n\n1 + Î1⁄2m\n,\n3(1 âˆ’ Î1⁄2m )\n\n(5.64b)\n\nÎ1⁄2m =\n\n3Km âˆ’ 2Gm\n.\n6Km + 2Gm\n\n(5.64c)\n\nand Î1⁄2m is the Poisson's ratio of the matrix phase.\nExpressions (5.63) in combination with Equation (5.57) were used to compute the e\u001bective\n\nMori-Tanaka model. Its representation and comparison with the\nHashin and Shtrikman and the Hill-Hashin bounds is presented in Figure 5.8. It is noteworthy\nto mention that the Mori-Tanaka model is enclosed by the Hill-Hashin bounds, meaning that\n\nYoung's modulus given by the\n\nâˆ—\n\nthe e\u001bective plane strain Young's modulus, Ep , can be estimated by this model.\nthe\n\nRegarding\n\nHashin and Shtrikman boundaries, the Mori-Tanaka model is coincident with its lower\n\nboundary. In Section 5.2.3, it is mentioned that Expression (5.42a) is the exact result for the\nbulk modulus of a certain composite material that has a matrix of phase 'one' material and\nspherical inclusions of phase 'two' material distributed in a particular way. This expression of\nthe\n\nMori-Tanaka model was obtained under the assumption of spherical inclusions, and so, it\n\nis normal that both of them coincide, as it is mentioned in Hashin (1962) and Weng (1984). In\nAppendix C, after some algebraic modi\u001ccations, it has been proved that Equations (5.63) are\nequal to Equation (5.42a) and (5.43a).\n\nFigure 5.8: Representation of the\nand the\n\nMori-Tanaka model and comparison with the Hill-Hashin\n\nHashin and Shtrikman bounds.

Therefore, in Peng et al. (2009) a new method\nthat combines both was formulated to better evaluate the e\u001bective properties of a composite\nmaterial.\nConsider an RVE with a matrix material and particle inclusions with volume fraction Ï†c ,\nwhere the inclusions are considered as spheres with the same size and are randomly distributed.\nIn the next step, these inclusions are separated into two groups:\n\nÂˆ Group I - Contains particle inclusions with a volume fraction of\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1âˆ’\nÏ†c over the\nn\n\nRVE;\n\nÂˆ Group II - Contains particle inclusions with a volume fraction of\n\nc\nover the RVE,\nn\n\nwhere n â‰¥ 1. The combined approach states that the particle inclusions in Group I have already\nbeen embedded in the original matrix to form a \u001cctitious matrix and that the elastic properties\nof this one are obtained with the\n\nSelf-Consistent scheme. Later, the particles of the Group II are\n\nfurther distributed in this \u001cctitious matrix to create the composite material, and the e\u001bective\n\nMori-Tanaka scheme. The number of\ninclusions in Group II should be large enough to meet the requirements of the Mori-Tanaka\nelastic properties of this later one are obtained with the\n\nmethod. As it was demonstrated in Peng et al. (2009), Figure 5.9 illustrates the whole process\nin a visual way.\nIt can be noticed that if n = 1 this combined method is equal to the\nand that if n â†’ âˆž the combined method refers to the\n\nMori-Tanaka estimate\n\nSelf-Consistent scheme (Figure 5.10b).\n\nBrie\u001dy, assuming that the volume of the RVE is VRV E , the volume of the original matrix is\ngiven by:\n\nVm = (1 âˆ’ Ï†c )VRV E ,\n\n(5.65)\n\nand the volume of particle inclusions in Group I is,\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013 \u0015\n1\nV cI =\n1âˆ’\nÏ†c VRV E ,\nn\n\n(5.66)\n\nthus, the volume of \u001cctitious matrix, VÌ‚m , and the equivalent volume fraction of the particle\n\n86\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\n(a) Particles in the original RVE are distributed into Group I and II.\n\n(b) Fictitious matrix formed by the original matrix and the particles of Group I.\n\n(c) Composite material formed by the \u001cctitious matrix and the particles of Group II.\nFigure 5.9: Schematic view of the combined self-consistent and Mori-Tanaka approach.\n\ninclusions in the \u001cctitious matrix, Ï†Ì‚c , are denoted as:\n\n\u0013 \u0015\n\u0014\u0012\n1\nVÌ‚m = Vm + 1 âˆ’\nÏ†c VRV E ,\nn\nÏ†Ì‚c =\n\nnâˆ’1\nÏ†c .\nn âˆ’ Ï†c\n\nThe elasticity tensor of the \u001cctitious matrix,\n\n(5.67a)\n\n(5.67b)\n\nLÌ‚m , is then determined with the Expression\n\n(5.53b) if Ï†c is replaced by Ï†Ì‚c , and this matrix is the one that it is used in the\n\nMori-Tanaka\n\nmodel.\nAssuming, again, isotropic spherical particle inclusions and isotropic elastic \u001cctitious matrix,\n\nChapter 5.\n\nMethods for the Determination of Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\n87\n\none can write explicit expressions for the bulk and shear moduli,\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nï£1\nÏ†c K c\nâˆ’1\nï£ ̄\nï£o\nn KÌ‚m\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013ï£o\nK âˆ— = KÌ‚m ï£ ̄\nï£°1 +\nï£»,\nÏ†c\nKc\n1+Î± 1âˆ’\nâˆ’1\nn\nKÌ‚m\n\n(5.68a)\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nï£1\nÏ† c Gc\nâˆ’1\nï£ ̄\nï£o\nn GÌ‚m\nï£o,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nGâˆ— = GÌ‚m ï£ ̄\n1\n+\nï£°\nï£»\nÏ†c\nGc\n1+Î2 1âˆ’\nâˆ’1\nn\nGÌ‚m\n\n(5.68b)\n\nï£®\n\nï£®\n\nwhere the e\u001bective elastic properties of the \u001cctitious matrix are de\u001cned by the\n\nSelf-Consistent\n\nmethod,\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nKc\nÏ†Ì‚c 1 âˆ’\n1\n1\nKm\n,\n=\n+\n1\n+\nÎ1⁄2Ì‚\nK\nm\nm\nKÌ‚m\nKÌ‚m +\n(Kc âˆ’ KÌ‚m )\n3(1 âˆ’ Î1⁄2Ì‚m )\n\n(5.69a)\n\n\u0013\nGc\nÏ†Ì‚c 1 âˆ’\n1\n1\nGm\n,\n=\n+\n2(4\nâˆ’\n5Î1⁄2Ì‚\nGm\nm)\nGÌ‚m\nGÌ‚m +\n(Gc âˆ’ GÌ‚m )\n15(1 âˆ’ Î1⁄2Ì‚m )\n\n(5.69b)\n\n\u0012\n\nand,\n\nÎ2=\n\n2(4 âˆ’ 5Î1⁄2Ì‚m )\n,\n15(1 âˆ’ Î1⁄2Ì‚m )\n\n(5.70a)\n\nÎ±=\n\n1 + Î1⁄2Ì‚m\n,\n3(1 âˆ’ Î1⁄2Ì‚m )\n\n(5.70b)\n\nÎ1⁄2Ì‚m =\n\n3KÌ‚m âˆ’ 2GÌ‚m\n6KÌ‚m + 2GÌ‚m\n\n.\n\n(5.70c)\n\nwhere Î1⁄2Ì‚m is the Poisson's ratio of the \u001cctitious matrix.\nIn Figure 5.10a the representation of the combined method is displayed and it can be noticed\nthat the parameter n has a major role in the results (Figure 5.10b).

With\nthis, one can perform a\n\nFinite Element Analysis to obtain the e\u001bective elastic properties of the\n\nmaterial. Imposing the deformation gradient and the boundary conditions, the program used\n(MSP) solves the micro-scale problem under the hypothesis of large deformations. As a result,\nthe incremental deformation gradient and the homogenized \u001crst Piola-Kirchho\u001b are obtained\nfor each increment.\nAs mentioned in Section 2.6.3, the time domain of the problem is discretized to be able to\nsolve problems that are dependent of the deformation history. The main objective of this work\nis to \u001cnd the e\u001bective elastic properties of the composite material that are representative of the\nelastic domain and, as shown in the Figure 5.11. Usually in this domain, the stress is a linear\nfunction of the strain. Therefore, theoretically, any force increment that stresses the material\ninside this domain should give the same e\u001bective elastic properties (shown in Section 5.4), and\nso, in order to get the results in a faster way, the values obtained in the \u001crst increment are the\nones that will be used.\n\n5.3.1 Phase Material Properties\nThe materials contained in the RVE are considered to be are isotropic and de\u001cned through\nthe Young's modulus and the Poisson's ratio. During the digital image analysis, a material is\nattributed to each pixel. Then, the skeleton of the \u001cnite element mesh is created and, in order\n\nChapter 5.\n\nMethods for the Determination of Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\n89\n\nFigure 5.11: Stress - strain curve - Representation of the elastic domain.\n\n1\n\nto increase the homogeneity of each element, several algorithms are applied to it . When the\nnal result is obtained, the skeleton gives rise to the \u001cnite element mesh where each element\nhas a material and a type of element assigned to it.\nFor each combination of element type and material, a new group is created. Therefore, an\nelement is characterized by three things: its identi\u001ccation number, the group number (that\nhas the information about the material and element type) and the identi\u001ccation number of the\nnodes that de\u001cne it. Each identi\u001ccation node is related with its Cartesian coordinates. This\ndata is required by MSP to run the analysis.\n\n5.3.2 Determination of the Homogenized Elastic Properties\nTo determine the elastic properties of the composite material, the homogenized stress tensor\nand strain tensor are used.\n\nThese are obtained through the MSP program that solves the\n\nmicroscale problem, but since the stress tensor obtained is the \u001crst Piola-Kirchho\u001b, this must\nbe converted to the Cauchy stress tensor through the following equation:\n\nÏƒ=\n\n1\nPFT.\nJ\n\n(5.71)\n\nwhere J = detF .\nIn the case of a RVE in 3 dimensions, and for the case of an overall orthotropic composite\nmaterial, as mentioned in the Section 5.1.1, the constitutive relation is given by the following\n\n1\n\nMentioned in Chapter 4.\n\n90\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nexpression,\n\nï£± ï£1⁄4 ï£®\nï£1ï£± ï£1⁄4\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nÏƒ\nC\nC\nC\n0\n0\n0\nÎμ11 ï£ ́\n11\n11\n12\n13\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£o\nï£ ̄\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£o\nï£ ̄\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nÏƒ\nC\nC\nC\n0\n0\n0\nÎμ\n22\n12\n22\n23\n22\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£o\nï£ ̄\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£2Ïƒ ï£1⁄2 ï£ ̄ C\nï£o\nï£2\n0\n0 ï£o Îμ33 ï£1⁄2\n33\nï£ ̄ 13 C23 C33 0\n=ï£ ̄\n,\nï£o\nï£ ́Ïƒ23 ï£ ́\nï£ ́ ï£ ̄ 0\nï£ ́\n0\n0 C44 0\n0 ï£o\nÎ323 ï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£o\nï£ ̄\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́ ï£ ̄\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́Î3 ï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nÏƒ13 ï£ ́\n0\n0\n0 C55 0 ï£o\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\n13 ï£ ́\nï£»ï£ ́\nï£° 0\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£3Ïƒ ï£3⁄4\nï£3Î3 ï£ ́\nï£3⁄4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nC\n12\n66\n12\nwhere Î323 = 2Îμ23 ,\n\n(5.72)\n\nÎ313 = 2Îμ13 , Î312 = 2Îμ12 .\n\nAs it can be seen, there are 9 coe\u001ecients to determine. To solve this, one should apply a\ndeformation gradient that strains the RVE in particular ways. If only one component of the\nstrain tensor, Îμ, is non-zero, the correspondent column of the sti\u001bness matrix is obtained. As\nan example, if Îμ11 6= 0 and all the other components are null, the following is true:\n\nÏƒii = C1i Îμ11,\n\ni = 1, 2, 3.\n\n(5.73)\n\nOnce all the elastic coe\u001ecients are acquired, the elastic properties can be calculated through\nExpressions (5.14) and (5.16).\nThe overall composite material can be isotropic or transversely isotropic but, before the\nanalysis is done, the material is considered as orthotropic to be able to consider the most\ngeneral case and, if the elastic constants are equal, the particular cases of symmetry can be\nidenti\u001ced.\nThis methodology can be used, not only to determine the elastic constants of a material\nwith all kind of inclusions, but also for materials that can contain voids in the microstructure.\n\n2D Plane Strain\nRewriting Expression (5.21), for the case of a two dimensional plane strain problem, the constitutive relation is given by:\n\nï£± ï£1⁄4\nï£ ́\nÏƒ11 ï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£2Ïƒ ï£ ́\nï£1⁄2\n\nï£®\n\nC11 C12 C13\n\nï£ ̄\nï£ ̄ C12 C22 C23\n=ï£ ̄\nï£ ̄ C\nï£ ́\nÏƒ33 ï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£° 13 C23 C33\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£3Ïƒ ï£3⁄4\n0\n0\n0\n12\n22\n\nï£1ï£± ï£1⁄4\nï£ ́\nï£ ́Îμ11 ï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£oï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£2\nï£1⁄2\nÎμ\n0 ï£o\n22\nï£o\n,\nï£ ́ 0 ï£ ́\nï£ ́\n0 ï£o\nï£»ï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́\nï£ ́ ï£ ́\nC44 ï£3Î312 ï£3⁄4\n0\n\n(5.74)\n\nand the same methodology used in the 3D case is applied. It is important to note that it is\nnot possible to obtain the third column of the sti\u001bness matrix and so the coe\u001ecient C33 is\nnot achievable. The coe\u001ecients C13 and C23 are obtained through the \u001crst and second column\nsteps.\nThe elastic constants are given by Expressions (5.14) and (5.16) but, without the value of\n\nC33 , Î ̃ cannot be calculated and, consequently, the elastic constants cannot be obtained. In\norder to solve this problem, the homogenized axial Young's modulus is calculated by the\n\nVoigt\n\nChapter 5.\n\nMethods for the Determination of Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\n91\n\nmodel,\n\nE3âˆ— = Ï†f Ef + (1 âˆ’ Ï†f )Em ,\n\n(5.75)\n\nwhere Ï†f is the \u001cber volume fraction and Em and Ef are the matrix and \u001cber Young's modulus,\nrespectively. After this, Î ̃ and, consequently, C33 can be determined.\n\nDeformation Gradient\nTo be able to determine each column of the sti\u001bness matrix at a certain time, di\u001berent types\nof strains must be enforced to the RVE, ensuring that only one component of the strain tensor,\n\nÎμ, is di\u001berent from zero. Although the MSP program has for input the deformation gradient,\nF , it is possible to connect both tensors. The procedure hereafter presented is based on the\nprocedure used in Carvalho et al. (2015)\nIn order to relate both concepts, one must \u001cnd the deformation gradient that applies a\nsingle direction longitudinal or a shear stretch on the RVE. To ensure an easy convergence of\nthe\n\nNewton-Raphson method, the number of increments chosen will be around 10000, and, since\n\nthe increment of interest is the \u001crst, one can consider the strain of the RVE as a in\u001cnitesimal\nstrain, thus it is possible to assume that the\n\nHencky tensor, E , can be approximated by the\n\nin\u001cnitesimal strain tensor Îμ,\n\nE=Îμâ‰¡\n\ni\n1h\nâˆ‡X u + (âˆ‡X u)T .\n2\n\n(5.76)\n\nand, on the other hand,\n\nE = ln[U ] â‰¡ ln\n\nF T F = 21 ln F T F .\ni\n\nhp\n\n(5.77)\n\nwhere ln[Â·] denotes the tensor logarithm of [Â·]. With this expression, it is possible to relate both\nthe strain tensor and the deformation tensor. Due to the characteristics of this relation, the\nspectral decomposition of the\n\nHencky tensor 2 has to be taken into consideration,\n\nE=\n\n3\nX\n\nl\n\nl\n\nE\nE\nÎ»E\ni i âŠ— i ,\n\n(5.78)\n\ni=1\n\nl\n\nE are the eigenvalues and E are the eigenvectors of E .

As mentioned in\nSection 3.1, the size of the RVE is an important factor to take into account. It needs to be large\n\n3\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction of Section 5.3.\n\n96\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nenough to be statistically representative of the material's microstructure and small enough to\nbe easily analysed on a computational level. Figure 5.12 is clearly not big enough to correctly\nrepresent the microstruscture of the plasma-etched Si3 Na4 , since it only contains a low number\nof its singularities. To solve this problem, in Chapter 6, the study of the RVE size is presented.\n\n5.5 Conclusions\nThe majority of the engineering structures are designed to withstand loads that do not stress the\nmaterial outside the elastic domain and, due to the signi\u001ccant demand that composite materials\nhave nowadays, it is important to be able to estimate the macroscopic elastic properties of\nmaterials, even when their microstructure is too complex.\nDespite the existence of analytical methods that, resorting to the Eshelby tensor (S), take\ninto consideration the microstructure geometry, their limitations are exposed when the inclusions diverge from simple spherical or ellipsoidal shapes.\n\nFor those cases, the Digital Image\n\nBased microstructure recognition technique presents a new method that, for any given microstructure, is able to correctly model the behaviour of a material at the microscopic level,\nhence, producing more accurate results than those obtained by the mathematical expressions\ngiven by analytical methods.\nThe procedure to estimate the elastic properties has been presented in this chapter and a\nsimple validation of the code is performed. The use of the \u001crst load increment to obtain the\ne\u001bective elastic constants is also justi\u001ced.\n\nIt is then important to perform some parametric\n\nstudies to improve each step of the process and to be certain that the obtained results are\ncorrect.\nIn the next chapter, these parametric studies are presented, such as the optimal RVE size\nand the \u001cnite element size that correctly model its behaviour.\n\nChapter 6\nParametric Studies on the Homogenized\nElastic Properties\n\nDue to high costs associated with the experimental procedures and given the fact that analytical\nmethods are not su\u001eciently accurate to predict the homogenized elastic properties in complex\nconditions, the method presented in Chapters 4 and 5 o\u001bers a new and more accurate solution\nto obtain the homogenized properties, enabling the problem to be solved on a computational\nlevel while taking into account complex microstructure geometries.\nIn the case of a 3D RVE, the full sti\u001bness tensor may be obtained through this procedure\nwhile, in the case of a 2D RVE, the out-of-plane Young's modulus must set\n\na priori, due to\n\nthe lower number of equations compared with the amount of unknown elasticity constants.\nHowever, in order to validate the results achieved by this method, the whole process used to\ngenerate the \u001cnite element mesh has to be analysed step by step.\nFirst of all, parametric studies are made to de\u001cne whether the obtained results are valid or\nnot. This include a study on the RVE size to \u001cnd the optimized value that correctly represents\nthe microstructure and a study on the mesh size also needs to be performed, due to the use of\nthe\n\nFinite Element Method. During this process, it is noteworthy to mention the in\u001duence of\n\nthe image quality of the representative micrograph on the estimated e\u001bective elastic properties.\nLater, a comparison note between the results obtained and the analytical methods described in\nSection 5.2 is presented, more precisely with the\n\nMori-Tanaka method and with the Hashin-Hill\n\nboundaries. The in\u001duence of the sti\u001bness ratio between the \u001cber and matrix materials on the\nRVE size, is also analysed.\nWith these studies completed, the optimal RVE and correspondent mesh size are de\u001cned\nand the in\u001duence of the sti\u001bness ratio on the homogenized elastic properties is determined in\nthe case of a unidirectional \u001cber composite.\n97\n\n98\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\n6.1 Studies to Determine the RVE Size\nAs mentioned in Chapter 3 and in Section 5.4, the size of the RVE that aims to model the\nmicrostructure of a material is an important factor when estimating its homogenized elastic\nproperties.\nIn this section, the main objective is to \u001cnd the minimum RVE size that is statistically\nrepresentative of the microstructure. To study the in\u001duence of this parameter, a micrograph\n(Figure 6.1) of a metal matrix composite, whose matrix and \u001cbers are respectively NiAl2 and\nCr, is analysed for di\u001berent sizes of the RVE.\n\nFigure 6.1: Micrograph of a composite material (NiAl2 -Cr) with di\u001berent sizes of RVEs displayed\n(Terada et al., 2000): (a) 1024 Ã— 1024 px; (b) 896 Ã— 896 px; (c) 768 Ã— 768 px; (d) 640 Ã— 640 px;\n(e) 512 Ã— 512 px; (f ) 384 Ã— 384 px; (g) 256 Ã— 256 px; (h) 128 Ã— 128 px. The smallest RVE in\nthe middle with only one \u001cber has 32 Ã— 32 px.\n\n6.1.1 Image Treatment\nFigure 6.1 does not contain enough quality or resolution, therefore, \u001crstly an image treatment\nis necessary to improve the quality of the micrograph to later permit faster and better results\nwith the image segmentation step.\nUsing Adobe Photoshop\n\nÂ®\n\n, the white square lines that subdivide the whole micrograph in\n\ndi\u001berent RVEs are removed, the matrix part (lighter color) is coloured with white and the \u001cbers\nare painted with black. After this color manipulation, it is easier to select the di\u001berent pixel\ngroups that belong to the matrix and \u001cber parts.\n\nChapter 6.\n\nParametric Studies on the Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\n99\n\nFigure 6.2: Image manipulation of Figure 6.1 to better de\u001cne the material boundaries.\n\nConsidering the sub-divisions displayed in Figure 6.1, this newly treated micrograph illustrated in Figure 6.2 is divided into 8 RVEs of di\u001berent sizes, presented in Figure 6.3. These\nRVEs are characterized by their pixel dimensions but, attributing a physical dimension to them,\nfacilitates the process of automatically creating the \u001crst version of the skeleton using the automated script\n\n1 of OOF2. In a \u001crst order Multi-Scale model, the precise size of the RVE is not\n\nimportant, only the relative size between the constituents and the RVE matter. Therefore, the\nconversion from pixel to physical dimensions is presented in Table 6.1. The value of 10 Ã— 10 is\nrandom, but not too small to keep the xâˆ’ and yâˆ’coordinates admissible, avoiding the numerical\nerrors which arises from extremely small numbers. The other dimensions correctly characterize\nthe scale between RVEs.\nTable 6.1: Conversion from pixel to physical dimensions.\n\nPixel\nPhysical\nPixel\nPhysical\n\n128 Ã— 128\n\n256 Ã— 256\n\n384 Ã— 384\n\n512 Ã— 512\n\n10 Ã— 10\n\n20 Ã— 20\n\n30 Ã— 30\n\n40 Ã— 40\n\n640 Ã— 640\n\n768 Ã— 768\n\n896 Ã— 896\n\n1024 Ã— 1024\n\n50 Ã— 50\n\n60 Ã— 60\n\n70 Ã— 70\n\n80 Ã— 80\n\nConsidering the smallest RVE (Figure 6.3a), the procedure to create the \u001cnite element mesh\nis further described.

Hence, before presenting the results about the RVE\nsize, a study to de\u001cne the correct mesh size must be performed. During this analysis, only the\n\nMortar Periodic boundary condition is utilized.\nIn the \u001crst place, the initial versions of the skeletons are created by the automated script of\nOOF2, therefore the following parameters\n\n2 must be de\u001cned for each case: maxscale, minscale\n\nhomogeneity threshold. Later, each skeleton is improved utilizing the Rationalize, Swap\nEdges, Split Quads, Merge Triangles, Smooth and/or Anneal routines. There is not a correct\nand\n\nway to create the perfect skeleton, meaning that these functions should be chosen according\nwith the user's criteria of a well designed skeleton (\u001cnite element mesh) that correctly resembles\nthe microstructure's geometry.\nTable 6.3 presents the di\u001berent parameters chosen to create the four di\u001berent mesh versions,\nalong with the \u001cnal informations. The \u001cnal versions are displayed in Figure 6.5.\nTable 6.3: Parameters chosen to automatically create the initial skeleton version for each mesh\nof the 10 Ã— 10 RVE and respective information.

The parameters used to automatically create the skeleton\nand the respective informations are presented in Table 6.5. Excluding the Poisson's ratio, the\nresults are given in Table 6.6. It can be noticed that, regarding the 20 Ã— 20 and the 30 Ã— 30\nRVEs, the di\u001berence from version 1 and 2 (more re\u001cned) is lower than 0.5%, thus, version 1\nis the selected one for these cases. As the size of the RVE increases, the relative importance\nof each \u001cber decreases, hence, a more coarse mesh may be used to estimate the homogenized\nelastic properties. Summarizing,\n\nmaxscale = minscale = 0.2,\nmaxscale = minscale = 0.3,\nwhere the\n\nfor the 10 Ã— 10 RVE,\nfor RVEs equal and larger than 20 Ã— 20.\n\nhomogeneity threshold is equal to 0.9 in every case.\n\nBefore presenting the results about the RVE size, an analysis on the image quality of the\nRVE taken from Terada et al.

As it can be seen, the\njagged boundaries of the materials do not correctly represent the real microstructure. Therefore,\nthe skeleton, while trying to reduce the\n\nshape and homogeneity energy 3 , attempts to mold to\n\nthe low quality boundaries illustrated in this image and the \u001cnal results may be inaccurate.\n\nFigure 6.6: Zoom of the 80 Ã— 80 RVE to illustrate the quality of the mesh.\n\nÂ®\n\nTo solve this problem, the image displayed in Figure 6.2 is vectorized using Adobe Illustrator\ni.e. using the function\n\nImage Trace, the bitmap image undergoes a raster-to-vector conversion\n\n(or vectorization). In a vector image, the edges are represented as a mathematical lines or curves\nand, unlike the raster image, it can be magni\u001ced, theoretically, thousands of times without losing de\u001cnition.\n\nAfter the image tracing procedure, same parts are not correctly represented\n\nand manual corrections are needed, specially when two \u001cbers are connected as illustrated in\nFigure 6.7.\nNevertheless, after the image tracing procedure has been completed, the image has to be\nexported from Adobe Illustrator\n\nÂ®\n\nas a bitmap \u001cle again (e.g. .png \u001cle extension). The image\n\nis exported with a high resolution of 300 PPI (pixels per inch). In Figure 6.8, the di\u001berence\nbetween the initial and the \u001cnal 80 Ã— 80 RVE is presented. As it can be seen in Figure 6.8d,\nthe jagged boundaries of Figure 6.8c have nearly vanished. The initial image had a dimension\nof 1024 Ã— 1024 pixels and the new one has 4267 Ã— 4267 pixels, which means around 17 times\nmore resolution.\n\n3\n\nAddressed in Section 4.2.3.\n\n,\n\nChapter 6.\n\nParametric Studies on the Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\n(a) Before the image tracing.\n\n(b) After the image tracing.\n\n105\n\n(c) After the manual correction.\n\nFigure 6.7: Example of the two steps needed to complete the image tracing procedure.\n\n(a) Initial RVE (Figure 6.2).\n\n(b) New RVE.\n\n(c) Zoom of Figure 6.8a.\n\n(d) Zoom of Figure 6.8b.\n\nFigure 6.8: Di\u001berence between the initial image (lower quality) and the new one (higher quality)\nfor the 80 Ã— 80 RVE.\n\nRepetition of the Mesh Size Study\nWith the change in the image quality, the study about the mesh size has to be remade.

Furthermore, it is noteworthy to mention\nthat the\n\nhomogeneity is higher in these meshes than it was in the meshes generated trough the\n\ninitial image (Table 6.4). This can be explained by the higher resolution image that enables\nbetter results in the segmentation process, as illustrated in Figure 6.9.\nThe homogenized elastic properties for these \u001cve versions are presented in Table 6.8. Based\non the same criterion as before, the selected version is the number 3 because the relative\ndi\u001berences from this version to the next one (version 4) are lower than 0.5%.\nThe same study is repeated for larger RVEs (20 Ã— 20, 30 Ã— 30 and 60 Ã— 60).

Comparing Figure 6.10a with Figure 6.10b,\none can notice that the improved results obtained during the image segmentation process (Figure 6.9) re\u001dect on a skeleton that better characterizes the microstructure of the material, hence,\nproducing more accurate results.\n\n(a) Zoom of the initial mesh 3.\n\n(b) Zoom the new mesh 3.\n\n(c) Zoom of the new mesh 4.\n\nFigure 6.10: Comparison between the initial and new \u001cnite element meshes of the 10 Ã— 10 RVE.\n\nFurthermore, taking into account the results presented in this section, and considering a\nRVE of a unidirectional \u001cber composite, it is possible to de\u001cne that a value within one third\n\nChapter 6.\n\nParametric Studies on the Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\n109\n\nand one fourth of the \u001cber radius is a good element's size and so:\n\n1\n1\nradius\u001cber â‰¤ minscale â‰¤\nradius\u001cber ,\n4\n3\nwhile the\n\n(6.1)\n\nmaxscale parameter should have an approximate value in order to favor the formation\n\nof quadrilateral elements.\n\n6.1.4 Results\nWith the mesh size de\u001cned for all RVEs, the steps needed to estimate the e\u001bective elastic properties are performed. In this section, the results are presented for the initial RVE (Figure 6.2)\nand for the new RVE (Figure 6.8b), obtained after the image tracing process. Later, a note on\nboth results is made, along with a comparison with the estimated properties obtained with the\n\nMori-Tanaka method and with the Hashin-Hill bounds.\nFinally, a study on the in\u001duence of di\u001berent sti\u001bness ratios (sti\u001bness of the \u001cber material\nover the sti\u001bness of the matrix material) is made to analyse if the RVE size is dependent on\nthis factor.\nTo enable an easier interpretation of the results, the RVE size is described by a characteristic\nlength, which is the RVE dimensions normalized by the smallest RVE that only contains one\nber (presented in Figure 6.1). In Terada et al. (2000), this model has 32 Ã— 32 pixels, thus, the\ncharacteristic lengths are de\u001cned in Table 6.11.\nTable 6.11: Conversion from pixel dimensions to characteristic length.\n\nPixel Dimensions\nPhysical Dimensions\nCharacteristic Length\nPixel Dimensions\nPhysical Dimensions\nCharacteristic Length\n\n128 Ã— 128\n\n256 Ã— 256\n\n384 Ã— 384\n\n512 Ã— 512\n\n10 Ã— 10\n\n20 Ã— 20\n\n30 Ã— 30\n\n40 Ã— 40\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n640 Ã— 640\n\n768 Ã— 768\n\n896 Ã— 896\n\n1024 Ã— 1024\n\n50 Ã— 50\n\n60 Ã— 60\n\n70 Ã— 70\n\n80 Ã— 80\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\nInitial RVE\nIn order to achieve these results, the procedure described in Figure 1.1 was followed, excluding\nthe \u001crst block \"Acquisition of a Micrograph\", which was obtained from Terada et al. (2000), as\ndescribed earlier in this section.\nFurthermore, the \u001cnite element analyses are computed taking into consideration the three\n\nLinear, Mortar Periodic and Uniform Traction\n\nmain constraints addressed in Section 3.4 (\nboundary conditions).\n\n110\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nWith the material properties de\u001cned in Table 6.2, the homogenized sti\u001bness tensor is computed for each RVE and the 2-norm of these tensors are presented in Figure 6.11.\n\nFigure 6.11: Representation of the 2-norm of the homogenized sti\u001bness tensor,\n\nCâˆ— , of the initial\n\nRVEs.\n\nLooking at these results, it can be seen that the\n\nLinear and Uniform Traction boundary\n\nconditions set the upper and lower boundaries for the homogenized elastic properties, as mentioned in Section 3.4.5. Moreover and as it is expected, the di\u001berent boundary conditions are\nconverging for the same value and the\n\nMortar Periodic boundary condition seems to converge\n\nfaster for the optimal result.\n\nâˆ—\n\nâˆ—\n\nIn Figure 6.12, the homogenized in-plane Young's moduli, E1 and E2 , are illustrated for\nthe three boundary conditions aforementioned. The same conclusions taken for Figure 6.11 can\nbe applied and one can notice that both moduli tend to converge for the same value, meaning\n\n4\n\nthat the composite material may be characterized as transversely isotropic . This is explained\nby the randomness distribution of the \u001cbers that tend to in\u001duence both plane directions on the\nsame way, as the RVE increases in size.\nTable 6.12: Mesh information of the initial 10 Ã— 10, 40 Ã— 40 and 80 Ã— 80 RVEs.\n\nRVE\n\n4\n\nAddressed in Section 5.1.2.\n\nElements Nodes\n\n10 Ã— 10\n\n2909\n\n2720\n\n40 Ã— 40\n\n22001\n\n19311\n\n80 Ã— 80\n\n91846\n\n77913\n\nChapter 6.\n\nParametric Studies on the Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\n111\n\nâˆ—\n\nâˆ—\n\nFigure 6.12: Representation of the homogenized in-plane Young's moduli, E1 and E2 , of the\ninitial RVEs.\n\nIn both Figure 6.11 and 6.12, it can be seen that the values of the\n\nMortar Periodic boundary\n\ncondition start to converge for a characteristic length of 16, meaning that the middle RVE\n(512 Ã— 512 px or 40 Ã— 40 in physical dimensions) may be considered large enough to correctly\nrepresent the microstructure of this material.\nThe mesh information relative to this RVE is presented in Table 6.12, along with the information regarding the 10Ã—10 and 80Ã—80 RVEs. The number of elements and nodes necessary to\nmodel this microstructure is nearly 25% than those needed to model the largest RVE, meaning\nthat the computational power needed to run the analyses is much lower.\n\nFor instance, con-\n\nsidering the computer used to run the majority of the simulations, in the case of the 40 Ã— 40\nRVE, it takes around 5 seconds to complete the analysis of one load increment for a single\n\nMortar Periodic ) and, for the 80 Ã— 80 RVE, it\n\ndeformation gradient and boundary condition (\n\ntakes ten times more to complete the same process (â‰ˆ 50 seconds). The generation of the \u001cnite\nelement mesh is also quicker in the 40 Ã— 40 RVE, since it not only depends on the amount of\nnodes and elements that are processed during the OOF2 routines but also on the amount of\npixels of the micrograph.\n\nNew RVE\nTaking into consideration the new RVE generated after the image tracing process (Figure 6.8b),\nthe procedure to obtain the homogenized properties is equal to the one followed in the initial\nRVE. Therefore, Figure 6.13 illustrates the variation of the 2-norm of the homogenized sti\u001bness\ntensor.\n\n112\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nFigure 6.13: Representation of the 2-norm of the homogenized sti\u001bness tensor,\n\nCâˆ— , of the new\n\nRVEs.\n\nAnalysing the results, the same conclusions regarding the upper and lower boundaries can\n\nLinear and Uniform Traction boundary conditions represent the upper and\nlower boundaries of the homogenized elastic properties. One can also conclude that the Mortar\nPeriodic boundary condition converges faster to the theoretical value, thus, being the favoured\nbe made, i.e. the\n\nboundary condition when estimating the homogenized elastic properties of a composite material.\nIt is known that the phases' volume fraction is one of the most important factors concerning\ncomposite materials, and, while running the analyses for this studies, it has been noticed that\nthe \u001cber volume fraction drives the results regarding the other e\u001bective properties. Moreover, to\nbe able to compute the di\u001berent sti\u001bness tensor coe\u001ecients, the e\u001bective axial Young's modulus,\n\nE3âˆ— , is previous settled by the Voigt model5 (rule of mixtures ), thus, E3âˆ— depends linearly on the\nber volume fraction, Ï†f , as demonstrated in Figure 6.14.\nIn Figure 6.15, the variations of the e\u001bective in-plane Young's moduli are presented and\n\nâˆ—\n\nâˆ—\n\nagain, E1 and E2 , converge to the same value (transversely isotropic material). Moreover, the\n\nâˆ—\n\nhomogenized plane shear modulus, G12 , presents the same type of dependence on the RVE size,\nand the upper and lower boundaries remain the same (Figure 6.16).\nFurthermore, it is noteworthy to mention that the upper and lower boundaries invert when\n\nâˆ—\n\nanalysing the homogenized plane Poisson's ratio, Î1⁄212 . This is illustrated in Figure 6.17, and to\nexplain this phenomenon, it is important to remember that the Poisson's ratio re\u001dects the capacity of the material to expand/contract in a speci\u001cc orientation when loaded on a perpendicular\ndirection.\n\nTherefore, the\n\nUniform Traction boundary condition, being the less restrictive of\n\nthe microscopic constraints here applied, tends to give more \u001dexibility to the material during\n\n5\n\nAs expressed in Equation (5.75).\n\nChapter 6.\n\nParametric Studies on the Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\n113\n\nâˆ—\n\nFigure 6.14: Representation of the homogenized axial Young's modulus, E3 , and \u001cber volume\nfraction, Ï†f , of the new RVEs.\n\nâˆ—\n\nâˆ—\n\nFigure 6.15: Representation of the homogenized in-plane Young's moduli, E1 and E2 , of the\nnew RVEs.\n\nthe deformation process, resulting on a higher Poisson's ratio. Contrariwise, the\n\nLinear bound-\n\nary condition, as the most restrictive one, partly prevents the deformation, producing a lower\nPoisson's ratio.\nFinally, with all these results, the 40 Ã— 40 RVE may be considered as the optimal RVE size\nto estimate the overall properties, as mentioned during the analyses of the initial RVEs.\n\n114\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nâˆ—\n\nFigure 6.16: Representation of the homogenized plane shear modulus, G12 , of the new RVEs.\n\nâˆ—\n\nFigure 6.17: Representation of the homogenized Poisson's ratio, Î1⁄212 , of the new RVEs.\n\nComparison between RVEs\nWith these di\u001berent studies completed, the in\u001duence of the image processing that converted\nthe initial RVEs into the new ones can be analysed.\nAs mentioned before and represented in Figure 6.15, 6.16 and 6.17, the homogenized elastic properties are highly dependent on the \u001cber volume fraction (Figure 6.14). This value is\nobtained using the MATLAB\n\nÂ®\n\nscript that reads the output \u001cle of OOF2 and writes the input\n\nChapter 6.\n\nParametric Studies on the Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\n115\n\nle for MSP. It computes the volume fraction for each constituent from the sum of the \u001cnite\nelements' area assigned to them. Therefore, the \u001cber volume fractions of the initial and new\nRVEs are presented in Figure 6.18, and a stabilized di\u001berence of 1% for RVEs larger than 30Ã—30\n(characteristic length = 12) is noticed. This change in volume fraction is explained by the fact\nthat, after the image tracing process the \u001cbers are better de\u001cned (Figure 6.8) and during the\nsegmentation process more pixels are selected generating a smoother shape (Figure 6.9).\n\nâˆ—\n\nIn Table 6.13, the results for E1 are presented along with the respective relative di\u001berences,\n\nâˆ†, obtained by the following expression:\nâˆ†=\n\n| E1âˆ—new âˆ’ E1âˆ—initial |\nÃ— 100 [%].\nE1âˆ—new\n\n(6.2)\n\nThe change of 1% in the \u001cber volume fraction results on âˆ† values between 1% and 2% on\nthe homogenized elastic properties. Neither one of the results can be considered correct since\nthe initial RVEs lack image de\u001cnition because they are taken directly from an article (Terada\net al., 2000), and the new RVEs are generated through an image modi\u001ccation process that\nmay introduce changes in the microstructure.\n\nNonetheless, these analyses aim to show the\n\nimportance of the image quality on the \u001cnal results and, since the new RVEs present a better\ncorrelation with the microstructure geometry, those are the ones that will be used on the studies\npresented hereafter.\n\nFigure 6.18: Representation of the \u001cber volume fraction, Ï†f , of the initial and new RVEs.\n\nComparison with the Analytical Methods\nAs mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, the analytical methods presented in Section 5.2,\nhave limitations when estimating the homogenized elastic properties of composite materials.

Being the volume\n\n118\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nfraction one of the most important factors and the variable that drives the homogenized properties, it is important to take this into consideration when trying to improve the image resolution\nof a micrograph. Even so, in this case, the image after the vectorization process better characterized the materials microstructure.\nIn addition, the homogenized elastic properties started to converge for dimensions greater\nthan the 40 Ã— 40 RVE. Thus, this can be de\u001cned as the optimal RVE size to predict the e\u001bective\nelastic properties of a microstructure of this type. The 40Ã—40 RVE is de\u001cned by a characteristic\nlength of 16, hence, one can conclude that, for a unidirectional \u001cber composite material, its\nmicrostructure can be modelled by a RVE 15-20 times larger than a single \u001cber (inclusion).\nThis leads to a shorter use of computational power than the necessary to analyse the 80 Ã— 80\nRVE.\nFurthermore, the numerical model with the\nanalytical\n\nMortar Periodic boundary constraint and the\n\nMori-Tanaka model seem to produce similar results regarding the homogenized plane\nâˆ—\n\nYoung's modulus, Ep , with a relative di\u001berence below 1%, validating the results obtained with\nthe numerical method.\n\nHowever, the numerical method is not limited to simple shapes, like\n\nspherical or ellipsoidal inclusions, and can model any given microstructure.\n\nIn addition, the\n\nvalues obtained with both methods are within the theoretical upper and lower boundaries of\n\nHashin -Hill and the numerical upper and lower limits produced by the Linear and Uniform\nTraction boundary conditions (Figure 6.19). Also, it is important to mention that the numerical\nâˆ—\n\nboundary conditions invert when referring to the e\u001bective plane Poisson's ratio, Î1⁄212 , due to the\nnature of this elastic constant (Figure 6.17).\n\n6.1.5 In\u001duence of the Sti\u001bness Ratio on the RVE Size\nWith the RVE size study completed for a sti\u001bness ratio of 10, other sti\u001bness ratios may be\nattributed to the constituents properties to test the impact of this parameter on the minimal\nsize of the RVE that statistically represents the microstructure.\nTo do so, the Young's modulus of the \u001cber material is changed while keeping the Young's\nmodulus of the matrix material constant and equal to 10 GPa. In Figure 6.20, the normalized\n\nÂ ̄âˆ— , given by:\ne\u001bective plane Young's modulus, E\np\nEÂ ̄pâˆ— =\n\nEpâˆ—\n,\nEm\n\n(6.4)\n\nis presented for di\u001berent sti\u001bness ratios. Focusing on the values of the middle RVEs, the relative\ndi\u001berences are presented in Table 6.15 for comparison and a small in\u001duence can be noticed since\nthis value increases. However, as shown in Figure 6.20, the 40 Ã— 40 RVE (characteristic length\n\n= 16) still correctly represents the microstructure since it is near the average value obtained\nwith larger RVEs.\nIn Figure 6.21, the estimated properties for the case where the sti\u001bness ratio is 100 are\n\nLinear boundary condition tends to depart from the values\ngiven by the Mortar Periodic and the Uniform Traction boundary conditions, meaning that\npresented, and it is noticed that the\n\nChapter 6.\n\nParametric Studies on the Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\n119\n\nÂ ̄âˆ— , for di\u001berent\nFigure 6.20: Representation of the normalized e\u001bective plane Young's modulus, E\np\nsti\u001bness ratios.\n\nthis constraint loses accuracy as the sti\u001bness ratio increases.\n\nEither so, the\n\nMortar Periodic\n\nconstraint continues to lie within the other two boundaries.\nFurthermore, even with the increasing di\u001berence in the \u001cber/matrix properties, the analyt-\n\nMori-Tanaka model remains a good approximation to the numerical values achieved with\nthe Mortar Periodic boundary condition, as illustrated in Figure 6.22. However, as seen in Figure 6.19, the Mori-Tanaka model gave results higher than those obtained with the numerical\n\nical\n\nmethod and, in this case, the estimated values are lower. This means that with an increase in\nthe sti\u001bness ratio, the\n\nMori-Tanaka model tends to underestimate the e\u001bective Young's mod-\n\nulus (as shown in Figure 6.20). Moreover, for the 60 Ã— 60 RVE, the analytical values are even\nbelow the lower boundary settled by the\n\nUniform Traction constraint.\n\nâˆ—\n\nTable 6.15: Comparison between the homogenized plane Young's modulus, Ep , for di\u001berent\nsti\u001bness ratios.\n\nSti\u001bness Ratio\n\n10\n\n25\n\n50\n\n100\n\nUnit\n\n30 Ã— 30\n\n18.156\n\n19.970\n\n20.746\n\n21.192\n\nGPa\n\n0.730\n\n0.903\n\n0.994\n\n1.042\n\n%\n\n18.024\n\n19.790\n\n20.540\n\n20.971\n\nGPa\n\n0.343\n\n0.534\n\n0.655\n\n0.762\n\n%\n\n17.962\n\n19.684\n\n20.405\n\n20.811\n\nGPa\n\n40 Ã— 40\n\n50 Ã— 50\n\n120\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nâˆ—\n\nFigure 6.21: Representation of the homogenized Young's modulus, E1 , for a sti\u001bness ratio of\n100.\n\nâˆ—\n\nFigure 6.22: Representation of the homogenized plane Young's modulus, Ep , obtained by the\nnumerical and the\n\nMori-Tanaka models.\n\nNote: In the MSP program, the standard criterion set to \u001cnish the\n\n6\nprocess is that the relative residual norm,\n\nNewton-Raphson iterative\n\nkrk\nâˆ’6 .

Therefore, the following studies are\nperformed using only this RVE.\nDi\u001berent sti\u001bness ratios were analysed, from 5 to 100 with a step of 5 and the results for\n\nâˆ—\n\nâˆ—\n\nâˆ—\n\nthe homogenized plane Young's modulus, Ep (average of the E1 and E2 moduli), are presented\nin Figure 6.20.\n\nFigure 6.23: In\u001duence of the sti\u001bness ratio on the normalized e\u001bective plane Young's modulus,\n\nEÂ ̄pâˆ— , obtained by the numerical and the Mori-Tanaka models.\n\nAs mentioned in Section 6.1.5 and illustrated in Figure 6.20, the impact of the \u001cber material\ntends to decrease as the sti\u001bness ratio increases. For lower ratios the in\u001duence of the \u001cber elastic\nproperties is accentuated but it starts to stabilize as the Young's modulus of the \u001cber material\n\n122\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nbecomes higher. For instance, for a ratio of 5, the e\u001bective plane Young's modulus is 1.6 times\nhigher than that of the matrix but, for a ratio of 100, it only is 2.1 times higher.\nAlso noteworthy to mention is the fact that the\n\nLinear boundary condition completely\n\ndiverges from the other results as the sti\u001bness ratio increases, showing a linear relation for\nratios higher than 30.\n\nâˆ—\n\nIn the case of the e\u001bective axial Young's modulus, E3 , with the assumption of the\n\nrule of\n\nmixtures, its value increases linearly with the sti\u001bness ratio, being this the main function of the\nber material in unidirectional \u001cber composites, designed to withstand high traction loads in\nthe axial direction.\n\nNote: All of these studies have been performed for Î1⁄2m = Î1⁄2f = 0.3, while changing one parameter\nat a time. In Table 6.16, the in\u001duence of the Poisson's ratio is demonstrated to indicate that\na change on its value may lead to di\u001berent results than those here obtained. Material 1 has\n\nÎ1⁄2m = Î1⁄2f = 0.3 while material 2 has Î1⁄2m = 0.4 and Î1⁄2f = 0.3. Both have a sti\u001bness ratio of 10\nand Em = 10 GPa.\nTable 6.16: Comparison between the homogenized elastic properties of two materials, while\nchanging the Poisson's ratio of the matrix.\n\nMaterial\n1\n2\nMaterial\n1\n2\n\nCâˆ—\n\nE1âˆ—\n\nE2âˆ—\n\nE3âˆ—\n\nGâˆ—12\n\n2-norm of\n\n17.991\n\n18.056\n\n41.563\n\n6.589\n\n54.792\n\nGPa\n\n4.020\n\n3.959\n\n0.000\n\n4.648\n\n13.051\n\n%\n\n17.268\n\n17.341\n\n41.563\n\n6.896\n\n47.641\n\nGPa\n\nâˆ—\nÎ1⁄212\n\nâˆ—\nÎ1⁄221\n\nâˆ—\nÎ1⁄213\n\nâˆ—\nÎ1⁄231\n\nâˆ—\nÎ1⁄223\n\nâˆ—\nÎ1⁄232\n\nUnit\n\n0.3471\n\n0.3484\n\n0.1299\n\n0.3000\n\n0.1303\n\n0.3000\n\n-\n\n30.913\n\n30.855\n\n21.247\n\n17.900\n\n21.028\n\n17.800\n\n%\n\n0.2398\n\n0.2409\n\n0.1023\n\n0.2463\n\n0.1029\n\n0.2466\n\n-\n\nUnit\n\nThe relative di\u001berences of the Young's and shear moduli are around 5% but, when considering the Poisson's ratio, these values increase as expected. Nonetheless, the overall qualitative\nconclusions attained when considering Î1⁄2m = Î1⁄2f are still valid.\n\n6.3 Homogenized Elastic Properties obtained with 3D RVEs\nSince all the analyses here presented are performed with the assumption of a two dimensional\nplane strain problem, which considers the 2D RVE as cross section of an equally extruded\nmicrostructure, it is important to \u001cnd for which axial (out-of-plane) length this assumption\nstarts to produce accurate results.\nTherefore, using the open-source program OOF3D, several \u001cnite element meshes were created in order to estimate the overall elastic properties, while increasing the axial dimension of\n\nChapter 6.\n\nParametric Studies on the Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\n123\n\nthe RVE. The main goal was to \u001cnd a relation between the length of the RVE and the respective cross section dimensions and to conclude that for higher values it was valid to replace the\nthree dimensional problem by a two dimensional plane strain analysis, aiming to reduce the\ncomplexity of the whole procedure.\nHowever, as mentioned in Section 4.4, the open-source program OOF3D revealed some\nerrors while creating the output \u001cle that contained the \u001cnite element mesh data. Therefore,\nthis program could not be used to generate meshes for 3D RVEs and a di\u001berent approach was\ncarried out.\nUsing the image of the 40 Ã— 40 RVE obtained after the image tracing process, and using\nthe Autodesk AutoCAD\n\nÂ®\n\nprogram, a \".dwg\" \u001cle was created with the information of the\n\nmicrostructure. Two \".dxf\" \u001cles were exported from AutoCAD\n\nÂ®\n\n, representing the matrix and\n\nber material, illustrated in Figure 6.24a and 6.24b, respectively.\n\n(a) 2D \u001cbers representation.\n\n(b) 2D matrix representation.\n\n(c) 3D \u001cbers part.\n\n(d) 3D matrix part.\n\nÂ®\n\nÂ®\n\nFigure 6.24: Representation of the 2D \u001cles exported by Autocad\n\nand the respective 3D parts\n\ngenerated by Abaqus\n\nÂ®\n\nThese two \".dxf\" \u001cles were loaded on Abaqus\n\nto create the parts that modelled both\n\nconstituents: the matrix and the \u001cbers that are displayed in Figure 6.24c and 6.24d, respectively.\nThose parts were assembled into a unique 3D RVE and a \u001cnite element mesh was generated\nusing this program\n\n7\n\n7 and the \u001cnal result is presented in Figure 6.25.\n\nThe GiDÂ® mesh generator was also tested but AbaqusÂ® produced meshes with higher quality.\n\n124\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nFigure 6.25: Representation of the 3D RVE and the \u001cnite element mesh generated by Abaqus\n\nWith the \u001cnite element mesh generated, a\n\nÂ®\n\n.\n\nJob was created in AbaqusÂ® and a \".inp\" \u001cle, that\n\nÂ®\n\ncontained the mesh data, was exported. Again, a MATLAB\n\nscript (described in Appendix E)\n\nwas created to convert the mesh data into a readable \u001cle for MSP.\nWhile creating the \u001cnite element meshes with Abaqus\n\nÂ®\n\n, the type of elements chosen were\n\ntetrahedrons and a large amount of nodes and elements were generated to model the behaviour\nof a cubic 3D RVE, which lead to a high demand of computational power to perform the \u001cnite\nelement analysis.\nThe input data \u001cles were generated but the MSP program could not \u001cnish the analysis due\nto lack of memory. Therefore, in order to overcome this obstacle, a computer cluster was used\nto run the MSP algorithm. However, the system of equations that results from the large number\nof nodes/elements was too big for the solver included in the program (PARDISO 5.00 (Kuzmin\net al., 2013; Schenk et al., 2008, 2007)) to compute, and the analysis failed once again. Even\nwith a more coarse mesh, the problem continued to occur.\nTo summarize, di\u001berent approaches were tested to estimate the e\u001bective elastic properties\nof 3D RVEs but, due to computational limitations, the procedures were not successful. One\nway to solve the problem given by the current solver (categorized as a direct solver), is to use\niterative solvers that may need fewer memory to complete the analysis.\n\n6.4 Conclusions\nSeveral numerical studies have been performed to determine, for the material under study, the\nstatistically representative RVE size. These studies included the in\u001duence of the image quality\nthat represents the microstructure of the material together with the appropriate treatment for\n\nChapter 6.\n\nParametric Studies on the Homogenized Elastic Properties\n\n125\n\ngenerating a \u001cnite element mesh and the impact of mesh parameters such as type of element\nemployed and mesh density on the solution.\nThe numerical results obtained with the strategy proposed in this work were systematically\ncompared and validated against analytical solutions available in the literature.\nMore over, the in\u001duence of the constituents' properties on the homogenized response was\nanalysed in detail for several cases by comparing analytical and numerical solutions.\n\n126\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nChapter 7\nIn\u001duence of the Interface Material on the\nE\u001bective Elastic Properties\n\nUntil this section, the homogenized properties were obtained considering composite materials\nwith only two phases. Because the properties of both constituents can be too di\u001berent, microdamaging nucleation mechanisms (cracking of particles, debonding or even fracture of the matrix\ndue to strong inclusions) may be observed during the deformation process (Chen et al., 2003),\nweakening the overall behaviour of the material.\nHowever, several studies have been made to understand the in\u001duence of a third interface\nmaterial between the inclusions and matrix. If the interface material is not strong enough, the\ndebonding may occur and, on the opposite, if the strength of the interface material is high, the\nprobability of debonding decreases and the microcracks start to happen in the matrix material\n(Zhang and Chen, 2012).\nNow that the in\u001duence of the sti\u001bness ratio on the homogenized properties of a second-phase\ncomposite material has been studied, it is important to understand the e\u001bect of the interface\nmaterial on the homogenized elastic properties of the composite.\nTherefore, some parametric studies are made while changing the sti\u001bness of not only the\nber material, but also of the interface. At the end, a mathematical function with good approximation with the results is found, allowing the use of this analytical function to extrapolate the\nhomogenized elastic properties without the need for numerical simulation. This study has been\nmade for speci\u001cc \u001cber volume fraction and two interfacial widths. Hence, any change on these\nvalues would result on the need of di\u001berent parameters to attain the same good agreement with\nthe results.\n\n7.1 Image Processing\nFirst of all, and since the easiest way to recognize di\u001berent materials in OOF2 is through\ndi\u001berent color values, the image that represents the 40 Ã— 40 RVE has to be modi\u001ced to include\n127\n\n128\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nthe interface material. In the previous chapter, the higher resolution of the RVE created after\nthe image tracing process proved to be an asset, since it improves the material boundaries\nenabling better results in the segmentation process, as such this will be the RVE used.\n\nÂ®\n\nSince the image modi\u001ccation presented in Section 6.1.3 was done with Adobe Illustrator\n\n,\n\nthe same program is used to create the interface material. After the image tracing process, the\nbers are represented by vector graphics and it is possible to modify them individually or as\na group. Therefore, all \u001cbers are selected (Figure 7.1) and a border is created with a speci\u001cc\nwidth. This border must be aligned to the outside of the selected \u001cbers to keep the same \u001cber\nvolume fraction from the initial RVE.\n\nFigure 7.1: Zoom on selected \u001cbers represented as vector graphics in the 40 Ã— 40 RVE.\n\nUsing the\n\nMeasure Tool, the average diameter of a \u001cber is gauged as 24 pixels. The repre-\n\nsentation of the initial RVE with a interface material of width equal to 10% of the \u001cber radius\n(weight stroke = 1.2 points)\n\n1 is presented in Figure 7.2. The rasterized image, exported with\n\nhigh quality (300 PPI) has a width and height of 2133 Ã— 2133 pixels.\nIn a black and white image, the presence of a material represented by a red color makes\nit di\u001ecult to identify the di\u001berent materials using the\n\nColor method2 set to a range of gray\n\nvalues. Thus, the red color (that illustrates the interface material in Figure 7.2) is replaced by a\ngray color, characterized by the 0.4 value in the gray scale (Figure 7.3a). To better understand,\nFigure 7.3b illustrates a single \u001cber surrounded by the interface material.\nWhile selecting the \u001cber material (black color), it is important that a similar \u001cber volume\nfraction is obtained when comparing it with the initial 40 Ã— 40 RVE. For that reason, after some\nexperiments, the value of 0.4 in the gray scale is chosen to represent the interface material.\n\n1\n2\n\nDimension used in Adobe IllustratorÂ® .\nDescribed in Section 4.2.2.\n\nChapter 7.\n\nIn\u001duence of the Interface Material on the E\u001bective Elastic Properties\n\n129\n\nFigure 7.2: Representation of the 40 Ã— 40 RVE with an interface material (red color) of width\nequal to 10% of the \u001cber radius.\n\n(a) Gray scale.\n\n(b) Single \u001cber with interface material.\n\nFigure 7.3: New color values of the 40 Ã— 40 RVE.\n\n7.2 Image Segmentation\nThe pixel selection process is done with the\n\nColor tool of OOF2. Considering the color of the\n\nbers and matrix as 1.0 and 0.0, respectively, the selection of the pixels assigned to the \u001cber\nmaterial is made with any black pixel targeted while the\nMoreover, to select the matrix material,\n\ndelta gray parameter is set to 0.55.\n\ndelta gray = 0.1 and a white pixel is targeted. Finally,\n\nboth \u001cber and matrix materials are elected simultaneously and, by inverting it, the interface\nmaterial is highlighted (Figure 7.4a).\n\n130\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nTo study the in\u001duence of the interface material on the homogenized elastic properties of the\nunidirectional \u001cber composite material, di\u001berent Young's modulus are assigned to this material.\nTwo di\u001berent cases are identi\u001ced: the interface is tougher than the matrix but softer than the\nber or the interface is the toughest material.\nTo take this into account, the sti\u001bness ratio between the \u001cber and matrix material is set to 10\nand the Young's modulus of the interface material ranges from the matrix Young's modulus to\nvalues higher than those of the \u001cber properties. For that purpose, a parameter q is created and\ndenotes the interface Young's modulus, Einter , normalized between the other two constituents'\nproperties:\n\nq=\n\nEinter âˆ’ Em\n,\nEf âˆ’ Em\n\n(7.1)\n\nwhere Ef and Em is the \u001cber and matrix Young's moduli, respectively. By changing the value\nof q , the Young's modulus of the interface varies and if q\n\n= 0, the interface is equal to the\n\nmatrix material and, on the contrary, if q = 1, the interface and the \u001cber materials share the\nsame properties. The elastic properties of these constituents are presented in Table 7.1.\nTable 7.1: Elastic properties assigned to each constituent of the RVE.\n\nFiber\nMatrix\nInterface\nâˆ—\n\nYoung's Modulus Poisson's Ratio Gray Color\n100 GPa\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n10 GPa\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n-\n\n0.3\n\nRGBâˆ—\n\nRed = 0.85, Green = 0.00, Blue = 0.00\n\n7.3 Finite Element Mesh Generation\nWith the image segmentation completed, the \u001cnite element mesh has to be generated. Similar\nto the process followed in Section 6.1.3, the initial skeleton is generated through the automated\nscript of OOF2, and further improved to lower the two elemental functionals:\n\nshape energy, while correctly characterizing the microstructure's geometry.\n\nhomogeneity and\n\n7.3.1 Mesh Size\nWith the insertion of a new material, the ideal element size must be de\u001cned again, and studies\nsimilar to the ones carried in Section 6.1.3 are performed. The width of the interface equals\n10% of the radius of the \u001cbers and, due to this extremely small dimension, the mesh has\nto be more re\u001cned in those parts.\n\nTherefore, the parameters used to generate the skeleton\n\nmaxscale, minscale and homogeneity threshold ) have to change to correctly \u001ct and model the\n\n(\n\nmicrostructure.\nThe\n\nmaxscale value is the same and equal to 0.2, since this is the biggest element size that\n\ncan be used to model the matrix and \u001cber materials for the 40 Ã— 40 RVE as mentioned in\n\nChapter 7.\n\nIn\u001duence of the Interface Material on the E\u001bective Elastic Properties\n\n131\n\nhomogeneity threshold is equal to 0.9 to avoid the re\u001cnement of\nelements that already have low homogeneity energy, preventing the generation of a large number\nSection 6.1.3. Moreover, the\n\nof unneeded nodes and elements, making the \u001cnite element analysis heavier. Finally, the only\nspeci\u001ccation that has to be changed is the\n\nminscale parameter, being the one that sets the\n\nsmallest element dimension.\nDue to the di\u001berence in material properties and to the small width of the interface, high\nstress distributions develop in the interfacial part.\ncorrectly characterize this phenomenon.\n\nThe\n\nHence, a \u001cner mesh should be made to\n\nminscale parameter is then de\u001cned as 0.1 to\n\nenable the formation of smaller elements in this part.\n\nIn Table 7.2, the information of two\n\ndi\u001berent mesh versions for the 40 Ã— 40 RVE are presented.\n\nThe \u001crst one is simply created\n\nthrough the automated script of OOF2 and then improved to lower the\n\nshape energy. The\n\nsecond version is created through the same procedure (with the same parameters), however, it\nis further re\u001cned in the parts of interest. Using the\n\nRe\u001cne routine (with Î± = 0.9) targeted in an\n\nexpanded selection of the interface elements and with the condition that it only re\u001cnes elements\nthat have area bigger than 0.01, the number of nodes and elements that de\u001cne the interfacial\npart of the microstructure increases. After the\n\nRe\u001cne tool has been applied, the Split Quads\n\nSwap Edges routines are used in the elements with homogeneity lower than 0.9 and the\nMerge Triangles and Rationalize routines are applied to lower the shape energy, that was high\nbecause of the application of the Re\u001cne tool with Î± = 0.9. To \u001cnalize, the Smooth method is\nand the\n\napplied (Î± = 0.15) for 10 iterations with the internal boundary nodes pinned.\nIn Table 7.3, values for an interface material softer than the \u001cber (q = 0.5) and tougher\nthan the \u001cber (q = 1.2) are analysed and only the Young's moduli, shear modulus and 2-norm\nof\n\nCâˆ— are presented, along with the respective relative di\u001berences between both versions.\nTable 7.2: Final information of both mesh versions of the 40 Ã— 40 RVE.\n\nMesh Nodes Elements Homogeneity\n1\n93081\n138377\n0.992\n2\n107259\n159781\n0.993\nTable 7.3: Comparison between both mesh versions for the 40 Ã— 40 RVE.\n\nq\n\n0.5\n\n1.2\n\nMesh\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\nE1âˆ—\n\nE2âˆ—\n\nE3âˆ—\n\nGâˆ—12\n\n2-norm of\n\nCâˆ— Unit\n\n20.388\n\n20.480\n\n45.051\n\n7.486\n\n60.411\n\nGPa\n\n0.011\n\n0.011\n\n0.007\n\n0.030\n\n0.010\n\n%\n\n20.386\n\n20.477\n\n45.054\n\n7.483\n\n60.417\n\nGPa\n\n20.941\n\n21.039\n\n49.877\n\n7.671\n\n64.594\n\nGPa\n\n0.020\n\n0.014\n\n0.053\n\n0.048\n\n0.037\n\n%\n\n20.937\n\n21.036\n\n49.904\n\n7.667\n\n64.618\n\nGPa\n\nWith these results it can be noticed that a more re\u001cned mesh in the interface part is not\n\n132\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nneeded and the version 1 is good enough to correctly characterize the microstructure behaviour,\nwhen estimating the homogenized elastic properties of the composite material.\n\nFigure 7.4\n\npresents the procedure from the image segmentation step until the generation of the \u001cnite\nelement mesh.\n\n(a) Pixel selection of the interface material.\n\n(b) Material map.\n\n(c) Skeleton geometry.\n\n(d) Finite element mesh.\n\nFigure 7.4:\n\nImage segmentation and \u001cnite element mesh generation for the RVE with the\n\ninterface material of width equal to 10% of the \u001cber radius.\n\n7.4 RVE Size\nDue to the insertion of a di\u001berent material in the microstructure, the RVE size that correctly\nrepresents it may change and, to validate the 40 Ã— 40 RVE, deemed as the optimal RVE size\nin the previous chapter, the estimated elastic properties obtained with this RVE are compared\nwith those obtained with the 50 Ã— 50 RVE.\nThe sti\u001bness ratio is 10, Em = 10 GPa and q = 0.5, meaning that Einter = 55 GPa.

However, to make\nsure that the values obtained are correct, it is important to validate the results \u001crst.\n\nValidation\nAs mentioned in Section 7.1 and 7.2, during the image manipulation and segmentation, it was\nimportant to secure a similar \u001cber volume fraction in both RVEs to have consistency in the\nresults. The gray color attributed to the interface material and the\n\ndelta gray parameters were\n\nde\u001cned with this purpose and the results are presented in Table 7.5. As it can be seen, the \u001cber\nvolume fraction is practically the same.\nTable 7.5: Volume fraction of each constituent of the 40 Ã— 40 RVEs without and with interface\nmaterial of various widths.\n\nRVE\nNo Interface\nInterface - 5%\nInterface - 10%\nInterface - 15%\n\nFiber Matrix Interface Unit\n35.07\n\n64.93\n\n-\n\n%\n\n34.98\n\n61.07\n\n3.95\n\n%\n\n35.12\n\n57.22\n\n7.66\n\n%\n\n34.92\n\n53.31\n\n11.77\n\n%\n\nWith this information, if one considers that the interface material is equal to the matrix\nmaterial (q\n\n= 0), these new RVEs may be considered the same as the one used in the last\n\nchapter. Therefore, a comparison can be made between the results already obtained (from the\n\n134\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nRVE without interface and analysed in Chapter 6) and the values attained from these RVEs,\nwith q\n\n= 0, and computed with the Mortar Periodic boundary condition.\n\nThe results are\n\nobtained for a sti\u001bness ratio of 10 and presented in Table 7.6, where the values located in the\nsecond rows of the 5%, 10% and 15% RVEs are the relative di\u001berences between the respective\nand the RVE with no interface.\nTable 7.6: Comparison between the results obtained from the 40 Ã— 40 RVEs without and with\ninterface material of various widths.

The sti\u001bness ratio between \u001cber and matrix is set to 10 and the values of the\n\nâˆ—\n\nhomogenized plane Young's modulus, Ep , are illustrated in Figure 7.5 for both interfacial widths.\nThere is a higher discretization of the parameter q between the 0.0 and 0.2 to better de\u001cne that\nrange.\nThe dependency is similar to the one found in Figure 6.23, that relates the homogenized\nplane Young's modulus with the sti\u001bness ratio of the \u001cber and matrix materials, i.e. the sti\u001bness\nof the interface material becomes less important as it increases. Furthermore, and as expected,\n\nChapter 7.\n\nIn\u001duence of the Interface Material on the E\u001bective Elastic Properties\n\n135\n\nFigure 7.5: In\u001duence of the interface material with di\u001berent widths on the homogenized plane\n\nâˆ—\n\nYoung's modulus, Ep .\n\nthe width of this material is a major factor regarding the overall properties of the composite\nmaterial. The slope in the stabilized part (q > 0.6) is higher for higher widths.\nIn Figure 7.6, the results for the shear modulus are presented and one can notice that, both\ne\u001bective plane Young's and shear moduli have the same trend.\n\nFigure 7.6: In\u001duence of the interface material with di\u001berent widths on the homogenized plane\n\nâˆ—\n\nshear modulus, G12 .\n\n136\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\n7.5.2 Di\u001berent Sti\u001bness Ratios\nThe results obtained in the last section were computed for a sti\u001bness ratio of 10. In this section,\ndi\u001berent sti\u001bness ratios are tested to analyse if this parameter has any in\u001duence on the way the\nhomogenized properties depend on the interface material.\nFigure 7.7 illustrates the same as Figure 7.5 but for a sti\u001bness ratio of 10, 35 an 70. The\ndi\u001berent interfacial widths are also presented in this \u001cgure and the homogenized plane Young's\nmodulus is normalized dividing the result by the Young's modulus of the matrix material.\n\nFigure 7.7: In\u001duence of the interface material with di\u001berent widths on the normalized e\u001bective\n\nÂ ̄âˆ— , for di\u001berent sti\u001bness ratios of the \u001cber/matrix materials.\nplane Young's modulus, E\np\n\nAnalysing these results, it is possible to verify that the conclusion withdrawn in Section 6.2\nis admissible, i.e. increasing the sti\u001bness ratio between the \u001cber/matrix materials does not have\na big impact for values higher than 20/30.\n\nFor instance, the di\u001berence in the homogenized\n\nproperties while increasing the sti\u001bness ratio from 10 to 35 is large, but from 35 to 70 this\ndi\u001berence sharply decreases. Having a unidirectional \u001cber composite material characterized by\na sti\u001bness ratio of 35 and with a width of 10% of the \u001cber radius produces, for a q > 0.04,\nbetter results than a composite with a sti\u001bness ratio of 70 and with a width of 5%. Even more,\nif one considers interfaces tougher than the \u001cber material, a composite with sti\u001bness ratio of\n10 and width of 15% has the same plane Young's modulus than one with sti\u001bness ratio of 70\nand width of 5%.\nThe same type of dependency is found in the three di\u001berent sti\u001bness ratios tested. Moreover,\nthe slope at the beginning increases with the sti\u001bness ratio.\n\nChapter 7.\n\nIn\u001duence of the Interface Material on the E\u001bective Elastic Properties\n\n137\n\n7.5.3 Analytical Expressions\nSince, for di\u001berent sti\u001bness ratios, the homogenized plane Young's modulus seems to be approximated by the same type of mathematical expression, a curve \u001ctting is performed.\nMATLAB\n\nÂ® Curve Fitting Tool\n\nThe\n\nis used for this purpose.\n\nInterfacial Width = 10%\nAll the results presented in this section are obtained considering that the width of the interface\nmaterial is 10% of the \u001cber radius. Therefore, using the curve \u001ctting tool, it is possible to \u001ct\nthe values obtained for a sti\u001bness ratio of 10 to a sum of two exponential functions, denoted\nby:\n\nEÂ ̄pâˆ— = a exp(b Â· q) + c exp(d Â· q),\n\n(7.2)\n\nwhere a, b, c and d are constants that characterize the mathematical expression. In the case of\na sti\u001bness ratio of 10, these parameters are:\n\na = 2.0146,\n\n(7.3a)\n\nb = 0.0355,\n\n(7.3b)\n\nc = âˆ’0.2035,\n\n(7.3c)\n\nd = âˆ’6.8207,\n\n(7.3d)\n\nand the curve \u001ctting is demonstrated in Figure 7.8. In this \u001cgure, along with the values obtained\nfor the sti\u001bness ratio of 10, two other di\u001berent sti\u001bness ratios are presented with the respective\nexponential curve \u001cttings. The approximations are made with an expression equal to Equation\n(7.2), but with di\u001berent parameters. Thus, increasing the discretization of the sti\u001bness ratio,\nTable 7.7 presents the respective a, b, c and d parameters for all cases, along with the respective\n\n2\n\ncoe\u001ecient of determination, R , of the curve \u001cttings to the numerical results.\nThe values shown in Table 7.7, demonstrate that, despite the fact that the coe\u001ecient of\n\n2\n\ndetermination (characterized by R ) worsens as the sti\u001bness ratio increases, the curve \u001cttings\nare excellent approximations to the results obtained by the numerical method. The exponential\ncurve \u001cttings were made with the \u001ct option robust \"Bisquare\" selected.\n\nIt enabled a better\n\napproximation for all points except for q = 0 that, as the sti\u001bness ratio increases, is not correctly\nexpressed by Equation (7.2).

Using Adobe Illustrator\n\nÂ®\n\n, the micrograph was modi\u001ced and a new color was\n\ninserted around the \u001cber inclusions, to be later interpreted as a new material by OOF2.\nTo extract valid results, in the \u001crst place it was veri\u001ced that the RVE size is not in\u001duenced\nby the insertion of this new material, thus, the 40 Ã— 40 RVE continues to correctly characterize\nthe microstructure behaviour.\nThe study was carried for the overall in-plane properties of the composite material, more\n\nâˆ—\n\nspeci\u001ccally the e\u001bective plane Young's modulus, Ep . Analysing the results, it can be concluded\nthat the in\u001duence of the elastic properties of the interface material on this homogenized properties are high. Not only the elastic properties but also the width of the interface material plays\na major role on the overall properties of the composite material. There are cases where having\na larger width is better than increasing the sti\u001bness ratio between \u001cber/matrix materials.\nFurthermore, since the dependency of the homogenized plane Young's modulus over the\nYoung's modulus of the interface material (represented by the parameter\n\nq ) seemed to be\n\n142\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nsimilar for di\u001berent sti\u001bness ratios, a curve \u001ctting was made using the\nMATLAB\n\nÂ®\n\nCurve Fitting Tool of\n\n. It was revealed that the results can be expressed by a sum of two exponential\n\nfunctions characterized by four parameters (a, b, c and d) and that these parameters depend on\nthe sti\u001bness ratio of the \u001cber/matrix materials. Thus, the homogenized plane Young's modulus\n\n2\n\nis approximated (with a high coe\u001ecient of determination - R ) by a mathematical expression\nthat is de\u001cned by more four mathematical functions. Moreover, for a speci\u001cc volume fraction, it\nonly depends on the sti\u001bness ratio, on the parameter q and on the interfacial width. The errors\npresented in Table 7.9 are small, meaning that the mathematical approximation is successful.\nTo summarize, by using a program to manipulate the micrograph of the material, a new\nRVE was created and new conclusions were withdrawn by analysing it. The DIB microstructure\nrecognition technique is extremely \u001dexible, enabling a minimal change on a RVE to be translated\ninto new outcomes and conclusions.\n\nChapter 8\nConclusions and Future Works\n\nA methodology based on image acquisition and recognition has been proposed to model the\nbehaviour of heterogeneous materials at the microscale.\n\nIt is not based on assumptions or\n\nsimpli\u001ccations, as it considers the microstructure geometry given by real micrographs. At the\nbeginning of the document the goals are settled, being analysed hereafter.\nAs mentioned in the introductory chapter, two initial chapters of bibliographic references\n\nContinuum Mechanics, Micromechanics and Multi-Scale\nmodels are introduced as the foundations that support the next chapters. With Continuum\nMechanics, the assumption that solids may be modelled as a continuum medium, facilitates the\nunderstanding of their overall behaviour while loaded or deformed. Micromechanics enables the\nare presented, were concepts such as\n\nstudy of heterogeneous materials by analysing them at the microscale level, thus, considering\nthe in\u001duence of each constituent (considered as continuum) to model the overall behaviour of\nthe material. Finally,\n\nMulti-Scale models create the bridge between both macro and microscale\n\nand introduce a new and reliable method to simulate the behaviour of multi-phase materials.\nFurthermore, to characterize the microstructure of the material, the concept of\n\nVolume Element (RVE) is introduced in Section 3.1.\n\nRepresentative\n\nThe main aspect of this thesis is the use of real micrographs to create RVEs that model\nthe concerned material.\n\nHence, the\n\nDigital Image Based (DIB) microstructure recognition\n\nÂ®\n\ntechnique is introduced and described in Chapter 4, with the support of two Linux\nsource programs:\n\nOOF2 and OOF3D. Usually,\n\nopen-\n\nMulti-Scale models use simpli\u001ced RVEs to\n\npredict the impact of singularities with di\u001berent characteristics in the microstructure of the\nmaterial.\n\nIn this case, with the use of real micrographs, the method becomes more general,\n\nmodelling heterogeneous materials of any complexity, being it metallic, ceramic, polymeric or\ncomposites.\nThe programs used to perform the image recognition and generate the \u001cnite element mesh\nhave yet several limitations. In OOF2, minor bugs add a degree of di\u001eculty when analysing\nimages of high quality that need to be modelled by a large amount of nodes and elements.\nMoreover, OOF3D presents errors that prevent its usage during this thesis, since the output\n143\n\n144\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nle cannot be saved in the format needed.\n\nÂ®\n\nusing the GiD\n\nand the Abaqus\n\nÂ®\n\nNonetheless, other methods were tested such as,\n\nprograms to generate the \u001cnite element meshes for 3D\n\nRVEs that had 2D micrographs as cross section. However, these attempts created a number\nof nodes/elements that could not be analysed by the\n\nMicro-Scale Problem (MSP), due to a\n\nlimitation on the amount of memory that the direct solver (PARDISO 5.0.0) can allocate.\nThe main goal of this thesis was to use the aforementioned DIB microstructure recognition\nand\n\nMulti-Scale models to estimate the homogenized elastic properties of heterogeneous mate-\n\nrials. In Chapter 5, other than introducing the numerical methodology used to obtain these\nproperties from \u001cnite element analyses, also presented several analytical expressions that aim\nto estimate these values through\n\nmean \u001celd approaches.\n\nThe ideal size of RVE that should be used was the \u001crst parametric study performed in\nthis thesis, as it is one the most important factors to take into account when using\n\nMulti-Scale\n\nmodels. It was proved that RVEs smaller than this optimal size are likely to give wrong results\nand that, for a unidirectional \u001cber composite, the smallest RVE size that still is statistically\nrepresentative of the microstructure should be around 15/20 times larger than the size of a\nsingle \u001cber (inclusion). Moreover, the re\u001cnement of the \u001cnite element mesh was also studied\n\na priori, since the results obtained with the Finite Element Method are highly dependent on\nthis aspect.\n\nFor the analysed case, an element size of approximately one fourth of the \u001cber\n\nradius enabled accurate results. In addition, the image quality of the micrograph plays a major\nrole on the results, since higher quality enables a better characterization of the microstructure.\nHowever, due to the fact that the phases' volume fraction may change, one should be careful\nwhen manipulating a micrograph. After all, this parameter drives the whole homogenized elastic\nproperties.\nFurthermore, all results obtained in Chapter 6 were consistent with the literature.\n\nThe\n\nMortar Periodic boundary condition converged faster to the theoretical value and was always\nenclosed by the Linear and Uniform Traction boundary conditions, that de\u001cne the upper and\nlower bounds, respectively. Also, the results achieved with the numerical method were similar\n\nMori-Tanaka analytical model. This is, the numerical method,\nbased on the combination of Multi-Scale models and DIB microstructure recognition techniques,\nto the ones predicted by the\n\nproduced results with extremely small relative di\u001berences, for cases that could be compared with\nknown results. Therefore, these results indicate that this numerical model is accurate enough\nto predict the mechanical behaviour of heterogeneous materials of higher complexity, for which\nthe analytical methods, mentioned in the literature, are not able to provide results.\nIn Chapter 7, the in\u001duence of an interface material on the homogenized properties was\nanalysed. The RVE size remained the same and a study on the mesh size was also carried out,\nleading to the conclusion that for the purpose of this thesis, a mesh of similar size continued\nto be re\u001cned enough. The impact of the interface on the homogenized properties is high and\nseems to increase linearly with larger widths. Furthermore, mathematical expressions were deduced to obtain the homogenized plane Young's modulus, while taking into consideration the\nsti\u001bness ratio between \u001cber/matrix materials, the Young's modulus of the interface material\n\nChapter 8.\n\nConclusions and Future Projects\n\n145\n\n2\n\nand its width. The average coe\u001ecient of determination (R ) of these equations with the numerical results is above 0.995, which means that the homogenized plane Young's modulus can\nbe accurately estimated by them.\nDespite the fact that throughout this work, only heterogeneous materials up to three di\u001berent constituents have been analysed, the proposed methodology does not have any limitation\nregarding this aspect.\n\nÂ®\n\nTo summarize, di\u001berent MATLAB\n\nscripts were created to connect the di\u001berent programs\n\nused throughout the thesis and the \u001cnal results are extremely satisfactory.\n\nApart from the\n\nuse of OOF3D to estimate the homogenized properties from 3D RVEs due to computational\nlimitations, all goals were completed.\n\nThe results presented in this thesis are considered as\n\na good starting point in the use of this methodology to model the microscopic behaviour of\nmaterials that are becoming progressively more complex.\n\n8.1 Future Works\nRelying on the work earlier presented, further developments and validations could be done\nwith a combined e\u001bort of experimental and numerical procedures.\n\nFor instance, comparing\n\nthe elastic properties of a heterogeneous material obtained through experimental methods with\nthose obtained by the DIB microstructure recognition technique (using a real micrograph of the\nconcerned material).\nSince there are no analytical methods to estimate the elastic properties of highly complex\nmaterials (e.g. materials with a large number of constituents or with singularities with unusual\nshapes), this type of approach could add more credibility to the presented methodology.\n\nIn\n\naddition, it could support the study of 3D RVEs (with an upgraded version of OOF3D or with\na di\u001berent open-source or commercial program).\nFurthermore, since in this thesis only the elastic domain was addressed, new studies about\nnon-elasticity or fracture damage could be developed. The current knowledge in this areas is\nlimited, and through this procedure, the impact of singularites of higher complexity could be\nstudied.\n\nInterface Materials\nIn Chapter 7, analytical equations were proposed to obtain the homogenized plane Young's\nmodulus of unidirectional \u001cber composites.\n\nThis study can be extended to other elasticity\n\nconstants (e.g. plane shear modulus or Poisson's ratio).\nMoreover, only three di\u001berent widths were analysed and a relation could be identi\u001ced between this parameter and the homogenized property. Therefore, by increasing the discretization\nof the interfacial width, a new mathematical equation that would depend on two arguments\n(parameter q and interfacial width) may be identi\u001ced, as illustrated in Figure 8.1 (this representation is purely \u001cgurative, since it was created solely based on three di\u001berent widths). This 3D\n\n146\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nFigure 8.1: 3D representation of and extended version of Equation (7.2).\n\nsurface would depend on the sti\u001bness ratio between \u001cber/matrix and on the width and Young's\nmodulus of the interface material.\nIn addition, and with the purpose of creating a more general empiric expression, the \u001cber\nvolume fraction can also be changed, making Equations (7.4) dependent of not only the sti\u001bness\nratio but also on the \u001cber volume fraction. This would make the whole assembly of equations\n((7.2); (7.4)) as 3D surface mathematical expressions, leading to a model that would be able to\ncharacterize the plane Young's modulus of any unidirectional \u001cber composite (with Î1⁄2m = Î1⁄2f =\n\n0.3).\n\nAppendix A\nRelations between Elastic Constants\n\nThe sti\u001bness and compliance tensors,\nconstants.\n\nC and S, respectively, are characterized by elasticity\n\nIn Table A.1, the relations between the most common constants are presented,\n\nwhere E , G and Î1⁄2 represent the Young's modulus, the Shear modulus and the Poisson's ratio\nand K and Î» denote the Bulk modulus and the LamÃ©'s \u001crst parameter, respectively.\n\nTable A.1: Relations between elastic constants.\n\nÎ»\n\nG\n\nE\n\nÎ1⁄2\n\nK\n\nÎ»,G\n\nÎ»\n\nG\n\nG(3Î»+2G)\nÎ»+G\n\nÎ»\n2(Î»+G)\n\nÎ» + 23 G\n\nÎ»,E\n\nÎ»\n\nEâˆ’3Î»+r\n4\n\nE\n\n2Î»\nE+Î»+r\n\nE+3Î»+r\n6\n\nÎ»,Î1⁄2\n\nÎ»\n\nÎ»(1âˆ’2Î1⁄2\n2Î1⁄2\n\nÎ»(1+Î1⁄2)(1âˆ’2Î1⁄2)\nÎ1⁄2\n\nÎ1⁄2\n\nÎ»(1+Î1⁄2)\n3Î1⁄2\n\nÎ»,K\n\nÎ»\n\n3\n2 (K âˆ’ Î»)\n\n9K(Kâˆ’Î»\n3Kâˆ’Î»\n\nÎ»\n3Kâˆ’Î»\n\nK\n\nG,E\n\nG(Eâˆ’2G)\n3Gâˆ’E\n\nG\n\nE\n\nEâˆ’2G\n2G\n\nGE\n3(3Gâˆ’E)\n\nG,Î1⁄2\n\n2Î1⁄2G\n1âˆ’2Î1⁄2\n\nG\n\n2G(1 + Î1⁄2)\n\nÎ1⁄2\n\n2G(1+Î1⁄2)\n3(1âˆ’2Î1⁄2)\n\nG,K\n\nK âˆ’ 23 G\n\nG\n\n9KG\n3K+G\n\n3Kâˆ’2G\n6K+2G\n\nK\n\nE,Î1⁄2\n\nEÎ1⁄2\n(1+Î1⁄2)(1âˆ’2Î1⁄2)\n\nE\n2(1+v)\n\nE\n\nÎ1⁄2\n\nE\n3(1âˆ’2Î1⁄2)\n\nE,K\n\n3K(3Kâˆ’E)\n9Kâˆ’E\n\n3KE\n9Kâˆ’E\n\nE\n\n3Kâˆ’E\n6K\n\nK\n\nÎ1⁄2,K\n\n3KÎ1⁄2\n1+Î1⁄2\n\n3K(1âˆ’2Î1⁄2)\n2(1+Î1⁄2)\n\n3K(1 âˆ’ 2Î1⁄2)\n\nÎ1⁄2\n\nK\n\nr=\n\n147\n\nâˆš\nE 2 + 9Î»2 + 2EÎ»\n\n148\n\nFaculty of Engineering of the University of Porto\n\nAppendix B\nMATLABÂ® Script for the Interface of\nOOF2-MSP\n\nAppendix B contains the code developed to connect OOF2 with MSP.
