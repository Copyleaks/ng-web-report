An expanded critical perspective on design is thus developed that looks at\n\ntechnological systems -such as software- and the cultures that produce them, with their histories and\n\nregimes of power, as crucial participants in, rather than as neutral vessels for, the design and production of\n\nour built environment.\nThe dissertation ranges from examining the politics of representation, participation and authorship in\n\nthe systems imagined by members of the Computer-Aided Design Project -in particular that of Steven Coons\n\nand Nicholas Negroponte's \"man-machine\" design systems- to discussing the culture of BIM\n\ncoordination through an ethnographic portrait and data-visualization of its practice at Gehry Technologies, in\n\ntwo large-scale projects in the United Arab Emirates.\nAs this study demonstrates, technological discourses and artifacts act as brokers for culturally dominant\n\nconceptions of design, representation, and work.\n\nThesis Supervisor: Terry W. Knight\nTitle: Professor of Design and Computation\n\n3\n\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nDaniel Cardoso Llach grew up in Bogoti, Colombia. He earned a Bachelor of Architecture from\n\nUniversidad de los Andes, and subsequently taught there from 2002 to 2005. He then earned a Masters of\n\nScience in Architecture Studies (SMArchS) at MIT. His thesis explored the generative potential, and\n\ncultural dimension, of digital fabrication for architecture. It was funded by the Center of Bits and Atoms\n\nat the MIT MediaLab, and was awarded the Best SMArchS Thesis prize. In 2007, he started his doctoral\n\nprogram with the support of a Presidential Fellowship. He has lectured and conducted numerous\n\nworkshops on computational design in universities in Latin America, the US, and the Middle East, and\n\npublished several articles on peer-reviewed publications. Cardoso Llach recently co-chaired the editorial\n\nboard of the Sigradi (Iberoamerican Society of Digital Graphics) international conference, and is a member\n\nof the scientific committee of several academic bodies including Sigradi, the International Committeefor Desgn\n\nHistory and Design Studies, and the Dearq journal. As an architect and computational specialist, Cardoso\n\nLlach has consulted for Gehry Technologies (Middle East) and Kohn Pedersen Fox (New York), as well as an\n\nindependent licensed architect and designer in his native Bogoti.\n\nIt\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to thank my colleagues and interlocutors at MIT and Gehry Technologies, Abu\n\nDhabi, for their openness and friendship during my time as a researcher and colleague. My hope is that\n\nthis study helps raise novel questions and insights about the practices they all know so well.\n\nTerry Knight, my committee chair, offered me unwavering support and friendship during the many\n\nstages of my doctoral work at MIT. Her attentive reading and criticism of this dissertation's drafts taught\n\nme about intellectual generosity and academic rigor. I am also grateful to her for letting me collaborate\n\nrepeatedly in the Inquiry into Design and Computation course. This dissertation expands on the themes\n\nand questions nurtured there.\n\nI am grateful to Lucy Suchman, who encouraged me in my quest to take on the difficult questions\n\nabout humans and machines concerning design, and motivated me to explore new forms of academic\n\ninquiry. From her I learned the strength of critical, constructive, engaged, scholarship. I am also indebted\n\nto her for the detailed reading and commenting of the drafts, and for hours of truly generative\n\nconversations.\n\nRosalind Williams, who joined the committee at a later stage, showed me new ways to think about\n\ntechnology's ties with the imagination and desire. I am indebted to her for teaching me to be wary of the\n\ncloudbanks of theorizing, and for long email conversations that generated crucial insights for this project.\n\nI am thankful to Takehiko Nagakura, who always offered me concise and sharp criticism, forcing me to\n\nalways look at my work from different perspectives.\n\nBesides my committee, other scholars have been key to the development of the arguments in this study,\n\nand to my own intellectual growth. I would specially like to thank Leo Marx for encouraging me to\n\nnurture my critical voice, and George Stiny, for showing me ways to think about design as an irreducibly\n\nopen-ended practice. I would also like to thank Dennis Shelden for his generosity in discussing the\n\nquestions this dissertation explored, and for his willingness to help me find ways to pursue them. This\n\ndissertation would have taken a very different shape without his curiosity and interest. I also thank Nasser\n\nRabat and Bill Porter, for contributing in various ways to this dissertation. The late Bill Mitchell's\n\nintellectual rigor, generosity and personal warmth will always be a reference for me. I feel very lucky for\n\nhaving had the chance of being his student and collaborator during a good part of my life at MIT.\n\nThe community at the MIT archives and the MIT Museum collections provided me with access to\n\ncrucial materials for my research. In particular, I'm indebted to Denise Wernikoff and Theresa Smith for\n\ngoing out of their way to provide me with prompt access to documents and artifacts from the early days of\n\ncomputation at MIT.\n\n5\n\n\nI'm also very grateful to MIT Anthropology and STS faculty and students. Hanna Rose Shell's writing\n\nseminar was a crucial arena of conversation and constructive critical feedback. I am thankful to the\n\nparticipants, among them David Singerman, Teasel Muir-Harmony and Rebbecca Uchill, whose\n\nfeedback on some very early drafts helped me shape the questions from which this dissertation later\n\nemerged.\n\nI have published earlier versions of some of this dissertation's chapters, which have benefited from the\n\nprocess of editorial review. These include Thresholds, edited by AdamJohnson; Dearq journal, edited by\n\nMaarten Goosens, and AD Architectural Design, edited by Xavier De Kestelier and Brady Peters. I thank\n\nthem, and the journal's reviewers, for providing me with valuable criticisms that challenged me to sharpen\n\nsome of the arguments in the text. I also would like to thank the Society for the Social Studies of Science\n\n(4S) conference in Tokyo, 2010, for a great atmosphere of discussion and debate where I had the privilege\n\nof presenting early portions of this dissertation. I would also like to thank Axel Paredes for the opportunity\n\nto share early stages of this work with the architecture community at the Universidad Francisco\n\nMarroquin (UFM) in Guatemala City.\n\nAn early source of insight, questions and inspiration for this research was a series of workshops on\n\ncomputational design and fabrication I taught and co-taught mainly during the early years of my\n\ndoctorate in Universidad de Chile, Santiago; Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, Lima; Harvard\n\nUniversity, Cambridge; Lynden High School, Lynden; Cornell University, Ithaca; Universidad de los\n\nAndes, Bogoti; Universidad Francisco Marroquin, Guatemala, and American University of Sharjah. I\n\nwould like to thank the students, fellow instructors and enablers of these workshops, among themJohn\n\nSnavely, Skylar Tibbits, Kenfield Griffith, Axel Paredes, Rafael Villaz6n, Pablo C. Herrera, Bob McNeel,\n\nTaro Narahara, Santino Medina and Maher El Khaldi.\n\nThe MIT Department of Architecture was my home, and also a crucial source of support for this\n\ndissertation. I want to thank specially Renee A. Caso for her friendship and advice on all matters\n\nincluding the robust -yet sometimes intricate- administrative scaffoldings of doctoral life at MIT;\n\nAnnette Horne-Williams, for her assistance on all departmental matters; Daniela Stoudenkova, for her\n\nadministrative assistance on Design and Computation matters; Duncan Kincaid,Jesse Kaminsky,\n\nEduardo Gonzalez, Tom Fitzgerald and Ricky Leisersson -from the quasi-legendary \"cron\" office of the\n\nMIT School of Architecture and Planning- for reliably providing crucial assistance on technical matters.\n\nI would also like to thank Aurora Brule, from the MIT International Students Office, for helping me\n\nnavigate countless times the difficult waters of migratory and work regulations.\n\nMy work has also benefited from the proximity of my friends and colleagues in the Design and\n\nComputation group, whose wonderfully diverse work has greatly inspired and challenged me throughout\n\nmy life at MIT. I'm grateful to Yanni Loukissas, who has been a crucial interlocutor and source of insight\n\n6\n\n\nduring the development of this dissertation, and Kenfield Griffith, an unparalleled office mate and\n\nteaching partner. I am also grateful to Saeed Arida, Rizal Muslimin, Dina El-Zafaly, Ash Arpak, Onur\n\nGun, Kaustuv Des Biswas, Alise Upitis, Lira Nikolovska, and many more in the group.\n\nMy work has also benefited from the many exciting conversations about design at THE MEME. I would\n\nlike to thank Hyejin Lee, Carlos Cardenas and Kostas Terzidis for this opportunity.\n\nOther friendships were also significant in helping me proceed with my research, sometimes by\n\nproviding a refreshing space of conversation and thinking outside the boundaries of my work, other times\n\nby providing invaluable emotional and practical support. I would like to thank them for the music made\n\nand shared, the countless jokes about our scholarly lives, and all the movies and all the conversations.\n\nAndres Lombana, Ateya Khorakiwala, Gishnu Das, Yanni Loukissas, Kenfield Griffith, Saeed Arida,\n\nArturo Dominguez, Carlos Rocha and Hyun Lee. I know our conversations will continue.\n\nI would also like to thank my mom, dad, brother and sister, for having always been there despite the\n\nprolonged radio silences. Also, I would like to thank my family in-law, for their constant support and love\n\nin the distance.\n\nI dedicate this dissertation to Nida, with all of my love, gratitude, and thirst for more adventures\n\ntogether.\n\n7\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n1.

BIBLIOGRAPHY 201\n\n11\n\n\n12\n\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nArgument outline\n\nThis dissertation aims to enrich our understanding of technology's central role in the contemporary\n\nproduction of our built environment. It presents an empirical study of the technology project known in\n\nindustry as Building 1nfornation Modeling situated in the context of the intellectual history of computational\n\nrepresentations of architecture. It shows how technological discourses and artifacts act as brokers of\n\nculturally dominant conceptions of design, design representation, and work.\n\nThe dissertation develops predominately around two related lines of inquiry. The first explores the\n\ndiscourses of design articulated by members of the engineering culture developing around the Computer-\n\nAided Design Project, a research operation funded by the US Air Force, active between 1959 and 1967, at\n\nMIT. I show how the engineers and technologists of the Project re-imagined design, in the language of the\n\ncomputer, as the iterative performance of a cybernetic \"man-machine\" problem-solving engine. I further\n\nidentify the emergence, in this context, of a new representational tradition expressed by the indexical\n\ncombination, in the computer, of Albertian perspectivalism and data processing. I submit the thesis that\n\nthrough both technical and discursive innovations, the engineers at the Project reconfigured notions of\n\ndesign, design representation, and work, shaping the discourses underpinning the contemporary\n\nproduction of the built environment.' To illustrate this, I trace these engineers' technological imagination\n\nof design across disciplines, into architecture. On one hand, I situate the work by architectural and design\n\ntheorist Nicholas Negroponte within the \"knowledge space\" 2 of the Computer-Aided Design Project,\n\nhighlighting his use of the Project's rhetorical and technical instruments to contest traditional conceptions\n\nof architectural authorship and practice -moreover, I identify the contradictions of Negroponte's\n\npopulist claims about technologically enabled bottom-up participation, situating them within a rationalist\n\ntradition that ramifies variously into contemporary design cultures. On the other hand, I also review the\n\nI I use \"production of the built environment\" and \"production of architecture\" interchangeably throughout the text,\nas a phrase to avoid the design and construction dualism.\n2 In his study of Gothic cathedral construction, Turnbull uses the expression \"knowledge space\" to refer to the social\nand material dimensions of particular contexts of work and practice. David Turnbull, Masons, Tricksters and\nCartographers: Comparative Studies in the Sociology of Scientific and Indigenous Knovledge, 1st ed. (Taylor & Francis, 2000).\n\n13\n\n\nthe clients who commissioned the work and the artisans who constructed it\"81 and \"recognized that a few\n\nisolated practitioners, however gifted, could not transform architecture from craft into a profession. They\n\nexperimented with partnerships and large offices as new forms for architectural practice.\"32 However, it\n\nwas not until the formalization of academic training and the constitution of professional associations\n\nduring the second half of the nineteenth century that architects were able to establish a distinct social and\n\nprofessional status. Accounts of US-American professionalization highlight the role that a generation of\n\narchitects trained in the Parisian Ecole de Beaux-Arts played in the struggle for architecture's professional\n\nlegitimacy. This generation, which included Richard Morris Hunt, Henry Hobson Richardson, Daniel\n\nBurnham, and Dankmar Adler, sought to combine professional practice and instruction following the\n\nmodel of the French atelier -a collective space run by students who compose projects under the direction\n\nof a patron. 83 These architects were the first to initiate professional associations and the writing of the\n\nlicensing laws that regulated access into the profession. The firms of Richard Morris Hunt and Henry\n\nHobson Richardson were both places of instruction and practice, 84 and exerted great influence in the first\n\nformal training programs in architecture.85 In fact, the first of such programs (MIT's) was first headed by\n\none of Henry Morris Hunt's employees, Robert Ware, in 1865.86 Ware's vision was that MIT would train\n\ndraftsmen to feed the professional firms:87\n\n... The primary aim of the new program at MIT at its outset was not the\neducation of architects per se, but rather the education of architectural draftsmen\nwhose competent exercise of technical judgment in matters of everyday practice\nwould be an aid to architects in the pursuit of their art and business and would\nhelp to raise the overall quality and repute of the profession.8 8\n\nAt the same time, however, he was sharply aware of the role academia could play in the architecture's\n\nstruggle for a higher social standing.\n\nThe profession is, at present, in the hands of mechanics, many of whom are\nfirst-rate; of contractors and super-intendents, who are mechanics with a talent for\n\nLatrobe proclaimed himself \"the first professional architect and engineer to practice in the US\" and complained\nprofusely about the profession's lack of social standing. Ibid., 7.\n81 Woods, From Craft to Profession.\n82 Ibid., 5.\n83 Very much like architectural studios today.\n84Johnston, Drafting Culture, 33.\n83 The commitment to the ideal of architectural practice was so strong that in fact the programs shedded any\ncommercial connection of the architect to the project. This allegiance to self-lessness was perceived by many\narchitects to be a part of the AIA code up until the 1970s, as Robert Gutman shows in Gutman, Architectural Practice,\n47.\n86 MIT was also the first architecture school in North America.\n87 Draftsmanship was the necessary \"entry\" to the profession.\n88 Johnston, Drafting Culture, 33.\n\n31\n\n\naffairs, and many of whom take the name of architects; of architects proper, few of\n\nwhom have an adequate training in the higher branches of their calling.8 9\n\nWare favored a \"learning by doing\" approach -that still resonates at the MIT School of Architecture\n\nand Planning as a guiding pedagogical narrative. 90 The appearance of architecture programs like MIT's\n\nwithin US-American universities during the second half of the nineteenth century was effective in raising\n\nthe social and professional status of their alumni above those who obtained their credentials in mechanics\n\nschools, or in night schools.\n\nClass tensions and the corporatization of practice\n\nAcademically trained architects with knowledge of history and theory, and endowed with artistic\n\naspirations, were, according to Johnston, \"indoctrinated into an elite and often elitist culture of\n\narchitectural design\" 9 1 that carved them a professional and social space apart and above the \"practical\n\narchitects\" and the contingencies of materials and labor.\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century the increased use of mass-produced standardized materials\n\nsuch as steel and glass demanded increased precision, detail and volume in building's documentation,\n\nprompting organizational changes in the architecture office as well as an increase of its size. Some\n\narchitects, like Herbert Kenway from Boston, would find enough clients to develop successful practices\n\n(See Frame).\n\n\"My great-grandfather Herbert Kenway was an architect who was trained in the UK (he was\n\nfrom Wales himself) and who moved to the Boston area as a relatively young man. He\n\nmarried a woman from a Boston family (with abolitionist roots, but that is another story) and\n\nthey had four children together in the 1880s, living in Newton, as he developed his practice.\n\nThis became a firm called Allen and Kenway which did houses in the Back Bay and suburbs,\n\nas well as projects like the Newton High School. Kenway died at the early age of 39 in 1890\n\n(cancer? no one is sure) and now lies in Newton Cemetery along with his wife and two\n\ndaughters. At one point I was showing his early sketch book, from his years in the UK, as\n\nwell as some other materials I inherited (including a big collection of Ruskin's works!) to\n\nMargaret Henderson Floyd, a historian of Boston architecture (who died in 1997). She\n\ncommented, \"It is quite an accomplishment to have done so much work at such an early\n\nage.\" At that time the age of 39 seemed not so young to me, so I said to her, in so many\n\nwords, \"39 is not *that* young, is it?\" Her response is what I have remembered so well: \"In\n\n89 Ibid.\n90 This approach was, according to Johnston, connected to the \"American context of manual training and shop-\nbased education.\"\n91 Johnston, Drafting Culture.\n\n32\n\n\narchitecture that is young, because in that profession people are entrusting you with a lot of\n\nmoney. They do not like to do this with young people, and this is why many architects don't\n\nreally get traction until they are well into middle age.\" Or again words to this effect. It's the\n\"people entrusting you with a lot of money\" that seemed then and seems now to explain so\n\nmuch about this 'art92.\"'\n\nBut for most academically trained architects the artistic aspirations instilled by the Beaux-Arts system\n\ncame into conflict with the less glamorous reality of practice. Many of them saw that long years of\n\ndraftsmanship in an office were not a guarantee towards professional status as architects, realizing they\n\nwould spend most of their careers as employees of others. Such strongly hierarchical context, which was\n\nfamiliar for engineers, 93 was difficult for architects to accept given the aspirations of individual artistry\n\ninstilled in them during their academic training. As a result, tensions emerged between architects and\n\ndraftsmen who resented the lack of upwards mobility in the profession. The tensions were accentuated in\n\nthe period following the First World War, as all sectors of the US-American economy were under pressure\n\nto incorporate ideas of scientific management into their practices, bringing a key aspect of the 'vartime's\n\nideology into the marketplace.94 While not all in the profession were equally enthusiastic about the\n\nchanges,9 5 the metaphor of the factory and of the military became a common way to think about the\n\narchitecture office. Engineering, often seen by architects as antagonistic to creative work, became a model\n\nfor the architectural office. The incorporation of scientific management ideas into architecture firms\n\nresulted in an increased specialization of its members, which made the social and economic barriers that\n\nprevented draftsmen from becoming architects more difficult to surpass, prompting concerns about the\n\nemployee's alienation.96 The age of the corporate architecture office had begun.97\n\n92 From a private exchange of the author with Rosalind Williams.\n93 For a history of engineering in America see David F. Noble, Forces ofProduction: A Social Histoy ofIndustrial\nAutomation (Oxford University Press, USA, 1986). Also, see: Matthew Wisniosky, \"Engineers and the Intellectual\nCrisis of Technology, 1957-1973\" (Doctoral, Princeton, 2005).\n94Johnston, Drafting Culture, 54.\n95 \"While Hamlin warned against the \"industrialization\" of the architect's office, others seized on the factory and the\nmilitary as paradigms of order for increasing the effectiveness of architectural production.\" Ibid., 59.\n)96 With the gradual transition of architecture from a vocation to a profession the social distance between architect\nand draftsman grew. Drafting and Drawing are linked: to move, to drag (a heavy load, but also a precise instrument).\nIbid., 2.\n97 \"Streamlining tactics included the ordering of business procedures, the specialization of functions within the firm,\nthe weeding out of redundancies, and the elimination of unnecessary motion within the design and drafting\ndepartments.\" Johnston's account of the mentality of this early stage of professional optimization is reminiscent of\nthe ongoing campaign about optimization via BIM. Ibid., 59.\n\n33\n\n\n\"Design\" as a space of power and privilege\n\nNew rhetorical devices played a role in the professional demarcation of architecture: the modern use of\n\nthe word \"design\" appears precisely during this period, as a device for allocating power, and for\n\nestablishing a social and professional hierarchy between architects and draftsmen. While \"designing\" was\n\nconstrued as a creative endeavor, \"drafting\" was construed a \"merely\" technical, or mechanical one. As\n\nJohnston observes:\n\nWhere a paternalistic metaphor had made the draftsman an extension of the\n\narchitect's body, the rhetoric of business organization reduced him to the role of a\n\ncog in a machine. The compartmentalization of roles within the architect's office,\nand the emphasis on increasing efficiency in the drafting room, led to tensions and\n\nfrictions that were difficult to ameliorate through appeals of fellowship and\n\nloyalty. 98\n\nThe organizational reconfigurations of the architectural workplace: the finer subdivision of labor and\n\nthe consolidation of the architect's social role as a provider of drawings, introduced new social and\n\ncognitive distances between the architect and the building site, weakening the \"epistemological link\n\nbetween constructions in the field and the drafting board representations.\" 99 Continuing to nurture artistic\n\naspirations, architectural training almost inevitably focused on draftsmanship and theory, and less on\n\nbuilding. As the twentieth century unrolled, the academic training of architects continued to depart from\n\nthe experiences of a vast majority of practitioners, cultivating an ethos of theoretical and artistic\n\nsophistication unconcerned with the practical realities of building.\n\nBetween managers and artists\n\nThe distinctive flavor the profession acquired in the United States was thus a result of a split\n\nprofessional identity. On one hand the ideological construction of architecture as artistry erected by the\n\nBeaux-Arts training nurtured an image of the architect as a gentleman, a scholar, and an artist. On the\n\nother, the engineering ethos of production and the reality of a competitive marketplace without \"patrons\"\n\n(only \"clients\"), nurtured an image of the architect as a manager and a businessman -and its flipside, a\n\n98 Ibid., 74.\n99 The \"epistemological link\" is, according to architects, enabled by the architect's understanding of the construction\naspects of the drawing beyond mere draftsmanship. A non-linked representation relies on graphism, rather than\nunderstanding. See Ibid., 30. In chapter 5 I explore how architects resort to similar forms of professional\ndemarcation in the world of BIM coordination.\n\n34\n\n\n\"cog\" in a corporate machine.100 For architect and critic Dana Cuff this contradiction plays against\n\narchitects' interests: \"by devaluing the conditions that frame the creative process, a spectrum of\n\nconstraints and opportunities are overlooked and removed from the potential control of the architect.\"101\n\nThe focus of architectural training on artistry pulls future professionals away from the concerns of\n\npractice, creating false expectations and, in many cases, guarantees professional frustration. As Robert\n\nGutman shows, despite the formalization of education and professional associations, architects'\n\nprofessional space and legitimacy remain contested by other professional groups and economic forces\n\nthroughout the second half of the 20th century.102 Larger developing and building contractor companies,\n\ncapable of managing the whole building process, claim areas of expertise traditionally associated with\n\narchitecture, contesting the architect's privileged relationship with the client, as well as his or her control\n\nover building design and construction. 103 In this scenario, the architect's role is reduced -marginalized to\n\nthat of a minor player in whole-packaged works that clients hire directly with a main contractor. 104 The\n\nideological construction of the architect as a gentleman, a scholar, and an artist, mostly unconcerned with\n\nmaterials and labor -a legacy of Alberti's- plays against the struggle to reestablish disciplinary authority\n\nover building production.105\n\nFlash-forward: Gehry's technology\n\nThe Canadian-born US-American architect Frank Gehry has referred to the reduction of the\n\narchitect's responsibilities as a \"terrible scenario for architects,\" in which the architect is \"infantilized\" by\n\nthe contractor.\n\nUntil now, you hired an architect and they designed a building you liked. You\nput it out to bid to contractors and the bid comes in high. You don't have the\nhigh. What do you do? You turn to the contractor, who begins telling you how to\n\n100 For architect Dana Cuff, \"the larger professional project-to achieve unity and standards-was contradicted by\ncurricula intended for personal, non-standardized, artistic development.\" See Cuff, Architecture, 30.\n101 Ibid., 56.\n102 Gutman, Architectural Practice.\n103 See Gehry's \"Organization of the Artist.\"\n104 In a 1998 critical study of the practice in the US Robert Gutman quotes a consultant: \"...increasingly, through\ntheir own actions, architects are running the risk of being treated as design subcontractors. Rather than being the\nspouse, many architects are becoming like the household chef, respected for technical and artistic talents, but\nnevertheless part of the downstairs kitchen staff and paid accordingly.\" See Gutman, Architectural Practice, 78.\n1)5 While practicing architects are well aware of the architecture's collective, negotiated character, popular images of\nthe profession continue to abide by the ideological construction of the architect as an individual force. According to\nLarson, this constitutes a form of bargain, allowing the profession at large to take credit for the accomplishments of a\nfew -and thus sustain a higher social and cultural status. See Larson, Behind the Postmodern Facade.\n\n35\n\n\ncut costs. The contractor becomes parental and [the] architect becomes\n\ninfantilized.10 6\n\nIn Gehry's view, the only way to avoid the infantilization of the architect by the contractor is to fight for\n\nwhat he calls \"the organization of the artist:\" essentially an organizational move placing the architect on\n\ntop of the design and construction hierarchy, giving him supervisory control over the all trades.107\n\nTechnology plays a key role in Gehry's ideal form of practice. Referring to one of his projects, Gehry\n\nstates:\n\nWe were able to build it because computers demystify the complex, so it gives\nyou more freedom. Before we built anything we worked it all out on computers-\n\nuntil we knew exactly what would and wouldn't work and how much it would\ncost. Architects are back in control... 108\n\nEven though he doesn't know how to use one, Gehry sees computers as empowering devices, allowing\n\narchitects to reclaim control over the whole project. In a conversation with Bent Flyvbjerg, Gehry\n\nexplains again the marginalization of the architect, this time with a gender association, invoking the\n\narchitect's marginalization from the project as afeminization.\n\nThere's a tendency to marginalize and treat the creative people like women are\ntreated, 'sweetie, us big business guys know how to do this, just give us the design\nand we'll take it from there.' That is the worst that can happen. It takes the\n\norganization of the artist to prevail so that the end product is as close as possible to\nthe object of desire that both the client and the architect have come to agree\non.10 9\n\nIn Gehry's view, technology -in the form of computer modeling systems- turns the feminized artist\n\ninto a man (a father) again. The 3-D interactive interfaces of Digital Project, Gehry's signature software, are\n\nthe traitsl10 that re-virilize him, giving him power over materials and labor. Computerized building\n\ndescriptions are the written word that brings back to him the full power of the Vitruvian auctoritas.\n\n106 And appealing to the mythical ideal of the Renaissance architect as a master builder. Gehry discusses these\nconcepts in: Sheff, \"Interview: Frank Gehry.\"\n107 This way the \"organization of the artist\" guarantees the architect's ultimate control over design and construction,\npreventing unwanted political, professional or business interests from compromising his artistic vision. For a longer\ndiscussion of Gehry's use of the term see: Bent Flyvbjerg, \"Design by Deception: The Politics of Megaproject\nApproval,\" Haward Design Magazine, no. 22 (2005): 50-59.\n108 Sheff, \"Interview: Frank Gehry.\"\n109 Flyvbjerg, \"Design by Deception.\"\n110 Evans writes about stone-cutting traits in the seventeenth century France as crucial artifacts for the establishment\nof the architect's social role and professional status. Evans, The Projective Cast.\n\n36\n\n\nConclusions\n\nIn Notes on the Underground, Rosalind Williams discusses how the nineteenth century literary imagination\n\nconstrued subterranean environments -the mines, the tunnels- as a social (but also technological and\n\nideological) underworld, intended for the \"less ornamental aspects of society.\"' For academic architects,\n\nheirs to the nineteenth century Beaux-Arts imagination, the worlds of construction and labor are imagined,\n\nsimilarly, as architecture's social and technological underworlds. This chapter has reviewed the\n\nconstruction of this vertical distance through the accounts of historians and scholars of practice,\n\nidentifying the successive devices -the written word, the drawing, the managerial control over trades-\n\nwith which architects have established their professional authority, elevated themselves from the\n\n\"drudgery\" of labor, and claimed access to the spheres of power denied to artisans and workmen.\n\nArchitects in the United States had to struggle to define their own professional legitimacy. Without state\n\npatrons and in a competitive market, they had to negotiate a new professional identity from the conflict\n\nbetween the Beaux-Arts ideological construction of the architect as an artist, and the hierarchical reality of\n\nthe workplace.\n\nThe tensions between US-American draftsmen and architects during the nineteenth and early 20th\n\ncentury, the evolution of the workplace towards larger corporate organizations, and the scientific\n\nmanagerial control over architectural practice 112 -accentuated by the successes of the war effort- shape\n\nthe US-American architectural identity and set the stage where, at the end of the 1960s, computation\n\ncrept into the frame of architecture.'' 3\n\nIII See Rosalind Williams, \"Notes on the Underground, New Edition: An Essay on Technology, Society, and the\nImagination\" (April 30, 2008), http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?tid=11 4 20&ttype=2.\n12 Systematization precedes computation.\n11 With Ghirardo, Cuff, and Larson, I adopt the critical view that architecture is a culturally situated and\nheteronomous (as opposed to autonomous) practice that is better understood in relation to its cultural, social and\nprofessional contexts.\n\n37\n\n\n3. A TECHNOLOGICAL IMAGINATION OF DESIGN:\n\nTHE COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN PROJECT (1959-1967)\n\nIntroduction\n\nOutline\n\nDuring the post-war era, MIT engineers re-imagined design in the language of the machine. This\n\nchapter identifies and documents their \"technological imagination of design,\" focusing on the discourses\n\nof design and design representation emerging around the culture of technology production developing\n\naround the Computer-Aided Design Project, a research operation funded by the US Air Force, active between\n\n1959 and 1967, at MIT.\n\nI will structure my analysis around three related threads. First I will show how, inspired by the dictates\n\nof the new science of cybernetics, the engineers in the project re-imagined design as the iterative\n\nperformance of a problem-solving \"man-machine\" engine. Second, I will show how, by encoding\n\ncenturies-old mathematical methods about perspective drawing in the computer, the engineers of the\n\nProject reconfigured design representation as the structured combination, in the computer, of Albertian\n\nperspectivalism and data processing. Third, I will examine the politics of representation, participation and\n\nauthorship in their discourses about design. In particular, I will critically consider the tropes of neutrality\n\nand universality characterizing technology in design, arguing that they constitute the seminal discursive\n\nplatform for contemporary design technologies and processes. I will show how, in these early discourses of\n\ndesign, technological systems are conceived of as \"perfect slaves,\" becoming neutral vessels for design, and\n\nexerted influence beyond the boundaries of the project, having an immediate effect on the disciplines of\n\narchitecture and urban studies at MIT.\n\nTo illustrate this, I will conclude the chapter by critically examining how the young Nicholas\n\nNegroponte, then a young researcher at the MIT School of Architecture and Planning, interpreted the\n\nProject's theoretical and technological propositions to re-imagine architectural and planning practice. In\n\n38\n\n\nmy analysis, I critically consider the politics of representation, participation and authorship in his early\n\nworks, and assess its efficacy as an architectural and cultural critique.' 14\n\nMIT Context\n\nDuring the post-war age MIT received more Federal funds for research than any other academic\n\ninstitution, and became the epicenter of a vibrant culture of research and development which derived in\n\nadvances such as sensors, actuators, cathodic-ray tube monitors and computer graphics.\"5 During this\n\nperiod, computers were still unique, expensive artifacts that only an academic and government elite could\n\naccess. However, the notion of widespread personal computing was already part of the US-American\n\npopular imagination, fueled in part by the awe-inspiring wartime advances in electronics and by the\n\ncontemporary promotion of technology and automation as patriotic endeavors.16 Within this context of\n\ntechnological optimism, the Computer-AidedDesign Project was funded through three consecutive contracts\n\nbetween the US Air Force and the Electronics Systems Laboratory and the Design and Graphics Division\n\nat the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering' 'n with the aim of improving design and manufacture\n\nof missiles, airplanes and their components for the US Air Force. The Project's leader, Douglas T. Ross,' 18\n\nsynthesized this objective in an internal report with a blunt \"MORE AIRFORCE PER DOLLAR,\"119\n\nproviding a powerful illustration of the militaristic roots of the effort. 2 0\n\n114 I have published earlier versions of this chapter.

During the second contractual stage, the Project invited participants from\n\nthe aircraft and weapons industries. The new contingent included programmers from Boeing, IBM,\n\nLockheed-Georgia Company and the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp. The programmers moved to\n\nMIT via a transfer agreement between MIT and their employers in March of 1963. They were assigned\n\nto collaborate with the Project's MIT researchers for one year. Their aim was to finish the \"first phase\" of\n\nresearch: the programming language and compiler AED- 1, which would serve as the stem from which the\n\nfirst Computer-Aided Design system would \"evolve.\" This -they hoped- would be the first step in the\n\ntransference of knowledge from MIT into the industry. The importance of this transfer was stressed as a\n\n\"bi-directional link\" with \"real-world\" problems in the original invitation note sent to the companies:\n\nIt is the firm objective of the Computer-Aided Design Project to provide a\nsignificantly new design technology which, following the successful traditions of\nthe numerical control and APT System technologies, will be of direct benefit to\nthe [US] American industry.121\n\nThe Project's leaders hoped to promote interest among members of industry to develop more specialized\n\nComputer-Aided Design applications, and therefore connect the Project's academic research with \"real\"\n\nproblems. To accomplish this, the AED Cooperative Program was established in 1964.122 It consisted of\n\none-year fellowships intended to bring members of industry into MIT as a mechanism to promote the\n\nappreciation and diffusion of the technologies and ideas developed in the Project.123 By fostering\n\npartnerships between academic research and companies, Air-Force sponsored programs like the Computer-\n\nAided Design Project sought to plant seeds of innovation in the United States' industry.124 In a 1965 report,\n\nthe AED Program is described as \"a successful blending of Air Force, industry, and academic interests.\"1 25\n\n121 Ibid., 3\n122 AED stands for \"Automated Engineering Design.\" See Douglas T.

Today DARPA funds education\n\n40\n\n\nProject CAD and Project MAC126\n\nSince 1963 the Computer-Aided Design Project was framed within a larger inter-departmental initiative\n\ncalled Project MAC, funded by ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) through Office of Naval\n\nResearch. MAC's goal was to \"develop and foster man-machine problem-solving\" 127 through time-shared\n\ncomputation, specifically by having a community of users connected to a computer through remote\n\nconsoles, developing Interactive applications and problem-oriented programming languages. Project MA C\n\nemerged from the convergence of war-time efforts in graphic interfaces such as the SAGE,128 the\n\nElectronic Systems Labs (which in 1950 had developed the first numerically controlled mill, operated with\n\npunched cards129) and the accumulated knowledge about time-shared30 computing from the Timesharing\n\nproject.131 The Project MA C was planned around the IBM 7094 machine, a state of the art computer to\n\nwhich around 100 people on the MIT campus -including the researchers at the Computer-Aided Design\n\nProject- had access to it through remote ESL consoles. Project AA C was a cross-disciplinary research\n\nendeavor, crucial to the establishment of MIT as a world center of computer science. For the purposes of\n\nmy analysis it is worth noting how the Coniputer-Aided Design Project preceded Project MA C, and is in fact one\n\nof its institutional origins. With Timesharing, Computer-Aided Design was at the root of MIT's history of\n\npost-war sponsored research that converged in Project MA C, resulting in the foundation of the MIT\n\nLaboratory of Computer Science in 1975,132 the predecessor to MIT's quasi-legendary Course 6.13s [See\n\nFigure 1]\n\ninitiatives premised on \"creative\" hackers.

This was key in lowering the costs of computation. Time-shared computing was the\ndominant way of computing during the 1970s.\n1 Jack Belzer, Albert G.

Rather than developing specialized applications or routines to\n\nsolve particular \"problems,\"134 (i.e. applications for the design of missiles, or aircraft) they sought to define\n\na theory of design premised on the notions of design as man-machine problem-solving,135 and of the\n\ncomputer as a universal representation machine. Their goal was to define a system general enough that it\n\ncould be used to represent and compute elements of any field of application, such as \"geometry, materials,\n\naerodynamics, thermodynamics and even aesthetics\"1 36 in a language of discrete entities. In the following\n\nexcerpt, the Project's leader Douglas T. Ross, nicely captures this aspiration of generality.\n\nFrom the Computer Applications point of view the primary problem is not how\n\nto solve the problems, but how to state them.13 7\n\nA considerable effort was thus put into the definition of a general theory of abstraction intended to\n\nsupport the development of problem-oriented programming languages. An illustration of such theory of\n\nabstraction is the plex, a theoretical construct Ross defined as \"an interweaved combination of parts in a\n\nstructure... [with the purpose of representing a] thing, be it concrete or abstract, physical of\n\nconceptual.\"1 38 In its more detailed definition, Ross describe the plex as the combination of three key\n\ncomponents: data, structure and algorithm. The data are \"units or indivisible entities in terms of which the\n\n'thing's' properties are described or measured.\"139 The structure refers to the relationships between the\n\ndata, and the algorithm is \"the capstone that allows the data in the structure to be interpreted, manipulated\n\nand filled with meaning.\"140 The algorithm relates to the behavior and the interpretation of the whole: a\n\n134 The engineers understood design as \"problem-solving.\" Douglas Taylor Ross, Computer-aided Design: a Statement of\nObjectives (M.I.T. Electronic Systems Laboratory, 1960).\n135 \"We have claimed that there is no distinction between computer-aided design and man-machine problem\nsolving. Design is a special term for some ill-defined type of problem solving, but no special features are reflected in a\nsystem for design versus a system for general problem-solving.\" Ross, \"The AED Approach to Generalized\nComputer-aided Design,\" 2.\n136 Ross, Investigations in Computer-Aided Designfor Numericaly Controlled Production., 8.

With the plex, Ross and the engineers behind the\n\nComputer-Aided Design Project sought to create a general theory of representation for describing (and\n\ncomputing solutions to) any problem. Whether the artifact to be designed was a servomechanism or a\n\nhouse, the plex was imagined as the multi-purpose representation instrument. To represent a line, for\n\nexample, a plex entity had to be defined which contained sub-entities for its starting and ending points;\n\neach point sub-entity would in turn contain values for its x andy coordinates. Another sub-entity would\n\ndescribe the line itself, as an element with pointers to the other 2 sub-entities.141\n\nBeyond representation, the modeling universe imagined with the plex provided also an interpretive\n\napparatus (in the form of a processing algorithm) to transform the user's verbal or graphic representations\n\ninto internal models with which the system could compute. The system was thus imagined as a self-\n\nconsistent universe of interacting \"meanings,\" with its own laws and logic, opaque to an external observer:\n\na black box.14 2 The following quote, from a paper entitled \"Theoretical Foundations for the Computer-\n\nAided Design System,\" illustrates these notions of self-containment and opacity.\n\nSince the entire process is based ultimately upon the interactions between the\nmeanings of the many elements involved, and since the sorting out of what things\ngo together is handled automatically by the \"natural laws\" of behavior which are\nbuilt in, the designer on the outside has no conception of the chaotic activity\ninside the system, but sees only external effects appropriate to his mode of\nunderstanding.14 3\n\nThe plex illustrates the Project's commitment to the development of a computational theory of\n\nabstraction premised on the notion of design as problem-solving. The engineers leading the Project sought\n\nto ground this theory by developing problem-oriented programming languages (such as the AED-0 and\n\nAED-1). Crucially for my analysis, the plex theory exposes a theoretical commitment by the Computer-Aided\n\nDesign Project leaders to the idea that computational descriptions, because of their capacity to index\n\n\"semantic\" content, bear structural resemblances with the artifacts they are meant to depict.144 In what\n\nComputer-Aided Design for Numerically Controlled Production.Ross, Investigations in Computer-Aided Designfor\nNumerically Controlled Production.\n141 The dissociation between data, structure and algorithm, explicit in the plex, is in a way essential for the\nprogramming of graphic representation systems. From this perspective, the plex theory suggests the imminent\nappearance of object-oriented programming. Sutherland's programming of the Sketchpad is often considered the first\nexample of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n142 In scientific fields, the expression \"black box\" refers to a system whose workings are opaque to an observer. In\ncomputation it's a common expression used to refer to aspects of a system that are beyond reach of a user.\n143 Douglas T. Ross and Jorge E. Rodriguez, \"Theoretical Foundations for the Computer-aided Design System,\" in\nProceedings ofthe May 21-23, 1963, Spring Joint Computer Conference, AFIPS '63 (Spring) (New York, NY, USA: ACM,\n1963), 318, http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1461551.1461589.\n144 One of the tenets of this assumption (related to fabrication technologies) is the idea of symbolic manipulation and\nrepresentation as plans preceding and prescribing material action.\n\n43\n\n\nfollows, I discuss how the encoding of perspective geometry in the computer enabled the Project's engineers\n\nto widen their claims about the structuredness of digital representations and about the universality of the\n\ncomputer as a representation machine, effectively configuring a new kind of epistemological link between\n\nrepresentation and object. [Figure 2]\n\nReconfiguring design representation: Roberts and the perspective hack\n\nDuring the fifteenth century, architects like Filippo Brunelleschi and Gian Battesti Alberti helped\n\nestablish the graphical methods of perspective drawing that enabled artists and architects to represent\n\nthree-dimensional space in the two-dimensional space of the plane with perceptual accuracy. In the early\n\ndays of the computer age, MIT engineers had to re-discover these mathematical methods in order to build\n\nthem into the new language of the computer.\n\nLarry Roberts,145 who as a Masters and Ph.D. student in electrical engineering worked on the TX-0\n\nand TX-2 computers at MIT during the early 1960s,146 was the first to create a computer program able to\n\ndisplay a three-dimensional object in perspective, from different angles. To accomplish this, he translated\n\nthe graphical and mathematical methods of perspective into the binary language of the computer.147 For\n\nhis doctoral thesis, Robert's worked on a computer program that could interpret a 3-D shape from a\n\nphotograph of a planar solid.148 To accomplish this, Roberts pioneered some of the first \"computer\n\nvision\" methods for parsing a digital reconstruction of a solid's photograph, but faced the challenge of\n\ngenerating a description of the 3-D element from any given point. Unable to find a precedent, Roberts\n\n\"hacked\" a solution by studying and combining two separate bodies of literature: mathematical methods\n\nfor perspective geometry, from German textbooks from the 1800s, and the (more conventional)\n\nknowledge about matrices. 149\n\nIt turned out there was no technology in the U.S. or in the world at that point\nin time integrating both matrices and perspective geometry. Somehow the two\nhad been totally separated in time and space throughout the world. So I went\nback to the German textbooks and found out how perspective geometry was done\n\n145 Roberts had a leading role in developing the ARPANET, an early predecessor to the Internet. His most famous\ncontribution was the idea of packet switching, a technology for data transmission fundamental to computer\nnetworks.\n146 Roberts recalls he logged more than 600 hours in the TX-0 machine, an \"astronomical amount of time to be able\nto spend personally on one of those machines in that era.\" SIGGRAPH '89: A CA SIGGRAPH 89 Panel Proceedings\n(New York, NY, USA: ACM, 1989), 56.\n147 Roberts is responsible for developing the first algorithm for eliminating the lines of the hidden faces of a 3-D\nobject.. At 29 Roberts was appointed as Arpanet's architect, and was key in the world's first computer network.\n148 This was the subject of his thesis: Lawrence G. Roberts and Peter Elias, \"Machine perception of three-\ndimensional solids\" (Ph.D., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1963).\n149 Ibid.\n\n44\n\n\nand that [these books] had no knowledge of matrices, of course, and put the two\ntogether and created the four-dimensional homogeneous coordinate transform,\nwhich is widely used today for perspective transformations. 50\n\nThe result of this hack was the four-dimensional transform with which Roberts was able to encode1 51\n\nthe homogeneous coordinates of perspective geometry in matrix form. The method allowed him to\n\nvisualize a 3-D object from any given \"camera\" point, on the computer screen. Roberts recalls his work\n\nduring this time in a modest and somehow playful way.\n\nThe homogeneous coordinates in matrix form was [sic] my invention. The\nconcept, the word homogeneous came from the 1800s, in terms of their handling\nof perspective geometry, but again it was all in terms of individual equations and\nnot in matrix. So throughout this whole period we were picking up old things that\npeople had done... and applying it to the real world... We were picking up math\nand applying it, and it was certainly new in the computer field but it wasn't new in\nperspective geometry.15 2\n\nBy \"hacking into\" perspective mathematics from the 1800s German textbooks, and putting it in terms\n\nof matrix operations, Roberts encoded the Renaissance perspectival vision in the computer. His\n\ncontribution establishes the foundations of the distinctive representational tradition of our age: a hybrid of\n\nAlbertian perspectivalism and data processing.153 The emergence of this tradition gave support to\n\ntechnologists' aspirations about the universality of the computer as a representation machine. This\n\nreconfigured notion of representation led the engineers in The Project to re-imagine different forms of\n\ndesign practice, endowing them with a new sense of materiality and structure [See Figures 3 and 4].\n\nThe Project's engineers imagined computerized descriptions as fundamentally distinct from paper\n\ndrawings. Unlike paper drawings, computerized descriptions were structured combinations of different\n\nkinds of data, making it possible for a geometric representation to index information about non-geometric\n\naspects of a design. In this they saw a distinct quality, and an opportunity to re-imagine design practices.\n\nIn a paper entitled \"Outline of the Requirements for a Computer-Aided Design System\"154 Steven A.\n\nCoons -a professor of Mechanical Engineering and leader, with Ross, of the CAD Project 55- writes that\n\n150 SIGGRAPH '89.\n151 Roberts's move was permitted by the fact that perspective geometry was already a structured, mathematized form\nof reprsentation, prior to its mechanization and automation via computation. The word \"encoding\" evokes the\nprocessing of data through computer code, but also the \"codification\" of practice observed by Giedion to precede\nmechanization. Siegfried Giedion, Iechanization Takes Command: A Contribution to Anonymous History (W. W. Norton &\nCompany, 1969).\n152 SIGGRAPH '89.\n5'3 Roberts claims to have coined the phrase \"computational geometry\" in 1970.\n\n154 Steven Anson Coons, An Outline of the Requirementsfor a Computer-Aided Design System, M.I.T. Electronic Systems\nLaboratory. Technical Memorandum ESL-TM-169 (Cambridge: M.I.T. Electronic Systems Laboratory, 1963).\n\n45\n\n\n\"in the design process the designer is concerned with a large set of variables,\" some of which he describes\n\nas \"continuous, like the weight of a certain part,\" and some as \"discrete 'point sets' (like material: steel,\n\nbrass, lead, plastic).\" Coons saw that abstract representations in the computer could be used to create\n\nassociations between the variables, which could be \"interrelated, or cross-coupled, in a very complex\n\nway.\" 5 s Coons thus transforms the designer's engagement with the representation and the\n\nepistemological link between representation and object.157\n\nCoons's student, Ivan Sutherland,158 gives insight into these reconfigurations. He saw the production of\n\ncomputerized descriptions as \"an entirely different activity\" from traditional drafting, more akin to\n\nprogramming than to hand drawing because of the structured nature of computer code. 5\n9 In Sutherland's\n\ntelling description of drafting, pencils or ink on paper are only capable of making \"dirty marks on\n\npaper:\"1 0\n\nAn ordinary draftsman is unconcerned with the structure of his drawing\n\nmaterial. Pen and ink or pencil and paper have no inherent structure. They only\n\nmake dirty marks on paper. The draftsman is concerned principally with the\n\ndrawings as a representation of the evolving design.161\n\nSutherland's \"ordinary draftsman\" is solely concerned with the correspondence, or resemblance, of the\n\ndrawing with the physical artifact it describes; this correspondence is posited as a disadvantage.\" 2 But\n\n155 He was also the director of the Design and Graphics division in the Mechanical Engineering Department at MIT.\n156 Coons, An Outline of the Requirementsfor a Computer-Aided Design System.\n157 It's worth noticing that Coons was an expert in graphic representation, and co-authored an extensive manual of\nengineering graphic standards and draftsmanship. John T Rule, Graphics (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1961).\n158 As a graduate student in Electrical Engineering at MIT, under Professor Coons's supervision, Ivan Sutherland\ndeveloped the first interactive computer graphics system, the Sketchpad, in 1963. The Sketchpad is conventionally\nconsidered as the first interactive graphic system, and thus the origin of Computer graphics and CAD.\n15 As context, Ina Wagner and Hilda Tellioglu provide a useful discussion of the distinctive forms of work involved\nin software development, where a great amount of effort goes into defining infrastructures for collaboration,\ncommon interfaces, and modules that comprise the software's architecture. In their study, a team of programmers in\na particular project would devote time to specify coding styles and \"on making sure the structure of the program as\nwell as the composition of each module was understood by all.\" Technological compatibility is also a primary\nconcern. The cost for a system to pay no attention to these concerns would be to be left out of a global market of\nsoftware goods.\" This is the ethos thinkers like Sutherland imagined for the production of design descriptions. Hilda\nTellioglu and Ina Wagner, \"Software Cultures,\" Commun. ACM 42, no. 12 (December 1999): 71-77.\n160 Ivan Sutherland, \"Structure in Drawing and the Hidden-Surface Problem,\" in Reflections on Computer Aids to Design\nand Architecture, ed. Nicholas Negroponte (New York, 1975), 73-77 (excerpt not including the \"hidden surface\nproblem.\"\n161 Ibid.\n162 Sutherland's description of a draftsman unconcerned with the structure of the drawing may not be an entirely\naccurate observation. Histories of draftsmanship represent a different reality, of an extremely structured and\nregimented practice (See Chapter 2, in particular the review ofJohnston, Drafting Culture.). On the other hand,\nperspective drawing was already a mathematized form of spatial description. For an illustration of this, see Latour's\ndiscussion of Booker's observation that linear perspective progressively \"changed the concept of pictures from being\njust representation to that of being projections onto planes.\" See Bruno Latour, \"Visualisation and Cognition:\n\n46\n\n\nwhat concerns us here is that Sutherland posits the newly found structured character of computer-\n\ngenerated descriptions to be an argument for a topological resemblance -already present in the plex\n\ntheory- between the act of producing a computational drawing and a physical artifact. This led him to\n\nposit that creating descriptions with a computer was the work of an engineer, not a draftsman. Sutherland\n\nbelieved that the crucial challenge for the new emerging culture of computational design was to not think\n\nof computer-generated graphics as \"drawings of a design,\" but instead as a computerized descriptions that\n\nare built instead of drawn: essential to this view was the idea that computer-generated descriptions of\n\nbuildings are not \"drawings,\" but a sort of \"constructs\" with a materiality and structure of their own -a\n\nnew kind of representational artifact with the potential to enable a designer to link different kinds of\n\ninformation, with geometry, to describe a building.s63\n\nAs soon as the process of computer-aided design is considered as building a\ncomputerized description of the object being designed, rather than as the process\nof drawing the object being designed, horizons become tremendously expanded.\nIn the architectural world, for example, one should think of computer-aided\ndesign as producing not only graphical outputs but also material lists; labor\nestimates; floor area computations; heating, lighting, and ventilation simulations\n(to demonstrate de adequacy of the design); as well as many other auxiliary\noutputs. Only when the computerized version of the design is the master\ndocument from which all auxiliary information is derived, preferably with\ncomputer assistance, will a complete computer-aided design system have been\ncreated. 164\n\nSutherland was also aware of the re-organization of work the new form of representation suggested [See\n\nFigure 5]. Before networked computing was the dominant paradigm of computation, he contended that a\n\n\"computer-design system can provide a communications mechanism between a multitude of users and\n\nthus reduce the cost of design jobs that are too big for one person\"16 5 thus anticipating a key Building\n\nInfornation Modeling theme. Morover, Sutherland's theory of difference between the engineer and the\n\ndraftsman shows how the reconfiguration of practice latent in their discourses had a disciplinary\n\ndimension: machines and software are imagined as constitutive of boundaries between professional\n\ngroups.\n\nThe engineers' construction of design representations as forms of building outlined a way of thinking\n\nabout design as a structured process of information management, and enabled them to speculate about\n\nDrawing Things Together,\" in Knowlegde and Society: Studies in the Sociology of Culture Past and Present, vol. 6 (Jai Press,\nn.d.), 25.\n13 This ideas resonate with present-day definitions of Building Information Modeling and \"concurrent design. See,\nfor instance, Witt, \"Concurrent Design.\"\n164 Sutherland, \"Structure in Drawing and the Hidden-Surface Problem,\" 76.\n15 Ibid.\n\n47\n\n\nnew forms of division of labor. In what follows I discuss how ideas about work are reconfigured in the\n\nProject's discourses of design.\n\nReconfiguring work: Steven Coons's Perfect Slaves\n\nBesides the development of programming languages and abstract structures like the plex, the Project's\n\nleaders also saw in computers an opportunity to theorize new forms of division of labor in design. Inspired\n\nin the discourses of cybernetics166 that construed human-machine interaction as a symbiosis between two\n\norganisms, the Project's engineers re-imagined the designer's role in relation to what were perceived as the\n\nmachine's capacities. In their cybernetic theory of design, the Project engineers assigned complementary\n\nroles to each part of the human-machine assemblage, defining the boundaries of what constitutes\n\ncreativity and work.167\n\nDuring his participation in the Project as leader of the Design and Graphics team, Coons made crucial\n\ntheoretical and technical contributions to the emerging fields of Computer-Aided Design and Computer\n\nGraphics [See Figure 6]. He was also an ardent promoter of computational design and manufacture\n\nmethods across fields.'1 8 One of his crucial contributions was the development of mathematical techniques\n\nfor describing three-dimensional curved surfaces (he called them \"patches\"), first by the definition of\n\nmethods for the non-parametric interpolation of a patch between four edge curves, and then through the\n\ndefinition of parametric methods based on a set of polynomials.16 9 As a professor of mechanical\n\nengineering, Coons led crucial developments in computer graphics and computer aided manufacturing.\n\nFor instance, he oversaw the first interactive computer graphics display, the Sketchpad, developed by his\n\nstudent, Ivan Sutherland, under his supervision.170\n\n166 A particularly influential paper for members of the Project was:J.C.R. Licklider, \"Man-Computer Symbiosis\",\n1960, http://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html. Cybernetics was then a new scientific field\nseeking to use the formalisms and analytical framework of Shannon's Information Theory for the representation and\ncontrol of (biological, mathematical, social, mechanical) systems as flows of messages, and feedback loops. The\ninfluential Information Theory was first formulated for telephonic communications in: Claude E Shannon and\nWarren Weaver, The Alathematical Theory of Communication (University of Illinois Press, 1998). Cybernetics was\nformulated by Norbert Wiener in Norbert Wiener, Cybernetics, Second Edition: Or the Control and Communication in the\nAnimal and the Machine, second ed. (The MIT Press, 1965).\n167 Ross, the Project's leader, explains: \"The synergetic integration of the creative abilities of the human with the\nimmense capacity of hardware and software in the computer, in a man-machine problem-solving team Ross,\nInvestigations in Computer-Aided Design for Numerically Controlled Production.\n168 Coons was an enthusiastic advocate for the use of computers in art, architecture and design. See, for instance,\nCoons, \"Computer, Art & Architecture.\"\n169 These methods are, still today, the foundation of commercial software surface representation algorithms.\n170 See \"Sketchpad: A man-machine graphical communication system\" (Ph.D. Diss., Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, 1963).\n\n48\n\n\nCrucially for my analysis, Coons conceived design as an iterative process of representation and analysis\n\nwhere a \"creative stage\", in which a design representation is created, is followed by a \"mechanical stage,\"\n\nin which the representation is tested against different metrics such as mechanical stress and overall\n\nstructural performance. Coons believed that the \"creative stage\" was better suited for human designers\n\nwhile the \"mechanical stage\" could be successfully automated.m17 This view was one of the theories\n\nguiding the Project's technical efforts. In an Electronic Systems Laboratory technical memorandum from\n\n1963, entitled \"Requirements for a Computer-Aided Design System,\" Coons imagines CAD in cybernetic\n\nlanguage as a system joining \"man and machine\" in an \"intimate cooperative complex, a combination\n\nthat would use the creative and imaginative powers of the man and the analytical and computational\n\npowers of the machine each with the greatest possible economy and efficiency.\"' 72\n\nThe human-machine relationship formulated in this statement -and adopted by the Project at large-\n\nevoked the cybernetic idea of symbiotic assemblages of machine and human as a single organism.\n\nThrough the cybernetic lens, Coons and the Computer-Aided Design Project envisioned design as an iterative\n\nprocess of machine-enhanced representation and analysis, and machine-driven manufacture:\n\nThe different powers of man and machine are complementary powers, cross-\nfertilizing powers, mutually re-enforcing powers. It is becoming increasingly clear\nthat the combined intellectual potential of man and machine is greater than the\nsum of its parts.7 3\n\nCoons's characterization of human-machine difference suggests a clear power hierarchy where\n\ncomputers are slaves with humans as their masters. Design is thus imagined as a cybernetic feedback loop\n\nbetween representation, analysis and materialization, where a \"creative moment\" -during which a\n\ndesign representation is created- is followed by a \"mechanical moment\" -during which the\n\nrepresentations are evaluated in the light of different metrics- such as resistance to tension, compression,\n\nand overall structural performance. Crucially, Coons 7 4 believed that the \"creative moment\" was better\n\nsuited for the human designers, while the \"mechanical moment,\" consisting of analytical, material and\n\nnumerical aspects, could be successfully automated.\n\nWe envisioned even then the designer seated at a console, drawing a sketch of\nhis proposed device on the screen of an oscilloscope tube with a \"light pen,\"\n\n171 About the testing stage Coons wrote: \"These are all essentially mechanical operations, however, and it is quite\nclear that at least in principle, the computer can be made to deal with all of them.\" Steven A. Coons, \"An Outline of\nthe Requirements for a Computer-Aided Design System,\" In Spring Joint Computer Conference, Detroit, Aichigan (New\nYork: ACM, 1963), 301.\n172 Coons, An Outline of the Requirementsfor a Computer-Aided Design System, 300.\nm7 Ibid.\n\n\"4 And his colleagues at the Computer-Aided Design Project.\n\n49\n\n\nmodifying his sketch at will, and commanding the computer slave to refine the\n\nsketch into a perfect drawing, to perform various numerical analyses having to do\nwith structural strength, clearances of adjacent parts, and other analyses as well.175\n\nCoons's imagination of design illustrates the influence of cybernetic discourses in the Project's theories\n\nabout Computer-Aided Design. Moreover, it reveals how the conceptions of creativity, design, and work,\n\nare established, re-organized and re-configured, in the Project's discourses, in relation to their place in a\n\ntechnological framework. From this point on, an epistemological shift occurs: technology can no longer be\n\nunderstood as a tool for design, but as its infrastructure.1761 I will now consider how one of Steven A. Coons's\n\nstudents, the then young architect Nicholas Negroponte, adopted the Project's technical and theoretical\n\nidioms to re-imagine architecture and planning.\n\nThe architect and the machine: Nicholas Negroponte and the\n\nComputer-Aided Design Project\"'\n\n\"Perfect slaves\" and \"mechanical partners\"\n\nToday, Nicholas Negroponte is mostly known for his work as chairman of the One Laptop Per Child\n\n(OLPC) foundation, a global non-profit endeavor seeking to provide poor children with small laptops,\n\npromoting computers as crucial vehicles for individual and collective self-education. However, the fact\n\nthat Negroponte's techno-cultural entrepreneurship originated in the arena of Computer-Aided Design is far\n\nless known.\n\nIn the spring of 1966, when the Computer-Aided Design Project was in its most intense phase of\n\ndevelopment, Negroponte -then a Masters of Architecture student at MIT- attended Steven A.\n\nCoons's course \"Computer-Aided Design.\" In his notes, Negroponte described the class as a \"study of\n\nman-machine synthesis via graphical intercourse.\" 78 The class was structured around Coons's own\n\nmethodl 79 for describing and manipulating three-dimensional geometric elements in the computer, 80 and\n\n'm Ibid.\n171 This theme is developed in more detail in chapters 6 and 7 in regards to the Building Information Modeling\nproject.\n17 This section draws from my earlier article Cardoso Llach, \"Inertia of an Automated Utopia: Design Commodities\nand Authorial Agency 40 Years After the Architecture Machine.\"\n178 Nicholas Peter Negroponte, \"The Computer Simulation of Perception During Motion in the Urban\nEnvironment.\" (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1966), 99,\nhttp://dspace.mit.edu.libproxy.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/13288.\n179 Succinctly known the \"Coons method.\"\n1 3 Negroponte, \"The Computer Simulation of Perception During Motion in the Urban Environment.\"\n\n50\n\n\nthe matrix transformations for perspective projection first developed by Roberts. The course was\n\ninfluential to Negroponte, who became one of Coons's advisees, and wrote a thesis where he contended\n\nthat computers could be thought of as machines for \"simulating perception.\"181 After graduating,\n\nNegroponte sought to expand the influence of the advancements in computer research by the CAD Project\n\ninto the fields of architecture and urban planning -now as a young professor and researcher at the MIT\n\nSchool of Architecture and Planning, through his research lab \"Architecture Machine\" [See Figure 8].\n\nIn this section, I focus my analysis on the collection of research projects and theoretical propositions in\n\nNegroponte's 1970 book The Architecture Machine, placing it within the theoretical and technological\n\nframework developed by the Computer-AidedDesign Project, illustrating the Project's reach beyond the\n\ndepartmental and disciplinary boundaries. While an array of fields celebrates The Architecture Machine's\n\npioneering enunciation of key human-machine interaction paradigms, including gestural and windows-\n\nbased interfaces, I'd like to situate it in the intellectual context of technology production at MIT,\n\ninterrogating its ambition to use technology as a vehicle of social -and architectural- critique. In\n\nparticular, I critically approach The Architecture Machine's socio-technical utopia where architectural\n\npractice is imagined as a playful, democratizing conversation between humans and machines.18 2\n\nHuman-Machine Encounters: \"Ted, many conflicts are occurring\"\n\nLet us build machines that can learn, can grope, and can fumble, machines that\n\nwill be architectural partners, architecture machines. 8 3\n\n181 Ibid.\n132 Negroponte and the other proponents of The Architecture Machine at MIT were not alone in their pursuit.\nInformation theory and computers played an important role in the imagination of architects at the time. Among\nthose ideologically close to Negroponte and the Architecture Machine Group was Hungarian-born French architect\nYona Friedman. Negroponte met Friedman in 1964 while still a graduate student when he was asked to serve as\nFriedman's interpreter in the US. They eventually became collaborators and, in his foreword for Friedman's book,\nNegroponte acknowledged the commonalities between their projects. The theme of a technologically enabled\nparticipatory architecture was at the center of Friedman's Towards a Scientific Architecture, a speculative piece that\nadvocated a \"direct feedback\" between the user and an architectural \"expert system\" for the production of designs.\nIn his book, Friedman pejoratively labeled the architect as an elitist \"middleman\" to be bypassed in order to liberate\nthe dweller (branded here as \"user\") from the assumptions of the professional designer. Like Negroponte, Friedman\nused information-theoretical idioms for articulating what he conceived of as a more \"scientific\" design process.\nFriedman states, for instance, \"epistemology is essentially information theory in disguise.\" See Yona Friedman,\nToward a Scientific Architecture, trans. Cynthia Lang (The MIT Press, 1980), 6. For a very rich source of reference on\nthe influence of cybernetics and information theory in architectural discourse in Great Britain during the 1960's see\nUpitis, \"Nature Normative.\" The observation of Negroponte and Friedman's ideological commonalities can be\nfound in Robert Bruegmann, \"The Pencil and the Electronic Sketchpad: Architectural Representation and the\nComputer,\" in Architecture and Its Image, ed. Eve Blau and Ned Kaufman, Catalog of Inaugural Show at Canadian\nCenter for Architecture (Montreal, 1989).\n1 [ Nicholas Negroponte, The Architecture Mfachine: Toward a More Human Environment (The MIT Press, 1973), 12 1.\n\n51\n\n\nInstead of presenting a single artifact, as its title suggests, The Architecture Machine introduces a collection\n\nof different scenarios and experiments. Throughout the book, two main themes are developed. The first\n\nexplores computers are thought of as artificial experts guiding the dweller through design choices until a\n\nunique and optimal residential solution is reached -a sort of architectural version of an \"expert\n\nsystem.\"1 84 The second posits a computer network as a communication platform between a community\n\nand a human designer. Under this premise, the network's central processor interprets the community's\n\npreferences into clear spatial guidelines to be followed by a human architect, thus penetrating \"the\n\ndesigner-dweller dissonance that exists in today's housing problem.\"185 Both themes position technology as\n\na vehicle to bypass architects and planners, professionals Negroponte saw as elitist middlemen standing\n\nbetween the \"people\" and good design.186\n\nAs a proof of concept for the first (the \"expert system\") category, Negroponte presents URBAN5, a\n\ncomputer-aided design system comprising a cathode-ray tube monitor, a keyboard, an optic pen, and a\n\nsmall console with several controls -including a \"PANIC\" button. The system receives text commands\n\nfrom the user as inputs and interprets them as geometric and spatial constraints, calculates a response to\n\nthe inputs, and displays it on the cathode-ray tube monitor as compositions of three-dimensional cubes.187\n\nIf the program cannot adequately match the input to a response it requests further specification from the\n\nuser; in case of conflicting constraints, URBAN5 displays gentle alerts on the screen. The stated aim of\n\nURBAN5 is to test the desirability of natural language as a communication medium between humans and\n\nmachines [See Figures 9 and 10]. 188 However, URBAN5 did not fulfill their makers' expectations because\n\nof its inability to enact what they thought were the attributes of a truly adaptable architecture machine:\n\nPlaying is learning, but URBAN5 has not been sufficiently sophisticated\nactually to frolic; instead it has inexhaustibly printed garbage [...] URBAN5\n\n184 Expert systems are a type of computer program that is supposed to perform a human expert's task. Such systems\nare founded on the notion of \"knowledge capture:\" the idea that a \"knowledge engineer\" can study and encode in a\ncomputer program the decision-making process and expertise of a human subject. For a sharp perspective on the\nculture of \"knowledge engineering\" and artificial intelligence see Diana Forsythe and DavidJ. Hess, Studying hose\nWho Study Us: an anthropologist in the world of artificial intelligence (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001).\n185 Negroponte, The Architecture Machine, 55.\n186 This is consistent with the Computer-Aided Design Project's view of \"design bureaucracy.\" See caption to Figure.\n187 Today we would call these cubes \"voxels\", a word that wasn't available at the time The Architecture Machine was\nwritten.\n188 The form of human-machine interaction proposed in URBAN5 echoes contemporary experiments in language\nprocessing, specifically the early language processing program Eliza developed in 1966 at MIT. Eliza is a computer\nprogram that uses a simple \"pattern-matching\" algorithm to assign pre-canned phrases as responses to sentences\nentered as text by the user. The interaction with the program gave the user the impression-generally for a brief\ntime-of having a conversation with a human (the program simulates being a Rogerian psychotherapist). Eliza was\nwritten in 1966 byJoseph Weizenbaum at MIT, and is considered an early example of automated language\nprocessing. There are many available online implementations of the program. One can be found at \"Eliza Test\",\naccessedJanuary 10, 2011, http://chayden.net/eliza/Eliza.html.\n\n52\n\n\nsuggests true dialogue, suggests an evolutionary system, suggests an intelligent\n\nsystem -but, in itself, is none of these. 189\n\nAn example of the second, \"participatory\" category is the \"Hessdorfer Experiment,\" in which three\n\nAfrican-US-American men from \"Boston's ghetto area\" are asked to interact with a machine\n\ncomprising only a keyboard and a printer head remotely operated by one of the researchers- that\n\ninterrogates them about their \"urban needs.\" In the book, Negroponte celebrates that during the\n\nexperiment the subjects (who thought they were communicating with an autonomous machine) \"did not\n\ntype uncalled-for remarks,\" arguing that the men engaged the machine in a way that wouldn't have taken\n\nplace if the interlocutor was a \"white planner or politician.\"190 The book thus presents the experiment as\n\nevidence of the computer's potential to foster a more transparent conversation with members of a\n\n\"community.\" The fact that the book is outdated from a racial, nomenclatural point of view, is self-\n\nevident, but the kind of neutrality Negroponte is willing to attribute to the machine is worthy of notice. In\n\nthe Hessdorfer Experiment, the machine is assumed as a neutral device that helps the researchers conceal\n\ntheir personas and, quite specifically, their whiteness.\"1 ' [See Figure 11]\n\nDavid Noble wrote, \"technology rarely fulfills the fantasies of their creators. As people are fallible, so\n\ntoo are their machines, however perfect, complete, and automatic the designs.\" 192Yet, even failed\n\ntechnologies carry a blueprint of its makers' time, desires, and questions. URBAN5 and the machine in\n\nthe Hessdorfer Experiment project design as a collaborative, quantifiable and evolving dialogue with always-\n\nadapting machines, expressing a desire for design to become a more rational and \"social\" endeavor -\n\ndevoid of what Negroponte construes as the elitist subjectivity of the human architect. The Architecture\n\nMachine's aspirations to dilute the designer's authorial agency through mechanically-enabled participation\n\nexpresses an anxiety about the social role played by the disciplines of architecture and planning.

The aspiration is phrased in a populist language, that seeks to give people, through\n\ntechnology, the right to design their own environments. 193\n\nRephrasing machines as social agents\n\nAside from a post-structural fantasy of \"killing the author,\" the symbolic demotion, or reconfiguration,\n\nof the architect in The Architecture Machine should be understood as a rationalist reaction to the\n\nI Negroponte, The Architecture Machine, 93.\n190 Negroponte, The Architecture Machine, 50.\n\" I While also concealing the politics of the experimental set up.\n1 92Noble, Forces of Production, 325.\n19 A few years later, in a less enthusiastic tone, Negroponte would admit the naivet6 of these experiments (see\nNicholas Negroponte, Reflections on Computer Aids to Design and Architecture (New York: Petrocelli/Charter,\n1975)) the notion of democratic empowerment through technology remained a constant of his work nonetheless.\n\n53\n\n\nindividualistic notion of author as a sole creator inherited by architecture from L'Ecole de Beaux-Arts -in\n\nfact, Bruegmann places Negroponte in a tradition of rationalism that goes back toJ.N.L. Durand. 194The\n\nnotion of a machine that learns by itself is instrumental in affording Negroponte the space to ignore\n\nquestions about the machine's nature as a designed artifact, and to inspire questions about authorial\n\nagency in computer aided design:\n\nWhen a designer supplies a machine with step-by-step instructions for solving a\nspecific problem, the resulting solution is unquestionably attributed to the\ndesigner's ingenuity and labors (...) Whenever a mechanism is equipped with a\nprocessor capable of finding a method \"of finding a method of solution,\" the\nauthorship of the answer probably belongs to the machine.195\n\nThe rhetoric of participation and democracy discussed above shows how The Architecture Machine seeks a\n\nlarger cultural goal besides architectural critique. Primordially, to challenge cultural critics who, like\n\nMumford, were concerned with the de-humanizing aspects of a technological society, and with the rise of\n\nan unquestionable scientific ideology. As a reaction, The Architecture Machine represents computers -and\n\nCAD- as agents of social and environmental democratic activism. Crucial to the advancement of this\n\nvision is a rhetoric that speaks of machines as social entities mirroring the attributes of humans, while\n\ndirecting attention away from the technologist's role as the machine's designer. This point deserves careful\n\nanalysis.\n\nIn The Architecture Machine Negroponte adopts the technologies developed by the Computer Aided Design\n\nProject as the constitutive elements of his vision. However, he rejects the dualism between creativity and\n\nanalysis that rendered computers as the \"perfect-slaves\" of a design process.196 Instead, Negroponte\n\ndeploys a language endowing computers with human-like attributes such as curiosity and judgment,\n\nconstruing human-machine interaction as the \"cohabitation of two intelligent species,\"1 97 as a symbiotic\n\nrelationship that gave origin to an \"extended designer\", and as an \"ecology of mutual design\n\ncomplementation, augmentations, and substitution.\")1\n\nI 94Bruegmann, \"The Pencil and the Electronic Sketchpad\", 140.\n195 The repetition is in the original, speaking of the desire of generality. Instead of seeking a solution, what is sought\nis a method for finding any solution. Negroponte, The Architecture Machine, 11\n196 In a 1966 lecture Coons described computers and numerically controlled manufacturing technology as \"perfect\nslaves\" who would take over the most laborious and repetitive aspects of artistic and engineering production-a\nstatement that notoriously resembled Alberti's ideas about the distinction between the architect (who draws) and the\n\"skilled craftsman\" (who makes). I discuss this iin more detial in Cardoso Llach, \"Design and the Automated Utopia:\nCertain Assumptions in Digital Design Culture.\"\n197 See Negroponte, The Architecture Alachine, 7 & 17.\n198 Despite these rhetorical differences, Coons's themes are audible throughout T7e Architecture Machine. Among these,\nthe notion of adaptability deserves special analysis. Coons distinguished between two different CAD philosophies,\none that relied on a large set of specialized procedures and another that relied on a single one that adapts to its\ncontext. Coons was wary about the risk of narrowing the space of design alternatives in a computer-aided design\n\n54\n\n\nBy re-positioning machines as humans, The Architecture Machine seeks to overcome -rhetorically at\n\nleast- the mechanical-organicist polarity that concerned those who saw technology and people in\n\nopposing camps.' 99 But the move to equate humans and machines reproduced the polarity because, by\n\nusing a symmetric language that obscured the machine's complex ties to its makers, it broke the bridge\n\nbetween the two. From a \"perfect-slave,\" by virtue of The Architecture Machine, technology came to be\n\nrepresented as human. Both views, however, shut down technology's material and cultural specificity as\n\ndomains of analysis. For this reason The Architecture Machine fails both as an architectural and social\n\ncritique.\n\nConsidering, with Lewis Mumford, technologies as embodiments of social relations, and The Architecture\n\nMachine's still-abundant progeny in academic research and industry circles, 200 we can think of the socio-\n\nsystem by overloading the software-and the user-with a large set of very specialized procedures. See Coons, \"An\nOutline of the Requirements for a Computer-Aided Design System,\" 301. In The Architecture Machine Negroponte\nechoes the contrast between these two philosophies by opposing the notion of flexibility -the capacity of a system to\nbe extended within a fixed set of constraints- to the notion of adaptability -the ability of a single computational\nprocedure to find solutions to different problems. In Coons's and Negroponte's view, user interfaces and\nprogramming languages could provide flexibility, but not \"true\" adaptability:\n\"We have a condition in where each designer is creating his own library of services out of the problem-oriented\n\n[programming] language. Once created, note that these operations are no less rigid than the predefined package of\ndesign commodities.\" Negroponte, 7he Architecture Aachine, 27. However, the means and methods to achieve\nadaptability are never discussed, and thus adaptability remains as a suggestive device -a black box enclosing\ncomputers' hoped-for potential to revert the perverse effects of industrial standardization and of the notion of\nl'homme type on architectural and urban space. The notion of l'homme type (French for \"man-type\", or \"typical\nman\") was a collection of anthropometric assumptions about architecture's \"end-user\" advanced by advocates of\nmodern architecture, especially in the first half of the twentieth century, to facilitate (and legitimize) standardized\nresidential housing design. Abiding by these assumptions could only yield, in Negroponte's view, impersonal and\nbanal architecture.\n199 \"What needs to be articulated, regardless of the format of the man-machine relationship, is the goal of humanism\nthrough machines. (...) The concern is to avoid dehumanizing a process whose aim is definitely humanization.\" See\nNegroponte, 77e Architecture Machine, 7. Matthew Visniosky's history of engineers' temporary reconciliation with\nsocial theory during the fifties and sixties captures and elaborates on the contrast between these two postures about\ntechnology and society by distinguishing between two philosophies, a theory of technological change, which attributes\nagency to technology as a semi-autonomous force, and a theory of technological politics, which considers technology as an\n\"embodiment of social relations.\" Matthew Wisniosky \"Engineers and the Intellectual Crisis of Technology\" (Ph.D.\ndiss., Princeton University, 2005), 6.\n200 Some futures never get old. Despite some superficial differences, the ambition (illustrated in Negroponte's work)\nto enable an objective and scientific approach to design by replacing a human architect with a machine, is alive and\nwell in contemporary design cultures. The languages of today's Architecture Machines have shifted from the mechanistic\nidioms of robotic experts, into a blend of biological and computational metaphors. The new idioms reflect the\ndominance of a new techno-scientific (and eco-moral) paradigm, but the rationalist drive remains intact under the\nnew rubric of the \"performance-based.\" In today's Architecture Machines, the emphasis on the idea of adaptability is no\nlonger deployed through the fantasy of an artificial mind, but through biologically inspired, computationally\nobtained variation. The reaction against the architect's subjectivity is not enacted by human-like machines, such as\nthose advanced in Negroponte's vision, but by the unquestionable, faceless authority of an algorithmic conception of\nthe natural. Tropes of democracy and participation in design persist in the desire of diluting authorial agency in the\nassumed pluralism of multi-user Internet applications. On the hardware side, the electronic sketchpads of cathode-\nray tube monitors are replaced today by hopeful interpretations of associative software platforms, plasma screens and\nincreasingly precise layer deposition 3-D printing technologies.\n\n55\n\n\ntechnical utopia of empowerment via adaptable, social, democratic -and \"neutral\"-\n\ninaugurating MIT's own particular sort of technocratic idealism. 20\n\nmachines, as\n\n201 Negroponte's techno-cultural entrepreneurship in The Architecture Machine, is framed as a critique of the\n\"gendeman architect,\" an idea of architectural practice predicated on the notion of the inherent value of dwellings\nand urban spaces by virtue of their uniqueness. By proposing to automate the production of uniqueness -via\nmachines that amortize the time and labor involved- Negroponte's work anticipates a desire -and a market- for\ndigitally mass-customized goods. In short, it shaped the act of design into a valuable commodity, defining it in turn as\nthe symbolic, bounded, manipulation of abstract objects. While it would be unproductive to attempt to quantify the\nsuccess or failure of the compelling technological utopia registered in The Architecture Machine in terms of its social\n\"impact,\" given the distance between its ambitions of social change, and the ironies of its deployment into popular\nculture, it may be worth noting that Negroponte's inversion of the design equation -from the gentleman architect\ninto the gentleman dwelle- does not fundamentally alter the nature of the transaction.\n202 In the case of the OLPC project, the \"top-down\" approach is literal, as Negroponte intended to throw the\ncomputers from helicopters into the \"communities.\" Mark Hachman, \"Negroponte: We'll Throw OLPCs Out of\nHelicopters to Teach Kids to Read I News & Opinion I PCMag.com,\" PCMag.con, n.d.,\nhttp://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2395763,00.asp#fbid=yj2DHk4jyPG.\n203 Mexican artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer makes the case about his artistic practice as a non-representational\nartistic form by virtue of the fact that he creates scenarios for participation. The question that needs to be articulated is\nwhat are the forms of representation that are inscribed in staged participatory and collective actions.\n\n56\n\nThe Negroponte paradox: Prescribing participation\n\nThe imaginaries of participation set in motion by The Architecture Machine -the vision of a\n\ntechnologically democratized planning and design- anticipate a global cultural enterprise of\n\nconstruing technology as a democratizing force, uplifting supposedly under-privileged, non-\n\nwhite and \"third-world\" communities. The vaguely described \"third-world\" child subjects\n\nwho constitute the targets of the OLPC project are the contemporary equivalents of the\n\ncarefully chosen black African-American Boston residents in the \"Hessdorfer experiment.\"\n\nIn both cases, unmanned technological systems -for education and design, respectively-\n\nare presented as platforms of bottom-up development. What remains obscured by assuming,\nlike Negroponte does, the neutrality of such systems, is the fact that setting up the\n\ntechnological stages for the imagined bottom-up processes constitutes a top-down operation 2o2.\n\nParadoxically, the emancipatory discourse of technologically-enabled participation frames\n\nthe tacit claim that, without technology, subjects are ill-suited to participate, and thus are\n\ndevoid -in discourse- of political and social agency. Participation is, in this sense, a\n\ncolonizing trope203 that seeks to shape the subjects into prescribed modes of agency\n\nconstrued as the only valid forms of political and social action.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nAn algorithmic tectonics\n\nReminding us of the inevitably material dimension of architecture, historian and architectural theorist\n\nKenneth Frampton conjures the Greek voice \"Tekton\" to redeem the structural articulation of\n\narchitecture -the craft of itsjoiner- as the discipline's fundamental vector. 204 A similarly constructionist\n\nsensibility can be used to understand how, within the vibrant cultures of technology production that\n\nevolved at MIT during the US-American post-war age, students and researchers formulated a\n\ntechnological discourse of design and design representation premised on the newly-found structured\n\ncharacter of computational abstractions. Paraphrasing Frampton, in these discourses I identify the\n\nemergence, from within the engineering culture of the Project, of an algorithmic tectonics: a new imaginary of\n\ndesign and design representation, configured around the structured character of computational\n\ndescriptions.\n\nBy talking about the production of computational representations as a form of building, the engineering\n\ncommunity developing the Computer-Aided Design Project defined a metaphorical arena allowing its members\n\nto project tectonic qualities onto computational descriptions, mostly premised on computational\n\nabstractions' capacity to configure interrelated data structures indexing multiple kinds of description as\n\nattributes.\n\nBuilding design and construction gave the engineers of the Project a set of practices and material\n\nsubstrates they could use as subjects to evaluate the general theories of abstraction defined by the plex and\n\nthe AED languages. In the process, these engineers re-imagined conceptions of design, representation and\n\nwork, in the language of the machine. This is illustrated by the constitution of design as problem solving by\n\nthe participants of the Computer-Aided Design Project.205\n\nCrucial to our understanding of the algorithmic tectonics is the encoding of perspective mathematics in the\n\ncomputer. Roberts's innovation enabled the representation of three-dimensional objects in the symbolic\n\nspace of the computer, enabling new claims about the computer as a universal representation machine. I\n\nidentify in this moment the emergence of a crucial representational tradition based on the intersection, in\n\nthe computer, of Albertian perspectivalism and computerized data processing.\n\n204 \"Tekton\" means carpenter.

In this sense\n\nand others, computing has been constituted as a kind of imperialism; it aims to\n\nreinvent virtually every other site of practice in its own image.2 0 8\n\nThis chapter has shown how the US-American engineers behind the Computer-Aided Design Project were\n\nnot only concerned with the technical production of technological systems, but also with re-imagining\n\nentire fields of practice in the language and image of the computer. Coons, Ross, and the other\n\nparticipants of the culture of technology development located around the Computer-Aided Design Project,\n\nformulated and promoted a sophisticated theory of design linked to the technologies they developed. The\n\npurpose of this theory was not only to guide the technical efforts, but to create a new public understanding\n\nof design. 209 From this perspective, these engineers were public intellectuals 2 1' who sought to transform\n\nsocial conceptions of design, representation, and work, both through their artifacts and theories. They\n\nwere committed to the diffusion of these theories through different outlets -not only to academic, but\n\nalso to popular cultures. Nicholas Negroponte's adoption of the Project's discourses is evidence of the\n\neffectiveness of these engineers' techno-cultural entrepreneurship (See frame \"The machine in context\"\n\nbelow).\n\nDespite the fact that, besides the Sketchpad, the technologies developed in the project had only a\n\nmoderate impact on industry, 21' the technological and cultural entrepreneurship of the Project succeeded in\n\n200 Realms of reality that seem far apart (mechanics, economics, marketing, scientific organization of work) are\n\ninches apart, once flattened out onto the same surface. The accumulation of drawings in an optically consistent\n\nspace is, once again, the 'universal exchanger' that allows work to be planned, dispatched, realized, and\n\nresponsibility to be attributed. Latour, \"Visualisation and Cognition: Drawing Things Together,\" 26.\n207 Latour, \"Visualisation and Cognition: Drawing Things Together.\"\n208 Philip Agre, Computation and Human Experience (Cambridge University Press, 1997), 131.\n20) This is illustrated by their academic and media advocacy of technology.\n210 The phrase \"public intellectual\" is used to refer to persons who engage society with theories. By using it to\n\ndescribe the Project's engineers I seek to attract attention to the fact that the artifacts and theories they created had\n\neffects beyond \"merely\" functional applications, and in fact transformed social views on what designing, building,\ndrawing, being creative, means. I want, also, to attract attention to the fact that technologies are discursive.\n211 Especially in comparison with Douglas T. Ross's previous project, the APT language (in some ways a direct\n\npredecessor to the CAD project), which became the industry standard programming language for automated\n\n58\n\n\ntransforming the popular imagination of design by re-creating its sites of practice in the language of the\n\ncomputer [Figures 12 through 14].\n\nThis can be construed as a disciplinarily and epistemologically imperialistic project, premised on the\n\nconstitution of the computer as a universal representation machine. A Cartesian imagination of the world\n\nas a mathematically quantifiable space premised on the newly found algorithmic tectonics of design and\n\ndesign representation. 212\n\nThe machine in context\n\nIn The Architecture Machine Negroponte used the rhetoric and tools of a nascent techno-\n\nscientific culture to formulate a populist project of design where machines are presented as\n\nneutral, ethical artifacts, and as democratizing alternatives to the authority of professional\n\ndesigners. I have pointed out how this technological advocacy purports to deliver a social\n\nand architectural critique, yet is ineffective because of its failure to consider the crucial role of\n\nthose who design the machines as important vectors in design and design discourse. 2 13\n\nThe Architecture Machine is often seen as a foundational piece of Human-Machine Interaction\n\n(HMI) literature. This chapter shows how, rather than an isolated product, it's structurally\n\nconnected to the larger context of technology and culture production of the Computer-Aided\n\nDesign Project. This context was largely shaped by the spirit of discovery of a new engineering\n\nculture developing around computers. supported by the US Air Force funding at MIT\nduring the post-war years. A contribution of this chapter is thus a new reading of\n\nNegroponte's role in the constitution of a technological design culture during the second half\n\nof the 20th century, informed by the structural connections between his pursuits and those of\n\nhis professors and contemporaries working at the Lincoln Labs as part of the CAD Project.\n\nThe discourses of technological emancipation of design became stories with which later\n\ndesign communities -particularly those rooted in architecture schools- shaped the\n\ndiscourses of design, architecture and technology. 214\n\nmachine tool control.Bryan Marquard, \"Doug Ross, 77; developed APT computer language,\" The Boston Globe\n\n(Boston, February 10, 2007), sec.

These architects sought to construe the virtual worlds of computers as a realm of its own (the media as\n\nsubject). See, for instance. Alfredo Andia, \"Reconstructing the Effects of Computers on Practice and Education\n\nDuring the Past Three Decades,\" Journal ofArchitectural Education 56, no. 2 (November 1, 2002): 7-13.\n214 Brian Pfaffenberger suggests that technology makers attempt to change the social world in which its technology\n\nexists. In this view, the trope of the \"personal computer revolution\" can be seen as a myth deliberately created by\ninterested parties trying to sell hardware and consolidate a market for technology. The ways in which the users will\nuse the tools, however, is unexpected and rarely conforms to prior conceptions. See Pfaffenberger, B. (1989).

Anthropological Quarterly\n\n(61), 39-47.\n\n59\n\n\nA key aspect of this role was to broadcast to communities of design and architecture the\n\nconcepts of adaptability and automation developed by the engineering cultures of the Project,\nhelping activate a process of discursive co-construction of design and technology. The\n\nconstitution, in 1985, of the MIT MediaLab, collects and multiplies this sensibility. However,\nits examination is outside the scope of this study.215\n\n215 I hope other researchers take on this question.\n\n60\n\n\nFigure 1. Project MAC 25th Anniversary Poster.

Ross, an Electronics Systems Labora-\ntory researcher, a cadre of their colleagues, and a platoon\nof graduate students are working under Air Force con-\ntract (No. AF-33(600)-42859).\n\nTheir goal: A man-machine system in which the com-\nputer is an active partner with the creative designer; two\nway communication is handled with ease; the computer\naccepts and analyzes the designer's rough sketches and\nperforms all (or nearly all) the design calculations Says\nProfessor Coons: \"The system does som reasonable for\nthe near future.\" He anticipates economic feasibility within\nten years; technical feasibility is much closer.\n\nThe ultimate goal is automatic manufacture after the\nman-machine design team has established design features.\nYou will be able to go directly from the designer's rough\nsketches to the tape montrolled or computer controlled\nprocessing equipment It means you will need the capa-\nbility to communicate with the machine via words and\ngraphics, have the machine fully comprehend your mean-\ning, and have it translate your expressed wishes into\nmodels Professor Coons says the system \"will be as use-\nful and flexible a tool as the lead pencil, easier to use\nthan the pencil, and certain to find applications we've\nnever even considered.\"\n\n0 The Big Promise-Consider this example of what the\nsystem will ultimately offer the manufacturer:\n\nThirty (or 40, or 2D, or 1) designers will sit at oscil-\nloscope screens, with light pens in hand. They're sur-\nrounded by toggle switches, a telephone, a few con-\ntrolled knobs, and other simple electronic gear. Say one\nis designing a turbine shaft. Another-perhaps in a\nseparate building-is designing the turbine blades. The\ndesigner drawing the shaft makes some rough strokes on\nthe screen with his light pen, manipulates a few toggle\nswitches, and a beautifully contoured shaft appears on the\nscreen. Now he calls onto his screen the turbine blade\nassembly drawn by the other engineer and couples that\nassembly to his shaft. It's time to check out stress. He\npicks up the phone and dials a stress analyst. That man\ncranks into the computer all the inputs required to ana-\n\ncerned with how to pay for a process than with the\ndetails of its operation.\n\nWhat characteristics had Mr. Cyrol said such men\nshould have? \"Know the arithmetic of business.

SOFTWARE'S EMPIRE\n\nThe practical problem of building design can be formulated, in a general way,\nas an optimization problem. 22 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOutline\n\nIn this chapter I consider aspects of the evolution of the CAD industry. In particular, I show how it\n\nevolved more in tune with the circumstances of the market, than with the structured representations\n\nimagined by the Computer Aided Design Project's engineers, or with the robo-utopias of participation and\n\ndemocracy imagined by Negroponte. Moreover, I consider the related but different trajectory traced by\n\nthe computerized forms of work that made their way into professional architectural practice to\n\ncontextualize the technology project known in industry as Building Information Modeling. Through the voices\n\nof prominent advocates, I identify a renewed expression of the 1960s themes of structured representation,\n\ntechnological centrality, and scientific-managerial control over design and construction practices.\n\nContext of adoption\n\nBecause of technological limitations and commercial circumstances, the CAD software industry took\n\ndistance from these Project's ambitions, and commercialized instead tools that drew -more modestly- on\n\ndrafting practices.\n\nBefore the wide adoption of Computer-Aided Design software by architects in the 1980s, a few firms\n\nused computers to aid in structural and cost-analysis calculations. According to Kristine Fallon 222 the first\n\narchitectural firm to purchase a punch-card computer system was Ellerbe Associates in 1958 in the US.\n\n221 G. Neil Harper, \"BOP: An Approach to Building Optimization,\" in Proceedings of the 1968 23rd A CM.National\nConference, ACM '68 (New York, NY, USA: ACM, 1968), 575, http://doi.acm.org/10. 1145/800186.810621.\n222 Kristine K. Fallon, The AEC Technology Survival Guide: Managing Today's Information Practice, 1st ed. (Wiley, 1997),\n150.\n\n73\n\n\nHowever, it was Skidmore Owings and Merril (SOM) -the large US firm based in Chicago- the first\n\nfirm to develop, in 1967, a program with the intent of \"solving\" the design of a whole building. The\n\nprogram, called Building Optimization Program (BOP), optimized building costs against four basic building\n\nvariables: \"Window Wall,\" \"Elevatoring,\" \"HVAC\" and \"Structural.\" 223 According to BOP's author, Neil\n\nHarper, \"the practical problem of building design [could] be formulated, in a general way, as an\n\noptimization problem.\" 224 BOP is presented as the first \"knowledge-based\" 225 computer aided design\n\nsystem for architecture [See Figure 15]. By declaring design as optimization, the BOP illustrates SOM's\n\nstrong commitment to an ideology of production and efficiency. 226 By seeking to account for a range of\n\nbuilding variables including cost and materials -not shape- the program is an early precedent of what\n\nlater would be called Building Information Modeling. According to Kristine Fallon SOM decided, in 1969, to\n\ndevelop modular software and sell computing time to other offices.\n\nBy committing to a view of design as a rational, quantifiable endeavor -as an optimization- BOP\n\nillustrates an ontological politics 227 (a becoming) of design as an expression of a scientific-managerial\n\nideology of production and efficiency.\n\nThe experimental in-house software development by firms like SOM lasted until the 1980s, when the\n\nwide availability of commercial software for architecture -enabled by drop in the price of computing\n\nsystems- led to the wide adoption of CAD by architects. Relative to other industries like the automotive\n\nand aircraft manufacturing, architects were late adopters of computer technology. Because of economies\n\nof scale it was more cost-efficient for the car and aircraft industries to adopt the-at the time-expensive\n\nhardware and software systems required for displaying interactive graphics. When offices started to\n\npurchase the technology from software vendors, most architectural firms became consumers, and not\n\nmakers, of computer-aided design systems.228\n\n223 Harper, \"BOP: An Approach to Building Optimization.\"\n224 Ibid., 575.\n225 In this context, \"knowledge-based\" means that the program manipulates entities with a higher level of\ndescription. Instead of points and lines, for example, a knowledge-based program allows a user to manipulate\ngraphic elements representing walls, or floor plates. The use of the expression \"knowledge-based\" may be an\nindication that the higher-level entities were understood to have semantic knowledge embedded in them.\n226 Firms embraced in-house software development mostly to support accounting, calculations, energy analysis, cost\nestimation and scheduling. See Fallon, The AEC Technology Survival Guide, 150.\n227 See footnote 25.\n228 For historian Robert Bruegmann, cost and efficiency were not the driving factors of architects' adoption of CAD.\nHe suggests that professional architects embraced the computer in the 1980s not because of any of the theoretical\nreasons advanced throughout the 1960s and 1970s (rationalization of design, socio-technical utopias, or the speeding\nup of production), but mainly because they were aesthetically attracted to the images they produced. However, this\nstudy shows this view is simplistic, and reveals some of the larger forces involved in technology's adoption by\narchitects. See Bruegmann, R. (1989).

Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.\n\n74\n\n\nTo illustrate the commercial systems that became dominant in the market, I turn now to the distinction\n\nbetween two commercial CAD systems: AutoCAD and Digital Project. For the purposes of clarity and\n\nsimplicity, I will characterize each as an exemplar of two modeling paradigms. The first one, AutoCAD,\n\nillustrates the geometric modeling paradigm -a Euclidian design world populated by lines, points and\n\nplatonic solids. The second one, Dzgital Project, illustrates the parametric modeling paradigm -a Newtonian\n\ndesign world populated by forces, attributes and constraints. 229 The Euclidian logic of AutoCAD is key to\n\nunderstand the way in which architects adopted CAD, while the Newtonian logic of the Digital Project is\n\nkey to understand the technical dimension underpinning the Building Information Modeling project.\n\nSoftware paradigms\n\nDrafting in a Euclidian universe: a look into AutoCAD\n\nWhile the MIT engineers who formulated the Computer Aided Design Project imagined computational\n\ndescriptions as the structured combination of geometric data and other kinds of information (cost, analysis\n\ninformation, materials). Here, I discuss how, in contrast with these early ideas, the software industry\n\ndeveloped systems that were premised on the more modest aspiration of automating drafting. In AutoCAD,\n\ndrawings are not structured in the sense the CAD Project engineers expected. 230\n\nThe widespread use of mass-produced standardized materials such as steel and glass during the first half\n\nof the twentieth century had already demanded from architects more precision, detail and volume in\n\nbuilding's documentation. The wide adoption, by the 1980s, of CAD-enabled computers appeared to\n\nfacilitate the digital production, manipulation and storage of building descriptions. Commercially\n\nsuccessful CAD tools like Autodesk's AutoCAD, greatly contributed to the practical necessity of\n\naccommodating and managing the larger amounts of information demanded by construction, becoming\n\nthe standards of a new industry and transforming architecture practice. John Walker, Autodesk's CEO\n\n229 These systems are conventionally known in computational design circles as parametric. In Latin para means\n\"besides\" and meter means \"measurement.\" In a parametric modeling software, 3-D representations of geometric\nelements are typically accompanied by numeric values indicating the element's dimensions. Parametric also refers to\nthe associative character of the modeling process: a user can model an object by creating associations between\ngeometric elements, and between geometric elements and numeric values -such as constants, dimensions of other\nelements, etc. This form of modeling is made possible by the underlying data-structures that represent the geometric\nelements in the software's database.\n230 From the perspective of pioneers such as Sutherland, AutoCAD drawings can perhaps be thought of as dirty marks\non the screen.\n\n75\n\n\ncaptures this transformation when he writes of AutoCAD \"never underestimate the power of a widely\n\ndistributed tool.\" 231\n\nBoth the design of its interface and the data structures were designed to re-create the draftsperson's\n\nworkspace and tools. Its interface was imagined metaphorically as a window looking into a drafting table\n\nwith an unlimited paper sheet; the commands were named after technical drafting instruments or\n\ngeometric elements (\"line,\" \"ellipse\") and eventually arrayed within \"toolboxes\" with icons pointing at\n\ndigital representations of analog tools; a system of \"layers\" was included to reproduce the flexibility of\n\ndrafting on overlaying sheets of tracing paper.232 Moreover, its data structures are intended to describe\n\ngeometric elements at a low level: points, lines, polygons. AutoCAD's data-structures were -and still are-\n\nnon-hierarchical and non-relational, favoring design operations in which elements get created and stored\n\nas single instances -rather than as references to a \"template\" object. AutoCAD is thus tuned to easily\n\nrepresent Euclidian primitives, but not complex associations of elements, like architectural objects. The\n\nkind of design operations AutoCAD facilitates are based on transformations and operations such as copy,\n\narray, mirror, rotate, etc., reflecting the ideology of standardization of twentieth century architecture's\n\nmeans of construction.\n\nAs a result of its design, working in AutoCAD feels like manipulating digital versions of traditional tools.\n\nBy creating an affordable computational version of the draftsman's table, the programmers at Autodesk\n\nbrought into architectural practice a series of practical improvements. First, having architectural\n\ninformation encoded in chains of bits -instead of in paper and ink- not only facilitated the storage and\n\nrecording of design descriptions, but reduced the labor associated with operations such as duplicating,\n\ndeleting, scaling and rotating elements of the design, allowing for easier transformations of the design\n\ndocuments; second, the possibility of zooming in and out of a drawing made it possible to manage\n\nincreased levels of detail in drawings. 233 These underlying structures define the ways in which shapes can\n\nbe manipulated within the system. By enabling certain forms of storage and manipulation, software\n\n231 See the Appendix for further detail into the design of AutoCAD. Quote is from:John Walker, ed., TheAutodesk\nFile: Bits of History, Words of Experience, 3rd ed. (Que Pub, 1989), 300.\n232 Media theorist Lev Manovich uses the term \"remediation\" to refer to this quality, defining it as \"the\nrepresentation of one medium in another\". Lev Manovich argues that the potential of computers to provide\nopportunities beyond the imitation of earlier media was exploited since the first applications, and discusses cases of\ncomputational media pioneers (Sutherland, Kay, Nelson, Englebart) who extended the functionality of their\napplications beyond the metaphorical. Manovich suggests that in Alan Kay's first drawing tools at Xerox Parc, the\ninterface metaphor worked as a way to lure users into the digital media, yet only to disclose other potentialities -\nincluding the extension of the application via programming of new components. See Lev Manovich, \"Software\nTakes Command (book Draft)\", n.d., http://lab.softwarestudies.com/2008/11/softbook.html.\n233 See Chapter 3 for a critical discussion about this view of related conceptions of fabrication machinery by Steven\nCoons and others.\n\n76\n\n\nsystems like AutoCAD condition designs outcomes and the cultures of its practice. 234 The bigger the system,\n\nthe more difficult it is to modify. By 1986 AutoCAD consisted in more than a million lines of C code235 and\n\nembodied more than 70 man-years of development. Its data structures were hard and expensive to\n\nmodify, and remain relatively unchanged at its core today.236\n\nI have discussed how the application that colonized the market of architecture thus fell short to the\n\nambitions of structuredness and centrality formulated by the early CAD pioneers. During a SIGGRAPH\n\nmeeting in 1989 Robin Forrest, a contemporary of Sutherland who was a visiting researcher at the Project\n\nMAC in 1967,237 was asked to comment on his views on the CAD project. The following excerpt\n\nillustrates the CAD pioneers' disappointment at the course taken by the industry:2 s3\n\nSo CAD really meant more in 1965 than it does nowadays. It linked into\ncomputer-aided manufacture and I feel sometimes that CAD has been somewhat\ndebased by some of the vendors that you used to see on the floor at SIGGRAPH.\nThe 'D' became not design, but drafting. I once asked a vendor what his program\ncould do other than produce drawings. He look[ed] absolutely amazed that you\nwould ever want to do anything other than produce drawings. 239\n\nModeling in a Newtonian universe: a look into Gehry Technologies's Digital Project\n\nIf the experience of using traditional geometric drafting systems, like AutoCAD, stems from the paradigm\n\nof drawing on a traditional drafting table, setting up a parametric model \"feels\" like building a machine.\n\nPut in another way, if AutoCAD can be thought of as being built on an Euclidian representational\n\nparadigm of geometric elements (points, lines) and their transformations, Digital Project can be thought of\n\nas based on a Newtonian representational paradigm of forces, dependencies, and attributes. Digital Project\n\noffers an environment similar to a mechanic's table where materials and tools are available for the\n\ndesigner to build mechanisms, rather than fixed representations (the rectangle is not only one rectangle,\n\nbut potentially many).\n\n234 Roll Over Euclid Mitchell argues that \"Architects tend to draw what they can build, and build what they can\ndraw.\" See Mitchell, V. (2001). Roll Over Euclid. In F.J. Ragheb, Frank Gehry, Architect (pp. 352-363). New York:\nGuggenheim Museum Publications.\n235 C is the programming language in which AutoCAD is written.\n236 Walker, The Autodesk File.\n237 He credits himself with having published the first paper on Computational Geometry. J. Hurst et al.,\n\"Retrospectives II: The Early Years in Computer Graphics at MIT, Lincoln Lab, Andd Harvard,\" in ACM\nSIGGRAPH 89 Panel Proceedings, SIGGRAPH '89 (New York, NY, USA: ACM, 1989), 39-73,\nhttp://doi.acm.org/10.1145/77276.77280.\n238 SIGGRAPH stands for \"Special Interest Group in Computer Graphics.\"\n239 .SIGGRAPH '89, 66.\n\n77\n\n\nUnlike AutoCAD, Digital Project has the capacity to manipulate higher-level descriptions of geometric\n\nelements. These systems enforce on the user a modeling process distinctively hierarchical, compared to\n\nthat of AutoCAD, or other geometric modeling packages.\n\nThe set of associations and constraints defined in the model implicitly declares a design-space: a space\n\nof possible variations that is explored in the process of manipulating the model. This particular attribute,\n\nof movement, also hints at the mechanical metaphor on which Digital Project is based as an engineering\n\ntool. Users of Digital Project are cast as mechanics of designs; they use the system's tools to define design\n\ndescriptions in terms of relationships and constraints. In turn, they also abide by a certain way of thinking\n\nabout and going about designing.\n\nWhen Digital Project V1R4 opens, a light blue window greets the user and introduces the system in\n\nrounded lower caps. Behind the title, a curved shape in a darker shade of blue -Gelhy Technologies's logo-\n\ndepicts a wave, or perhaps an unconventional building envelope. Besides the software's name the window\n\nindicates GT's url as a sort of signature. After a few seconds the blue window disappears and without\n\nfurther introduction the user is left before Digital Project's empty desktop screen -colored in the same light\n\nblue tones and topped by a conventional Windows menu: Start, File, Options, and Help. Until now\n\nthere's no indication of why Digital Project is conventionally referred to as an advanced \"parametric\"\n\nmodeling software for architecture.\n\nA look to the \"Start\" menu yields several items defined within the software as \"workbenches\" -literally\n\nsets of tools intended to facilitate specific kind of tasks. When a \"workbench\" is activated Digital Project\n\nchanges its interface, opens new toolbars and closes others, shape-shifting into a different system. Selecting\n\none workbench sometimes produces a radical change in the look and feel of the interface. The workbench\n\n2D Layoutfor 3D Design under the Project Center category, for example, activates a series of toolbars\n\nresembling those of AutoCAD, in fact providing comparable functionality: ruled paper, orthogonal views,\n\nand an assortment of 2-D drafting tools. The 2D Layoutfor 3D Design workbench is a little AutoCAD\n\nembedded within Digital Project. Another workbench, Architecture and Structures, groups tools that include pre-\n\nloaded libraries of parametric -that is, modifiable- versions of architectural elements such as columns,\n\nwindows, etc. The workbench Imagine and Shape -notice the association of imagination and fluid 3-D\n\nshapes- contains tools oriented to the \"free-form\" modeling of surfaces. Other categories contain\n\nworkbenches for specific aspects of the design/construction process. The Engineering category, for example,\n\ncontains tools designed for deploying technical descriptions of MEP services, such as pipes and electrical\n\nnetworks. The Analysis and Simulation category gives access to tools for performing different structural and\n\nmaterial tests and for defining \"knowledge-based\" features such as user-generated rule-sets. Other\n\ncategories, such as Project Standards have workbenches that help connect the model with existing databases\n\n78\n\n\nof materials and architectural supplies. There's even a Project Advisor feature with an icon shaped as a\n\npixilated owl with spectacles -a sophisticated version of the famous Microsoft Word's Clip helper?\n\nWhile Digital Project is a 3-D environment, the standard way of creating objects is to create a 2-D sketch.\n\nIn a sketch, a user can draw a quadrangular polygon by selecting the line tool with a pointing device and\n\nclicking on four points on the screen. With each pair of clicks a line segment will be created, as a rubber\n\nband, from one point in the screen to the next. Once the polygon is created, it is \"unconstrained:\"\n\ndragging each point with the pointing device can freely move them, and the lines. The user, however, can\n\nstart \"constraining\" it by, for example, selecting two adjacent line segments and specifying in a dialog box\n\nthat they should be always perpendicular. All of the other polygon components then can be moved freely,\n\nlike before, but the \"constrained\" lines now will always form a right angle. The sketch can be further\n\nconstrained by, for example, specifying that the short sides of the figure will always be greater than one\n\nfeet, and less than five feet. The result of this process is -voila- a rectangle of variable side [Figure 16].\n\nOnce outside the sketch, the new geometry is visible in the 3-D space (in CAD talk this is called the\n\n\"viewport\"), and can be edited using conventional 3-D tools -such as extrusion, sectioning, etc.- and\n\nfurther associated and constrained with other geometries. In Digital Project every element is either a Part or\n\na Product, words that hint at the system's origin as a tool for mechanical engineering.\n\nWhenever a new element, such as our rectangle above, is created, the software adds it -as a \"part,\" or\n\nas a \"product\"- to an ordered \"tree\" located to the left of the viewport, which represents the hierarchical\n\nstructure of the model [Figure 17]. The tree in the user interface lists every element added to the model,\n\nand acts both as a way to navigate the model and select its components, and as a way to explicitly record\n\nthe history of the modeling process. At the software level, this \"Product Tree\" is a fundamental difference\n\nbetween Digital Project and other (non-parametric) systems. In contrast with traditional geometric modeling\n\nsystems such as AutoCAD and MicroStation, Digital Project is based on a relational data-structure in which\n\nall the geometric elements constituting a model are hierarchically arranged and linked. 240 One of the\n\neffects of these linkages for the design process is a clear distinction between a \"driving geometry\" -a set\n\nof geometric elements and parameters that govern the behavior of the whole model- and a \"driven\n\ngeometry\" -a set of elements whose behavior is dictated by the driving geometry- within the global and\n\nlocal constraints defined in the model. It is in this sense that designing within Digital Project is equivalent to\n\nmodel with constraints and associations,2 4 1 rather than with lines and planes. Such is the \"mechanics\" of\n\nDigital Project [Figure 18].\n\n24 Rather than hierarchical trees, geometric modeling systems' data structures are more like non-hierarchical lists of elements.\n241 This idea is explored in depth in Axel Kilian, \"Design Exploration Through Bidirectional Modeling of\nConstraints\" (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2006).\n\n79\n\n\nListening to the Building Information Modeling project\n\nOutline\n\nThe preceding section discussed, with examples, the software paradigms serving as environments for\n\ncomputational design practices. In what follows I illustrate how the Building Information Modeling\n\nproject is presented by 3 key proponents. 242 In my analysis of their accounts, I focus on illustrating aspects\n\nof the reconfigurations of design, representation, and work concerning this study. I base my analysis\n\nvariously on their published works, presentations, and personal encounters.\n\nAndrew Witt: model as center and as global infrastructure\n\nTrained as both an architect and a mathematician, Andrew Witt is the Director of Research at Gehry\n\nTechnologies. Previously, he was Director at the company's Paris office, where he \"consulted on parametric\n\ndesign, geometric approaches, new technologies, and integrated practice for clients including Gehry\n\nPartners, AteliersJean Nouvel, UN Studio, and Coop Himmelb()au.\" 243 Witt commutes weekly from Los\n\nAngeles -where the company's headquarters are located- to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to teach a\n\ncourse at the Harvard's Graduate School of Design. In this section, I discuss a lecture where Witt made a\n\nconcise introduction to BIM technologies and processes,244 to illustrate crucial questions raised by the\n\nimagined centrality of technology to architecture in Building Infornation Modeling discourse. In the lecture,\n\nWitt introduced the notion of Building Iformation Modeling, to an audience mostly constituted of\n\narchitecture faculty and students, as an \"unprecedented opportunity for designers\" to use a \"complete,\n\nhighly complete, 3-D data model\" to \"comprehensively control the design and construction process\n\nthrough digital tools that allow [for] the tight integration of the intelligence, analytics, and constraints of\n\nvirtually all aspects of the project.\" 245 Witt further described the emerging form of practice as \"concurrent\n\n242 The 3 subjects were chosen because of their role as key promoters -and developers- of the Building Information\nModeling paradigm within architecture academic and professional communities.\n243 From a profile included in the announcement of the talk: Witt, \"Concurrent Design.\"\n244 The lecture was part of the Harvard Graduate School of Architecture's lecture series, and was open to the public.\nThe audience was mostly constituted of architecture faculty and students. {Citation}\n245 Ibid. The emphasis is mine. Witt reinforced the theme of technological centrality: \"Model-centrism -rather than\ndrawing-centrism- is back with a vengeance courtesy of 3-D modeling tools (...) designers have never been so\ninvested in the realization of complex geometry. The encapsulation and automation of mathematical methods in\nsoftware (...) offers a new transparency in the architectural manipulation of mathematics. As designers [are]\nincreasingly de-constructing and building these tools, building their own tools, they build also fluency in the\nunderlying mathematics, and find novel formal applications to them. Competing theorizations of this trend [are]\nactually testing the fertility of a new rigor in design geometry.\" Noam Andrews and Andrew Witt, \"Building\n\n80\n\n\ndesign,\" as an integration of design and construction enabled by the circulation of design information\n\nacross global digital networks. The following excerpt captures this form of practice:\n\n[Concurrent design is the] process of saying: \"OK, design is no longer separate\nfrom construction, from fabrication.\" [Instead, it's about] bringing very high\nfidelity information downstream, so engineering requirements, process constraints,\nas well as ensuring high fidelity information from early in the process. It's a very\nsimple idea.\" 246\n\nWith a world map showing \"the global distribution of the top ten architecture firms in the world,\" Witt\n\ncontended that most \"high-profile\" design firms are located in the Euro-American Northern Hemisphere,\n\nwhile most of the construction is happening the Middle East and China,247 adding a geographical\n\ndimension to the design and construction split. The following excerpts illustrate the case for a new form of\n\ncommunication to satisfy the demands of the increasingly globalized landscape of practice:\n\n[Architecture and building practice is] much more global than it's ever been ...\nyou have all these people you need to collaborate and work together with around\nthe clock, who have very specialized knowledge, increasingly specialized... and we\nneed to put that information together in a much more proactive way. So we need\nto reinvent this dialog. 248\n\nCommunication that happens in this process can be so... pathological, there are\nso many entrenched interests and barriers to the communication of this\ninformation that it really takes nothing less than a radicalprocess change in order to\naffect this sort of process. 24 9\n\nThe \"reinvented dialog\" and \"radical process change\" is thus premised on the reduction of\n\ngeographical and disciplinary distances by digital information of practice -the transformation of activities\n\nand their outcomes into information. In one slide, Witt represents this \"reinvented dialog\" with a diagram\n\nof the process where a cube representing a digital model is surrounded by a number of actors of the design\n\nand construction process. Arrows flowing from the cube connect to all the actors [Figure 19].\n\nConventionally, the schematic structure of a project's organization is shaped as a pyramid: the client and\n\ndeveloper, in that order, are at the top; the architects, contractors and subcontractors, at the base [Figure\n\n20]. Witt's diagram replaces the vertical hierarchy with a centralized one: a ring of actors organized\n\nGeometry - Gallery Talk - YouTube\", February 28, 2012,\nhttp://wwv.youtube.com/watch?feature=player-embedded&v-kbeU87UIzjc.\n246 Witt, \"Concurrent Design.\" See also Andrew Witt, Tobias Nolte, and Dennis Shelden, \"Large-scale Concurrent\nDesign: The Case of Fondation Louis Vuitton,\" in Proceedings of the Design Modeling Symposium, n.d.\n247 This gives the Albertian split a geographical dimension.

The model's central position in the diagram, and the\n\narrows connecting it to all actors, illustrate the imagined role of technology in design and construction as a\n\ncommunication hub for all participants of the design and construction process. 250\n\nIn the following excerpts, a question posed by a student after the lecture forces Witt to address a crucial\n\ncontradiction between the business of practice, and the idea of design empowerment he used to frame the\n\nBIM project at the start of the lecture.\n\nSTUDENT: I'm thinking of this idea about the empowerment of the architect.\n\nBecause it's not so much about, is it more, I mean... It seems to be more about\n\nthe transference of information, and in the software... It doesn't necessarily have\n\nto be the case that the architect is empowered... It's about who's controlling the\n\ncloud and who's controlling the system.\n\nWITT: Well, the party that controls the system is definitively the one... the one\n\nthat... You know, the one that's in charge. Of course we are sympathetic to the\n\narchitect [laughs]. I mean, I for one hope that's the architect! Right? But it's up\n\nfor grabs, right? I mean it's... It's... The game is sort of... And I think that at\n\nsome level there are a lot of very intelligent... well, you know... Fairly intelligent\n\ncontractors who are... [Witt pauses, jokingly, and the audience laughs] ... Who\n\nare ... into this sort of thing. In a way, Gehry Technologies in some level is...\n\nsomehow neutral there... [pauses] But, you know... I, for... I... straight from the\n\nGSD, 25 1 I certainly hope it ends up being the architect. But on some level yes, I\nthink it's... The architect can leverage these relationships. I don't think necessarily\n\nthe technology empowers this party or the other, but I think the architect is well\n\npositioned to... [pauses and smiles] That's totally fair!252\n\nIn Chapter 3 I discussed how, during the days of technological design advocacy by members of the\n\nConputer-Aided Design Project,253 architects were presented with digital technologies as forms of creative\n\nempowerment. 254 As my discussion of Negroponte's techno-populist discourse of design shows, this notion\n\nis often premised on the deletion of the roles of technology's authors and of the politics of technological\n\narrangements. In the exchange between Witt and the student, the diversity of forces shaping the\n\ncontemporary professional and economic landscapes of practice comes into view. In the new geography of\n\ndesign, technology is both center and infrastructure of design. In Witt's account, the architect's place in\n\nthis newly revealed geography is presented as a matter of sympathy -a concession by the \"party in\n\ncharge.\" As a professional architect, Witt understands the conflict well. The center of the diagram, and\n\n250 This is a conventional representation of BIM.\n251 Harvard Graduate School of Design.\n252 Witt, \"Concurrent Design.\"\n253 See Chapter 3.\n254\n\n82\n\n\nthe arrows connecting it to the peripheral ring of trades, not only represent a change in the flow of\n\ninformation, but a new form of organization of practice around the social and technological\n\ninfrastructures of digital models: \"The party that controls the system is the party in charge.\" In this case,\n\nthe organizations developing and commanding the digital infrastructures of design, like Gehy Technologies,\n\nand those who can afford to hire them.\n\nChuck Eastman: towards unmanned design systems\n\nChuck Eastman is one the earliest and most articulate advocates of what has come to be known as\n\nBuilding Information Modeling. With admirable persistence, Eastman has researched the potential of\n\nrelational databases and object-oriented languages to reconfigure the production of buildings since the\n\nearly 1970s to today, with academic appointments in UCLA, Carnegie Mellon, and more recently at the\n\nCollege of Architecture at Georgia Tech 255 as the director of the \"Digital Building Lab.\" One of his earlier\n\npropositions, for instance, is the Building Descrption System (BDS), a software prototype meant to \"[replace]\n\ndrawings as the primary description for design and construction of buildings.\" 256 Echoing the nascent\n\nparadigm of object-oriented programming, the project's description posits a view of design as the symbolic\n\nmanipulation of assemblages of discrete objects endowed with data attributes: \"an adequate description of\n\na physical system is a specification of a set of elements together with their relative locations and that all\n\nother relations may be identified from these primitives257.\" Like his almost-contemporaries at the Computer-\n\nAided Design Project at MIT258, Eastman sought to define the most flexible and adaptable system imaginable.\n\nHe thus presents the BDS not as a problem-oriented design system, but as a \"general description system,\n\nallowing for definition or alteration of any possible element, and very general analytic and drawing\n\nroutines.\" 259 The BDS was thus equipped \"means to produce drawings of their arrangement and to\n\nanalyze their performances.\" 2 0 As an example of how the system could analyze a design, Eastman\n\nsuggests what today is known as \"clash-detection:\" the \"automatic determination of spatial conflicts\"\n\nresulting in \"a single database useful for communication, analyses, coordination, and fabrication.\" 26'\n\nEastman conceived the system's basic component description as an assemblage of three separate parts: a\n\n255 \"Digital Building Lab @ Georgia Tech: About Us,\" Academic, BIM Resources @ Georgia Tech, n.d.,\nhttp://bim.arch.gatech.edu/content-view.asp?id=509.\n256C. Eastman,J. Lividini, and D. Stoker, \"A Database for Designing Large Physical Systems,\" in Proceedings of the\nMay 19-22, 1975, National Computer Conference and Exposition, AFIPS '75 (New York, NY, USA: ACM, 1975), 603,\nhttp://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1499949.1500073.\n257 Eastman, Lividini, and Stoker, \"A Database for Designing Large Physical Systems.\"\n258 See discussion about the Plex.\n2,9 Eastman, Lividini, and Stoker, \"A Database for Designing Large Physical Systems,\" 603.\n260 Ibid.\n261 Ibid. This kind of analysis is now called \"Clash detection\" or \"Conflict detection\" and is a staple of modern BIM\nsystems.\n\n83\n\n\ntopology, a geonetry, and its attributes. A \"components library\" would store both the system's pre-defined\n\ncomponents, and the user-defined ones. Like modern software, rather than storing a large number of\n\nindependent descriptions, each component \"deployed\" onto the design is a reference to the component's\n\ntemplate in the library [See Figures 21 and 22]. The BDS was written in a system-building language called\n\nBLISS, developed at Carnegie Mellon University -where Eastman was then based. Its size on disk was\n\n120Kb -approximately one fifth of the file size of the Word document containing this dissertation.\n\nEastman understood, like Sutherland, that the users of the system would have to be of a new kind. In a\n\n1977 paper, Eastman speculated about the way in which designers using the system would change and\n\nadapt to the technology:\n\nWhile we do not see designers becoming programmers (or vice versa) overnight,\nwe hope that such a system will allow the naive user to find the system useful with\n\nminimal learning and that as he or she demands more powerful capabilities, they\ncan be easily learned in small increments. We see this as a way of reducing the gap\nbetween these two classes of people. 262\n\nIn 2008, in a guest talk entitled Was Alberti wrong? The Separation between architectural design and construction at\n\nthe MIT Department of Architecture, Chuck Eastman posited the view that Building 1nformation Modeling is\n\nto \"heal\" Alberti's design-construction divide. 26 3 The presentation was an illustration of the same research\n\nprinciples explored in his 1975 BDS project. A software application encodes a building's geometry, zone\n\nregulations, and information about materials and construction, into a single project database. Encoded in\n\nthe database as rules, the building codes and other restrictions can be automatically checked for\n\ncompliance -and therefore help design teams produce a valid design. The information about\n\nconstruction and materials can be used by the system to automatically generate construction documents.\n\nEastman proposed that the system's capacity to encode information about materials, costs and regulations,\n\ncollapsed the Albertian divide between design and construction. As a case study, Eastman's team explored\n\nthe design of federal courthouses 264. The detailed construction documentation produced by the system,\n\nEastman argued, can reduce the need of skilled labor during both design and construction phases, thus\n\n262 Charles Eastman and Max Henrion, \"Glide: a Language for Design Information Systems,\" SIGGRAPH Comput.\nGraph. 11, no. 2 July 1977): 25. For a discussion of the new professional roles emerging around computation and\nsimulation, see Yanni Alexander Loukissas, Co-Designers: Cultures of Computer Simulation in Architecture (New York:\nRoutledge, 2012).\n263 Sixteenth century architect and scholar Gian Battista Alberti spoke of the architect's need for a skilled craftsman\nto execute his designs, establishing a long-standing tradition of separating construction from design work. This\ndivision, historians have argued, has been instrumental for the definition of architects' authority as a social and\nprofessional group. See Chapter 2.\n264 These buildings,' are a convenient exploration for the BIM project because, first, their designs are governed by\nlong manuals of requirements and specifications. Second, they need to be deployed across the entire US territory.\nAlso, they are commissioned by a well endowed patron.\n\n84\n\n\nhelping reduce the US construction industry's dependence on human labor -and, in particular, its\n\nreliance on \"illegal immigrants.\" 265\n\nThe image of a semi-automated construction recalls Coons's idea about \"perfect slaves\" -slavish\n\nservants performing the drudgery of physical labor; mechanical versions of Alberti's skilled craftsman.\n\nEastman's proposition, however, is imagined differently. Instead of Coons's (naf) liberalizing rhetoric of\n\nmechanically supported creativity, Eastman's enacts a managerial desire of efficiency and productivity -\n\nwith an ethno-national component. This desire is enacted by designs being unmannedly deployed into\n\nmaterialized into- the world.\n\nEastman's uniquely focused academic career is an illustration of the enthusiasm that, since the onset of\n\nthe computer age, led engineers and technologically minded architects to re-imagine design practice\n\nthrough computers. In Eastman's technological imagination, design is re-conceptualized as the definition\n\nand manipulation of discrete objects representing architectural elements, and their attributes, in the digital\n\nspace of software. Like Negroponte266, Eastman took issue with the \"fallible\" subjectivity of human\n\ndesigners, but, unlike him, Eastman doesn't seek to coat the effort to remove subjectivity with liberatory\n\ntropes of socio-technological emancipation. Eastman uses instead, unapologetically, scientific managerial\n\ntropes of efficiency, automation, labor costs, and ethno-national political geographies of work. Moreover,\n\nthrough technology, he seeks to establish new forms of professional legitimacy for architects in an\n\nincreasingly uncontested techno-scientific society.\n\nEastman's career-long technological proposition illustrates the convergence, in architecture, of the two\n\ndefining personas of the 20th century: the scientific manager, and the engineer.\n\nDennis Shelden: drawing the boundaries of design\n\nDennis Shelden is a key figure in the development of both Digital Project and Gehry Technologies. Before\n\nobtaining his doctoral degree in Design and Computation from MIT, 267 Shelden obtained degrees in\n\narchitecture and civil engineering. Shelden based his dissertation on his work as a computational specialist\n\nat Frank Gehry's office, Gehry Partners, in Los Angeles. 263 Since the constitution, in 2000, of Gehry\n\nTechnologies as a body independent from Gehry Partners, he has led the firm's technology efforts, combining\n\nthis with a position as an Associate Professor of Practice at the School of Architecture at MIT.\n\n265 Eastman also speculated that this information could even be made \"machine-readable,\" so that robots could put\nthe building together unmannedly.\n266 See previous chapter.\n267 This group also houses my graduate student work and this research.\n268 Dennis R. (Dennis Robert) Shelden, \"Digital surface representation and the constructibility of Gehry's\narchitecture\" (Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2002), http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/l1721.1/16899.\n\n85\n\n\nIn his courses, Shelden has used Digital Project, as well as other software systems, to introduce\n\narchitecture students to mathematical forms of spatial and material description. Instead of using\n\ncomputation as a generative, form-making strategy (a common trend among computational design\n\neducators), Shelden asks students to see computers as instruments to encode and explore the physical\n\nproperties of material systems. His role within Gehry's practice may have informed this pedagogical\n\napproach. In what follows I refer to a conversation with him at MIT, to explore aspects of the\n\ncontemporary theories of design evolving around the digital environments of Building Ifiormation Modeling.\n\nIn the excerpts immediately below, Shelden discusses his first visit to Gehry's office -while still a\n\nstudent- recalling being impressed by the manual work on physical models by the architects. 269\n\nWhen I got out to Gehry's, there was a whole other epiphany that really is\nabout design, and (...) the relationship between design, process, and making. I had\nnever been exposed to that; I had always been exposed to the analysis part (...) I\nknew computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis and all these\nthings, and 3D modeling, and rendering (...) and then you get out there [to\nGehry's office] and they're doing this amazing stuff with materials... 270\n\nDesign is about physical things. 27'\n\n[Software] has absolutely nothing to do with design, but with the\ncommunication of design through the collaboration, through the community.272\n\nHistorically, [software was] not about the design process but about the\nproduction process; everything through documentation of design intent and the\nsatisfaction of code, communication, contractual communication, and then\nrealization and fabrication in the field.273\n\nIn these excerpts, design is identified with the physical exploration of materials, while software is\n\nconstrued as an instrument for the documentation, analysis and simulation of design -activities seen as\n\nperipheral to and supportive of design. Once design is encoded in the software, it is no longer imagined as\n\nan activity, but as information to be processed and circulated through the metaphorical \"pipes\" of digital\n\nnetworks. Crucially, in this \"infrastructure\" theory of design software, the concepts of technology and\n\ndesign are mutually constitutive and exclusionary.\n\n269 Remarking on the sharp contrast between Gehry's form of design practice and his training as an architect,\nengineer and computation expert at MIT.\n270 Dennis Shelden, \"Interview with Dennis Shelden,\" Digital Recording, March 3, 2010.\n271 Ibid.\n272 Ibid.\n273 Ibid.\n\n86\n\n\nThe exclusionary aspect is illustrated nicely in the following excerpt. In it, Shelden describes the role of\n\nGehy Technologies as \"everything but\" design: as a tool to aid the documentation and communication like a\n\nscaffolding274 to create a \"continuity of information\" between disciplines.\n\nGehry Technologies has grown to be sort of the organization that does\neverything but design. We really are about the extended process, and how you use\ntechnology to bridge these different disciplines and create a continuity of\ninformation ... The building process has lots of rich interactions within\norganizations and very thin pipes between them. 27 5\n\nShelden sees the highly idiosyncratic and diverse communicative practices of the building industry as\n\nopportunities to build a more efficient information infrastructure. While the technical practice of Gehy\n\nTechnologies manages the communications infrastructure, design is located within other forms of practice,\n\nincluding physical model-making and drawing. 276 This exclusionary relationship can be understood as an\n\nexpression of the Albertian split between design and construction in the professional and legal cultures of the\n\nAEC industry. While scholars of practice have repeatedly challenged the peripheral location of technical\n\npractice in design discourses, 277 Shelden's discourse shows its practicality for Gehry Technologies: locating\n\ntheir practice in the periphery of design is fundamental to abide by contractual boundaries and cultural\n\nconventions -and perhaps more importantly, for establishing a strong market proposition.\n\n\"Design\" and \"technology\" exist, in this discourse, as mutually constitutive artifacts. In other words, the\n\nboundary between the technical domain of digital information and the material domain of design, helps\n\ndefine both. Prior to its translation into the computer, design is imagined as a tangible material\n\nexploration: a practice. 278 Once this phase is finished, the design is \"frozen\" and re-imagined as an inert\n\nentity requiring documentation, communication, analysis and (finally) materialization. In the dual body of\n\n274 Supportive and external, like a scaffolding. See the scaffold metaphor in the Introduction.\n275 Shelden, \"Interview with Dennis Shelden.\"\n276 In this excerpt, Shelden concisely explains architect's limited role in the economy of construction, and the idea of\ndesign as an additional service: \"There's [design] concept but you don't get paid, that's an additional service right?\nSo there's 20%, 20%, 40%, 20% of the fee, which in aggregate is... about 5% of the construction cost. So, if you\ntake 5% /o so 1% of the total cost of the building is design, right? And 1% is figuring out the systems. And if you look at\nhow architects get paid, right? That's where they get paid. And ... I shouldn't be pejorative, but this is largely\ndocumentation. So this is [points at the doodle in the notebook], this is everything that ... architectural students and\ntheoreticians think architecture does. And this is ... where they actually they get paid. And a lot of times they don't\neven get paid for this.\" Ibid.\n277 See, for instance Lucy Suchman, \"Organizing Alignment,\" Organization, 2000: 311-327. Kathryn Henderson, On\nLine and on Paper: Visual Representations, Visual Culture, and Computer Graphics in Design Engineering, Inside Technology\n(Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 1999). And more recently Loukissas, Co-Designers.\n278 There is a de-coupling of design as both a material and immaterial practice/object. On one hand design can be\nconstrued as something to be communicated via digital representations (that is, as a signifier, or as something for which\nthe digital representation acts as an index). On the other hand design can be construed as the object and practice of\nthe (non-digital) representation itself. Once \"encoded,\" it is imagined, in an information-theoretical tone, as\ninformation.\n\n87\n\n\npractice formed by Gehy Partners and Gehr Technologies, the software Digital Project constitutes the\n\ndisciplinary boundary between the two domains, and the social boundary between those who design and\n\nthose who rationalize, document and communicate the design. 2 9\n\nWhile the stark distinction between design and documentation is enforced by legal and cultural\n\ncontexts, there are moments in which it blurs. During one of his classes, Shelden invited one of his\n\ncolleagues to present a case study -a real project where BIM and Digital Project were used as design and\n\nconstruction coordination methods. In an exchange with his colleague and the class after the lecture,\n\nShelden gave insight into a reconfigured equation in which the boundaries between design and\n\nconstruction are contested and blurred. At the end of the presentation, a question was asked about\n\nwhether there had been a \"feedback loop\" between the design team and the BIM team that resulted in\n\nchanges to the \"original\" design -if the building's shape had changed during the process of \"encoding\"\n\nthe architect's representations 280 into Digital Project. The consultant didn't hesitate: \"there was not a lot of\n\ngoing back and forth, we were just rationalizing the geometry provided by the designers in the design\n\nmodel ... the architect's team was always 'in charge' of the design.\" At this point, Shelden intervened and,\n\npointing to the Digital Project model projected on the wall, said forcefully: \"This is the design: the architect's\n\nmodel is just an intent; a design intent.\"281\n\nBy highlighting the design team's work as \"intent, \"282 Shelden's move refrained both the consultant's\n\nportrayal of their work as \"merely\" technical, and the dualistic (design-construction) frame implicit to the\n\nquestion. Under this view, the technically intensive work of geometric rationalization and workflow\n\nmanagement developed by the BIM team was the \"true\" design -or at least an integral part of it. The\n\nresult of this move is to expand the definition of design to include design's means and methods,283 a forceful\n\nattempt to blur the distinction between the realms of design and construction, or the Albertian Split.284 The\n\neffects of this blurring are a re-definition of the disciplinary boundaries that separate architects and\n\nengineers, and a reconfigured politics of architectural authorship where a technologically enabled\n\ncollective of actors replaces the architect as the sole mastermind. With the move, Shelden colonizes design\n\n-rhetorically at least- for the technical practices of organizations like GT.\n\n279 As shown by Loukissas in a study of simulations at Arup, software systems can serve as instruments of boundary\ndemarcation between professional groups. See Loukissas, Co-Designers.\n280 Typically, drawings and non-BIM digital models.\n281 In the legal language of architectural contracts \"design intent\" refers to a specific stage of the design construction\nprocess where no structural or technical information is present. See [AIA REF].\n282 Design intent is a contractual term referring to the architect's descriptions. Besides its contractual dimension, the\nterm etymologically connotes what is unfinished, embryonic, or projected.\n283 A phrase often used in industry and contracts to refer to the domain of construction.\n284 I discuss this in Chapter 2 by reviewing critical accounts of practice by Cuff, Architecture. and Larson, Behind the\nPostmodern Facade.\n\n88\n\n\nThis redefinition of design deserves special attention, as it contradicts traditional premises of the\n\narchitect's academic training.285 By locating design within the technical practice of BIM's digital\n\ndescriptions, Shelden's move evokes the attitude of nineteenth century US-American architecture culture\n\n-as described byJohnston: a constant negotiation and tension between authorial aspirations and a\n\npragmatist, business ethos. 2 3 These reconfigurations are premised on the centrality and universality of the\n\ntechnological infrastructure of software and process.\n\nThere are thus rich tensions in Shelden's representations of design and technology. While during the\n\nconversation Shelden places technology as an infrastructure for design (\"everything-but design\"), in the\n\nexchange with his colleague in class he identifies it, forcefully, with the design itself (\"this [digital model] is\n\nthe design\"), making a powerful claim about design as an expanded process including stages of\n\ndocumentation, analysis and simulation. The narratives differ in the value they assign to human\n\nsubjectivity. During the class -echoing Eastman and Negroponte- Shelden construes technological\n\nagency as a way of contesting the primacy of the architect as the project's mastermind. In the\n\nconversation, more in tune with the foundational narrative of GT, the subjectivity of the human designer\n\nis at the root of the technological effort: it's because Gehry's unconventional designs have evolved into\n\nculturally relevant artifacts that new technological approaches and solutions are put in place to bring them\n\ninto completion. 287 The duality of the proposition is worthy of notice. It illustrates the transformative\n\ntensions, exerted by technological changes, on the cultural and legal disclosures of architectural\n\npractice.28\n\nThese tensions come into light in the constitution, in 2000, of Gehry Technologies as a separate\n\norganization from Gehry Partners. In the following excerpt, Shelden explains how the managerial\n\nadvantages afforded to Gehry Partners by their innovative approach to software, enabled the architects to\n\ncontrol larger portions of the design and construction process. The increased managerial control brought\n\nthe architects too close to stretching outside the conventional contractual boundaries of their practice:\n\n\"What we were doing as an architecture firm, in terms of defining the process of\nothers, was a very dangerous thing to be doing from a contractual perspective (...)\nit's the (...) architect and means and methods problem, right? So, in order to\n\n285 And in many ways closer to the heteronomous understanding of architecture advocated by critical observers of\narchitecture like Dana Cuff and Magali Larson.\n286 And the subsidiary tensions and debates between building mechanics and architects. I consider this in Chapter 2,\nin particular around the historical account byJohnston, Drafting Culture.\n287 See discussion about the \"organization of the artist\" in Chapter 1.\n288 While the sphere of design is construed as sacred through contractual and cultural taboos, it gives purpose to the\nprofane sphere of technique -a world of \"hard outcomes you can rationalize towards.\" Despite constituting two\ncompanies, Gehry's name and directorship over both Gehry Partners and Gehry Technologies preserves an allure of\nindividual mastery. 288 Metaphorically, body and scaffold, respectively, of architecture.\n\n89\n\n\nimpact what other people were doing we were doing things that, narrowly,\narchitects are not supposed to be doing... \"289\n\nThe constitution of Gehy Technologies illustrates the effects in industry resulting from the organizational\n\ntransformations fostered by the implementation of digital modeling environments and Building Information\n\nModeling systems and processes. 290 Crucially, software's capacity to exert an increased managerial control\n\nexceeds the cultural and contractual roles conventionally attributed to architects. This capacity is\n\nexpressed in the \"infrastructure\" trope outlined above: the notion of technology as both a central hub and\n\ninfrastructure (not as a tool) that distributes and processes design information. A scaffolding for design. In\n\nthe frame below, I discuss Shelden's conceptualization of design \"in\" the software.\n\nDesigning in the software\n\nNot all software systems are explained in terms of infrastructure. Back in our conversation,\n\nother systems appeared to enact a different role. In the following excerpt, Shelden discusses\n\nthe 3-D modeling software Rhinoceros as a better support for design because it enables users to\n\nmanipulate shapes in a way that resembles the manipulation of physical objects in the world.\n\nIn Rhinoceros, a user seeking to model a building component can simply stretch, \"pull and\n\nerase things:\"\n\n\"Most of the software that's out there is not good at all [at enabling design], and parametrics\n\nis particularly bad at that (...) [However] Rhino is very easy to stretch and pull and erase\n\nthings, and add new things, and is a very fluid thing, but parametrics [like Digital Project] is\n\njust awful at that.\" 29 1\n\nThis narrative is an expression of a deeply engrained understanding, in our culture, of design\n\nas a hands-on, unstructured exploration of physical materials: 292 the degree to which a digital\n\nenvironment is able to mimic the manipulation of physical objects in space becomes the key to\n\nthe system's imagined ability to support \"design.\" In contrast, the mechanistic environment\n\nof parametric modeling systems are not \"good for design\" because it only enables users to\n\nmanipulate representations in highly structured ways -distant from the metaphorical clay of\n\nRhinoceros or physical models. 293\n\n289 Shelden, \"Interview with Dennis Shelden.\"\n290 The first decade of the 21Pt century saw the appearance of a large number of consultancies focusing on digital\ndesign information.\n291 This form of operation contrasts with parametric systems where descriptions are the result of a structured,\nhierarchical network of geometric elements and constraints. Shelden, \"Interview with Dennis Shelden.\"\n292 The user interaction metaphor of Rhino is. Authors and researchers like [REF, Killian] have discussed design as\nan \"exploration.\"\n293 The word modeling connotes manual work in a way that other words used to refer to computational design work\ndon't -like simulation. A discussion between me and scholar Yanni Loukissas on the subject was referred to in\nLoukissas, Co-Designers.\n\n90\n\n\nShelden suggests, however, that parametric systems define a different form of flexibility. This\n\nform of design flexibility doesn't stem from digital shapes mimicking the plasticity of physical\n\nmaterials, but from the modeling of geometric and other kinds of constraints made possible\n\nby the structuredness inherent to computational descriptions. 294 Rather than the \"absolute\"\n\nflexibility of clay, the kind of design flexibility afforded by parametric modeling systems\n\ninvokes a constrained space of possible variation: a \"design space.\" 295 The notion of a\n\n\"design space,\" and the questions about the different ways to imagine its exploration, is\n\nnicely captured in the following two excerpts:\n\n\"In a parametric modeling system you are not just creating geometry, you are creating space\n\nof possibility, so, when you do it well, then it's tremendously powerful because it captures all\n\npossible states that you may be interested in, but there's a whole host [of design possibilities]\n\nin other states that you don't capture. And I think that every system is like that (...) So I\n\nguess that, that question about how the state space evolves, and the limits of a particular state\n\nspace (...) And \"Some of the interesting critical thinking about design it's not just about\n\nchanging the state of the design, it's about changing the state of the state-space. As far as I\nknow there's nothing out there that can model sort of the bifurcation of state-spaces in a sort\n\nof an easy fashion, and I think that's a really fascinating question. The Deleuzian question,\nwhich is: How do you capture the topological variance of different state-spaces and then the\n\ncontinuity across those? 29 \"\n\nDesign is itself a plastic concept. Its contemporary definition is inseparable from and contingent upon\n\nthe technological systems we use to inscribe it, communicate it, and document it. In the technical practice\n\nof organizations like Gehry Technologies, the boundaries of design are constantly enforced and redrawn\n\nto explicate different aspects -legal, professional, practical- of practice, illustrating this plasticity.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe software empire\n\nThis chapter has discussed key aspects the Building Information Modeling by analyzing the voices of 3\n\nkey proponents. Also important, I have shown how, unlike the first commercial systems, the ideas behind\n\nBIM closely reflect the design philosophies articulated by the early pioneers in the Computer Aided Design\n\nProject: a reconfigured discourse of design as a computational, technical practice, premised on the accuracy\n\nof structured computational descriptions, and on the centrality and universality of the infrastructures for\n\n294 In previous chapters, I have referred to this structuredness as an \"algorithmic tectonics.\"\n295 For an exploration of this theory of design through constraints see: Kilian, \"Design Exploration Through\nBidirectional Modeling of Constraints.\"\n296 Shelden, \"Interview with Dennis Shelden.\"\n\n91\n\n\nthe circulation of digital information. These aspirations, and the techno-cultural imaginaries they set in\n\nmotion, can be seen as a process of hegemony formation.\n\nTechnology is not \"up for grabs.\" As suggested by the exchange between Witt and the student\n\ndescribed above, and by the transformative tensions revealed by Shelden's conceptualizations of design\n\ntechnology, Building Infornation Modeling, is premised on a techno-social proposition that de-stabilizes a\n\ncrucial narrative in architecture about the primacy of design over construction. 297 This de-stabilization has\n\nthe effect of reducing the professional space of design -traditionally understood as drawing-centered\n\nproject documentation.\n\nIn the remaining three chapters I provide an ethnographic portrait of Building Ifornation Modeling from\n\nthe field. I now turn to critically consider the geographical and political context of these practices, and its\n\nparticipants' use of the tropes of centrality and universality identified above, to make sense of their roles.\n\n297 See Chapter 1.\n\n92\n\n\nPLAN DIMENSIONS\n\nMODULE 5 FT 0 IN\nFLOOR LENGTH 125 FT 0 IN\nFLOOR WIDTH 125 FT 0 IN\nTRAVEL DISTANCE 77.

BUILDERS OF THE VISION\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe social worlds of Building Infornation Modeling I observed exist within the larger contexts of the\n\nCity and Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the Middle East [See Figure 23].\n\nThe geographical, political and social specificity of these contexts is crucial to the subjects of this study -\n\nmostly expatriates from Europe and the region-, their everyday lives, the projects they develop, and the\n\ninstitutional arrangements within which they operate.s 1 Moreover, within these broader contexts, the\n\nsocio-technical practice of BIM is embedded in an evolving culture of architecture production\n\ncharacterized by increasingly large and flexible transnational networks of work enabled by technological\n\nshifts in information technology and travel. Modern self-representations of the State in Abu Dhabi, visible\n\nin advertisements, newspapers and public exhibitions, seek to fashion the emirate's capital as a global\n\nmetropolis and as a hub of business and culture [Figure 24]. This imagined modernity is figured, as\n\nanthropologist Ahmed Kanna has pointed out, as a white European upper class utopia [Figure 25].302\n\nRepresentations of ambitiously iconic architectural projects designed by the world's most famous\n\npractitioners perform symbolically beyond their architectural function as illustrations of the State's\n\ngrandiose vision for the city. Projects bearing the signature of a \"starchitect\"303 are elements of a strategy\n\naimed at giving the city a competitive advantage in a global struggle for the interconnected features of\n\nmedia attention, tourism and investment of capital. 304\n\n301 See Magali Larson on Autonomy and heteronomy. Larson, Behind the Postmodern Facade, 12.\n302 The emphasis on Europe as an identity model in the UAE can be traced historically-it contrasts with a\ndocumented pre-oil identification of the Gulf States with a Pan-Arab ethnical and cultural identity. Kanna, Dubai, the\nCity as Corporation, 24.\n303 Popular media has adopted the term \"starchitects\" to refer to a handful of architects who have have acquired\ninternational fame beyond their profession by practicing globally on high-profile institutional commissions. The term\nis generally considered pejorative by these practitioners, as it portrays them as popular celebrities, rather than as\nrigorous professionals. See for instance \"Frank Gehry: 'Don't Call Me a Starchitect' - Architecture - Arts &\nEntertainment - The Independent,\" The Independent, December 17, 2009, http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-\nentertainment/architecture/frank-gehry-dont-call-me-a-starchitect- 1842870.html.\n304 Kanna calls this \"urban entrepeneuralism\" in the context of \"place wars.\" See Kanna, Dubai, the City as\nCorporation, 80.\n\n98\n\n\nIn this chapter I will seek to illustrate how the socio-technical practice of BIM and the socio-geo-\n\npolitical landscapes of Abu Dhabi are related. To delineate the larger socio-political context of Abu\n\nDhabi, and the place of architecture in it, I will borrow elements from Ahmed Kanna's 305 urban\n\nanthropology, and from the histories of the UAE by Chrisopher Davidson 306 and Frauke Heard-Bey, 307 as\n\nwell as from some recent works in the social sciences that have approached critically the effects of\n\nglobalization in architectural practice -in particular McNeill 3 )08 and Ghirardo.309 I use the work of these\n\nscholars to set an interpretive framework for my observation of Building Information Modeling practice in two\n\nprojects in Abu Dhabi. 310 In this chapter I critically examine the ability of cultural-imperialist critiques to\n\nexplain the contemporary technological production of the built environment.\n\nA visit to the mall\n\nDepaysement\n\nAbu Dhabi, by far the largest State [of the UAE], occupying approximately 87\nper cent of the total UAE territory, owes its character to the desert31 1 .\n\nThe capital of Abu Dhabi, bearing the same name as the State, is also located\n\non an island, which is connected to the mainland by two road bridges. The\n\ntriangular island has about 10 kilometers of waterfront and ex tends for 16\nkilometers towards the mainland between lagoons and other islands. It\n\naccommodates at present most of the capital's administrative and residential\n\nbuildings, including the international gallery complex.3 1 2\n\n305 Kanna, Dubai, the City as Corporation.\n306 Christopher M. Davidson, The United Arab Emirates: A Study In Survival (Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2005).\n307 Heard-Bey, From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates, -.\n308 Donald McNeill, The GlobalArchitect: Finns, Fame and Urban Form (T & F Books US, 2009).\n300 Ghirardo, Out of Site.\n'310 Besides a scholarly tradition of urban studies that seek to understand the links between cities' form and the life of\ncommunities in its political dimension (see for instance J. Jacobs, W.H. Whyte), Kanna and McNeill's arguments can\nrelate also to previous theorizations of the politics of technology. For instance, scholars like Langdon Winner, Lucy\nSuchman and Bruno Latour have sought to unpack the political dimension of technology and artifacts (non-humans)\nby virtue of the way in which their design shapes \"possibilities of action.\" See Lucy Suchman, Human-Aachine\nReconfigurations: Plans and Situated Actions, 2nd ed. (Cambridge University Press, 2006). Langdon Winner, \"Do artifacts\nhave politics?,\" in The whale and the reactor: a search for limits in an age ofhigh technology (Chicago: University Of Chicago\nPress, 1986), 19-39.\n311 Heard-Bey, From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates.\n312 Ibid., 12. In p. 171 Heard-Bey mentions that Abu Dhabi is \"Place (or father of) the white gazelle.\n\n99\n\n\nDriving through the city of Abu Dhabi's Corniche can be a cinematic experience. The long stretch of\n\nskyscrapers of the metropolitan downtown area of Al Khalidiya, and the clear blue water of the Arabic\n\nseaside make for a pleasant drive along the carefully landscaped, palm-lined highway. Westwards, close to\n\nthe Emirates Palace -a former royal residence turned a \"7 star\" hotel with a world-famous gold-vending\n\nmachine- a monumental sign with a photograph of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan with the legend\n\n\"Our Father Zayed\" invites the drivers-and the few pedestrians- to celebrate the deeds of the country's\n\nfounder: \"our father.\" Just a few minutes away, across an artificial peninsula folding itself North as a hook\n\noverlooking the city, is the Marina Mall, an American-style commercial enclave surrounded by a lake of\n\nparking lots and (to the east) a Marina docking several hundred modern yachts. After parking my cheap\n\nrented Toyota (there's no subway or comprehensive bus-system in Abu Dhabi) I made my way under the\n\nlines of white tents shading the cars to the mall's entrance. As I walk through the neutral streets of the mall\n\ntowards the Carrefour supermarket I pass by other shoppers, most of them expatriates who, perhaps like\n\nmyself, feel \"re-countrified\" by the carefully crafted familiarity of the commercial landscape (IKEA,\n\nFuddruckers, a Multiplex -also Chanel, Dior and Armani boutiques) and by the circular predictability of\n\nthe building's layout. Most of the people I walk by look like members of a Western and, to a lesser extent,\n\nSouth Asian middle class. Some are local, distinguishable by their long clothes,313 walking separately in\n\ngendered groups.\n\nAssisted automation\n\nIn order to use a grocery cart in Carrefour, customers have to insert 1 dirham (approximately 1 US\n\nquarter) in a coin slot located in the cart's handling bar. I learn from a sticker placed on the green plastic\n\nof the cart's handle that the coin will be returned once the cart is placed back in the mechanic cart line\n\nlocated close to the Mall's entrance. After doing my shopping and putting the grocery bags in the trunk of\n\nthe car I automatically start taking the cart back to the mechanic line (so I can reclaim my dirham), but I\n\nam gently stopped by a smiling young South Asian man who indicates, with gestures, that he will return\n\nthe cart to the machine. I then realized that no customer returned the cart by herself to the line, and that\n\nSouth Asian boys, distributed around the lot in a quiet swarm, had formed an informal economic\n\nentanglement in the mall as the machine's assistants, or grooms.31 4\n\nLike the space of the Mall, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi represents itself to outsiders as a familiar domain\n\nwhere space articulation and architecture play both symbolic and functional roles. A reductive analogy\n\n313 Kandura (male cloak) and Abaya (female gown).\n314 Parking lot ticket dispensing machines also have human grooms. Assisted automation? REFER to Latour's\ngroom.\n\n100\n\n\ncan be drawn between mall and the State, that illustrates UAE's aspirations to define its own brand of\n\nmodernity premised on the metaphoric notion of a \"bridge\" between the Arab and Western worlds, and\n\nbetween \"tradition\" and \"future.\"3 15 However, while the expatriates navigating the familiar space of the\n\nmall can be thought of as \"flexible citizens,\" defined by Aihwa Ong as individuals taking advantage of\n\n\"the split between state-imposed identity and personal identity caused by political upheavals, migration,\n\nand changing global markets, \"316 the boys in the parking lot are part of a different, less \"flexible\" reality\n\nwhich complicates the intended progressiveness of the State's vision, and the technological and social\n\nscaffoldings that are deployed for the production of its built environments.\n\nAbu Dhabi\n\nA fatherly state\n\nWithout delving too deeply in UAE's fascinating and complex history of colonialism, tribal rule, and\n\nthe current family-state, it's important to note the way in which the wealth derived from the oil findings in\n\nthe 1970s enabled ruling dynastic elites-the Maktoums (Dubai) and the Al Nayhans (Abu Dhabi3 7)- to\n\nconsolidate their absolute mandate over the country through what is conventionally known as the \"ruling\n\nbargain.\" Scholars commonly understand such bargain as a direct exchange of welfare benefits and\n\nvaluables (housing, education, large forgivable loans), for the political demobilization of critical voices -\n\ntypically from a merchant class- that brought the rulers' mandate into question.318 Historian of the UAE\n\nChristopher Davidson, for instance, explains the \"ruling bargain\" in Abu Dhabi as a transformation of\n\nresources into (absolute) political power: if Abu Dhabi's Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan \"could\n\noversee the efficient distribution of wealth to [indigenous] families and individuals, and not just spend on\n\nlarge scale development projects, then the sheikhdom's lucrative natural resources could be effectively\n\ntransmuted into his own personal generosity, thereby rendering the population eternally grateful for his\n\nmunificence. 3 19\" The effect of the consolidation of the Sheik's mandate was thus not so much a bargain\n\nbut the success of an ethno-nationalist, authoritarian and anti-reformist project of state-building. Crucial\n\ntenets of this project were, on one hand, paternalistic oil-funded policies designed to de-incentivize\n\n315 See a discussion about Abu Dhabi's iconic enactments of energetic futures in: Gokce Gunel, \"Preparing for an\nOil-less future: Energy, Climate Change and Green Business in Abu Dhabi\" (Ph.D., Cornell, 2012).\n16 Aihwa Ong, Flexible Citizenship: The Cultural Logics of Transnationality (Duke University Press Books, 1999), 3.\n317 These elites originally fashioned by British imperialism to simplify its control over trading and strategic interests.\n31 Kanna writes that \"Oil and the ruling bargain certainly expanded the material welfare of Emiratis, but the\ndiscourses of many Emiratis suggested a constriction of political horizons.Kanna, Dubai, the City as Corporation, 25.\n319 Davidson, The United Arab Emirates, 52.\n\n101\n\n\npolitical engagement; and on the other, a representational politics of the state geared towards construing\n\nitself as a fatherly benefactor protecting its citizens (and foreigners of a certain class and racial\n\nbackground). The boundaries of this welfare state are thus strongly tied to a notion of citizenship based on\n\nhereditary ethnic privilege. 320\n\nPerfect (South-Asian) slaves\n\nUp until the 1960s the local population in the Gulf countries was heavily involved in the harsh labors\n\nassociated with oil production. In the 1970s, with the independence from the British, the UAE started to\n\nbring temporary migrant workers in large numbers to do the hard labors of the construction and oil\n\nindustries. With the benefits of the oil economy, the Emirati local population went to occupy managerial\n\nand government positions, and their participation in the construction workforce (as well as in all primary\n\nand service sectors of the economy) decreased to an almost negligible percentage. They were replaced,\n\nfirst, by Middle Eastern workers coming from Lebanon, Egypt, and, more recently, by South Asian\n\nworkers from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. 321 These workers now face conditions which, according to\n\npolitical scientist Adam Hanieh \"you can't describe by anything more than a very severe exploitation\n\nresembling in many cases forms of slavery...\" Hanieh goes on to point out a crucial contrast between the\n\nrealities of labor and Abu Dhabi's architectural exuberance: \"These projects, these fanciful projects, are\n\nbuilt on the back of construction workers that face very severe kinds of exploitation.\" 322 As Kanna\n\nreminds us, these \"cities do not 'emerge from the sand overnight' without huge, expendable armies of\n\nworkers lacking any claim to protection from the state.\" 323 In a series of reports Human Rights Watch has\n\nkept pressure on the UAE government to oversee more closely the companies hiring migrant workers.\n\nThe most recent report, from March 2012, documents how despite certain improvements in labor\n\nconditions for migrants many remain unprotected. The abuses by the employers reported by HRW\n\ninclude misinforming the workers about the terms of the contract, \"indebtedness of recruitment fees paid\n\nto obtain their jobs in the UAE ... illegal salary deductions, in some instances overcrowded and\n\n320 Not unlike European countries like (to my knowledge) Switzerland and Germany.\n321 According to the (conservative) estimate of the U.S. Department of State, migrants from India, Pakistan and\nBangladesh amount to 40/o of the total population of the country. U.S. Department of State Bureau of Near Eastern\nAffairs, \"United Arab Emirates,\" US. Department of State, December 29, 2011,\nhttp://wvw.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5444.htm. It's important to note that South Asian labor is not, however,\nhomogeneously devoted to hard labors and an increasingly number of South Asian \"flexible citizens\" occupy\nconsultant and engineering positions. Neha Vora's anthropological work cited in Kanna: \"middle class Dubai South\nAsians enact two simultaneous and contrasting identities, as global neoliberal participants in a free-market economy\nand as a disenfranchised racial group.\" Kanna, Dubai, the City as Corporation, 36.\n322 Adam Hanieh, \"Modern Slavery in Gulf Countries,\" Video (youtube), May 14, 2011,\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=playerembedded&v=4D_O3tU3Vss.\n323 Kanna, Dubai, the City as Corporation, 27.\n\n102\n\n\nunhygienic housing conditions\" 24 and, disturbingly, the custody of the worker's passport by their\n\nemployers, therefore impeding the worker's freedom of movement [Figures 26 and 27].325 The voices of\n\nthe migrants are not audible in the HRW reports or in the media.326 These conditions have been noted by\n\nother pressure groups and independent bodies, including a New York based group of more than 130\n\nartists, curators and writers who in 2011 started a boycott of the Abu Dhabi Guggenheim by collectively\n\nrefusing to participate in any of the museum's activities until conditions for migrant workers were radically\n\nimproved. A statement posted in their website succinctly asserted that\n\nArtists should not be asked to exhibit their work in buildings built on the backs\nof exploited workers. Those working with bricks and mortar deserve the same\nkind of respect as those working with cameras and brushes.3 27\n\nThe Mall-scape\n\nWhile in the Mall-scapes and gated communities of Abu Dhabi the reality of segregation is only\n\ntangentially visible in the formal and informal economies of service, in the construction sites I frequented\n\nduring my fieldwork3 28 I was able to witness aspects of the heavy restrictions to which members of the\n\nwork force were subjected: workers' movements were constrained by their inability to get driver's licenses,\n\nthe inaccessibility of public transport, the meager salaries, and the different hiring company's frequent\n\nconfiscation of their passports. As a result of the above most laborers rarely visit places different from their\n\nlabor camp and the construction site. Long lines of workers lining up to board the company's bus were a\n\n324 Two Human Rights Watch reports focus on the issue: Human Rights Watch, \"The Island of Happiness:\" Exploitation\nof Aigrant Workers on Saadiyat Island, Abu Dhabi, May 2009,\nwww.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/uae0509webwcover_4.PDF. And Human Rights Watch, The Island of\nHappiness Revisited: A Progress Report on Institutional Commitments to Address the Abuses of Migrant Workers on Abu Dhabi's\nSaadiyat Island, March 2012, http://www.hrw.org/reports/2012/03/21/island-happiness-revisited.\n325 The tolerance of local authorities with these practices may derive from a historical reliance of Emirati economy\non slave labor. Despite British colonists' opposition to slave trade, the commerce of pearl and domestic slaves from\nBaluchistan (Pakistan), Persia (Iran) and Africa, was common until the late 1930s. It was the changing economic\nconditions-the decline of the pearl economy and not humanitarian concerns-what, according to Frauke Heard-\nBey, officially ended the slave traffic in the 20,h century. In her 1982 book \"From Trucial States to United Arab\nEmirates\" Heard-Bey provides an unparalleled picture of the country's history. It is worth noting, however, that in\nher treatment of the issue of slavery she abides by the still common today trope that despite the harsh conditions they\nare sometimes subjected to, slaves are, in relative terms, better as slaves than in their countries of origin.\n326 A recent literary exception is the novel by Indian authors Benyamin &Joseph Koyippally (Tr.), Goat Days\n(Penguin Books, 2012).\n327 Human Rights Watch, \"UAE: Artists Boycott Guggenheim-Abu Dhabi: Protesting Exploitation of Foreign\nMigrant Workers\", n.d., http://www.hrw.org/news/201 1/03/1 7/uae-artists-boycott-guggenheim-abu-dhabi.\n328 And from my very privileged role as a consultant.\n\n103\n\n\ncommon sight at the end of every workday. The deserted highways temporarily crowded by lines of small\n\nbuses occupied by invariably male329 passengers, taking them back to their cities behind fences.330\n\nThe aspired modernity of the State is thus problematic, at least, from the standpoint of the conventional\n\nideals of Western democracy. The alluring urban visions of the UAE -as well as its status as tax-free\n\nconsumerist paradise- coexist with and are made possible by the explicit exclusion of racial and\n\neconomic groups from the benefits awarded to \"flexible citizens.\" The nature of this exclusion can in\n\nmany cases amount to systematic exploitation and -according to critics like Hanieh- slavery. Critics of\n\nthis arrangement consider it ironic that the UAE's shiny infrastructure, predicated on the notions of\n\nmodernity, progressiveness and (more recently) sustainability331 is effectively being built by an underclass\n\nof people whose rights are severely restricted compared to those of the locals and privileged foreigners.\n\nThe following passage on Dubai can also describe Abu Dhabi.\n\n... its immense enclaves and daring buildings seem to represent a progressive\nvision and futuristic orientation for the city (...) but New Dubai is, I argue, a\ntypical urbanist project, governed by an exclusionary, ethnocratic logic that in fact\nstrongly resonates with conservative discourses. The irony is that urbanists such as\n\nstarchitects see themselves as global actors, generally unencumbered by local\nbaggage. In reality (...) the more recent examples of architectural whimsy,\nresonate with and reinforce local hegemonies and structures of racial and class\n\nexclusion 3 .\n\nFollowing on Kanna's notion of the post-industrial capitalist city as a site of \"symbolic processes of\n\nculture and political processes of hegemony,\" and as a scenario of \"labor flexibility, capital mobility, a\n\ncrisis of profit accumulation and a consequent retrenchment of elite economic interests,\" Abu Dhabi and\n\nDubai's politics not only manifests in the abstract legal frameworks that regiment labor and define the\n\nboundaries of citizenship, but also through the city's physical form and architecture. 333 The labor camps\n\nwhere migrant workers live are away from the city centers and out of sight from the Mall-scape.334 The\n\n3D By 2010 the population of the UAE was 70% male. Rem Koolhaas et al., Volume 23: Al Manakh Gulf Continued, ed.\nAIMO et al. (Archis, 2010).\n330 For a review of spatial segregation in the US see\n331 A recent anthropology dissertation by Gokce Gunel interrogates the constitution of an imaginary of Emirati\nprogress and iconicity associated with energy sustainability and green business. See: Gunel, \"Preparing for an Oil-\nless future: Energy, Climate Change and Green Business in Abu Dhabi.\"\n332 Kanna, Dubai, the City as Corporation, 38.\n333 It's important to note that, as Kanna reminds us, there is a danger in conceiving of these spatial manifestations of\npower as prescriptive of human relations. Citizens and expatriates use cities, much as in literary theory, to\nreconstruct meanings of their own through interpretation, conceiving urban space as an open-ended field of urban\nand human relations. Kanna adapts this notion of open-endedness from literary-theory to spatial analysis. In\nparticular conceptions of interpretation and analysis of work in Erdreich and Rappaport.\n334 With this term I refer to the spatial complexes of malls, gated communities, and other expatriate enclaves.\n\n104\n\n\nlaborers, who are not allowed driving licenses 335, are thus effectively segregated from large portions of the\n\ncity's life. Or rather, Abu Dhabi's urban life is fragmentary, composed of radically different kinds of\n\nexperience. Such is the tangible urban expression of the \"ruling bargain. 336\"\n\nI have taken a critical look at the city of Abu Dhabi beyond its self-representation as a modern and\n\nprogressive metropolis, and looked at aspects of its urban form as disclosures and enactments of power\n\nrelations, as part of Abu Dhabi's -to use Kanna's term- \"representational politics 337.\" With this, I have\n\nsketched the larger social and urban context in which the technological practices of architectural\n\nproduction I observed are inscribed. In the following section I will adopt an architectural perspective\n\nthrough my subjects and other sources of ethnographic insight to interrogate the architect's confrontation\n\nwith Abu Dhabi's particular social and political context -as a way to understand this particular world of\n\npractice.\n\nThe architects' bargain\n\nBeautiful things\n\n(...) the UAE is a quite an amazing place because you work with all the\ndifferent nationalities from all over the world and you build amazing structures.\nIt's a dream for an architect and for an engineer to be able to work here because\nthere are budgets available that allow you to build things that are quite amazing.\n\nThe quote is an excerpt from an interview with Bernd Lutz, 33\nB a tall German architect and engineer in\n\nhis early forties. Despite being trained both as an architect and engineer Bernd preferred the intensity of\n\nconstruction sites to the relative calm of a designer's desk.

His description of the UAE as an architect's \"dream\" is illustrative\n\nof a common sentiment among members of the design and construction communities, who see the oil-rich\n\nEmirate as a mecca of contemporary practice because of large budgets, big paychecks, and the\n\nopportunity to work on \"amazing projects.\" In the following excerpt Bernd explains how the country's\n\nwealth supports \"beauty\" in architecture and \"prowess\" in engineering.\n\nI think, as an architect in this part of the world, compared to back home, back\nhome the labor is more expensive than the materials, here the materials are more\n\nexpensive than the labor. So, there are big budgets for materials. So if you want\n\nand if you like gold plated ceilings or if you like nice marbles or if you like mother\nof pearl tiles or... there are budgets for these kinds of finishes here, and it is\namazing to build beautiful things! And to build beautiful things the budget needs\nto be there, and it is here. So that as an architect. As an engineer, OK the\nexamples are there, the Burj Dubai, the tallest structure of the world...\n\nFor Bernd, the fact that in Abu Dhabi labor is cheaper than materials is not problematic. It is in fact\n\nregarded as an welcome circumstance affording architects and engineers the freedom to make\n\npropositions that wouldn't be feasible in other parts of the world. Two aspects of Bernd's statement are\n\nimportant for our purposes: First, it illustrates the architectural side of the \"ruling bargain:\" by sponsoring\n\ncreative freedom the UAE regime is able to attract what Deyan Sudjic calls -wittingly but\n\nhyperbolically- the \"flying circus of the perpetually jet-lagged\"339 elite of architectural stardom. As\n\nbefore in UAE's (and in fact, global capitalist) history, financial conditions pave ways for eased\n\nconsciences. The second aspect to note, the transparency with which he acknowledges a classic\n\nprofessional delimitation between the fields of architecture and engineering. In his account the architects\n\nare concerned with finishes and surfaces -the beautiful, while engineers are concerned with structures-\n\nthe firm. Moreover, Bernd construes Abu Dhabi as a temporary place of moral and cultural self-\n\nimprovement.\n\nMulti-culturalism as managerial advantage\n\nEverybody who works here is here to better themselves in a certain way and\nthey are here, I think most of the people, or all of the people, are here, to work\nhere for a certain period and then go back to wherever they come from. So that\ngives a certain dynamism to this place that the people who come here are here to\nwork. And they're here to work hard, and they want to do their best, and then go.\n\n339 In his book \"The Edifice Complex\" Sudjic narrates the architect's historical dependence on power (often an\nauthoritarian state), as a manifestation of \"power, glory, and spectacle.\" See Sudjic, The Edifice Complex, 317.\n\n106\n\n\nSo uhm, in that way, for me as a project manager it is easier to work than for\ninstance working in Libya or in Egypt, because you're working with people who\nare willing to work and who want to work. In other countries you work with local\npeople who are sometimes, first of all, they are in their country and you are the\nforeigner and is sometimes more difficult to be in a position of authority when you\nare working with other people.\n\nBernd finds it easier to exert his professional authority in a culturally diverse team than in more\n\nhomogenous environments with more established conventions of professional practice. However, not\n\neveryone shares his view on the managerial advantage of multi-culturalism. BJ34 0 is a 30-year-old architect\n\nfrom China who works as a design and construction coordinator in the Mall for a French consultancy firm\n\nusing BIM. She got her architectural education and first professional experiences in Australia. In contrast\n\nwith Bernd, BJ (who has to work with a very diverse group of subcontractors on a daily basis) feels that the\n\ncultural diversity makes her BIM design coordination work more difficult because of the different\n\nlanguages, and cultures of representation and work.\n\nSo I think this is the reality of this project ... this place is very complex\nbecause... Maybe you have to understand Hindi! I don't know, or the Indian\nconstruction culture to, to, if you want to engage the construction process.\nBecause there's so many different... What I talk about understanding the cultures\nis that, coming from Australia, it's a very insular kind of industry, so people will\nunderstand each other. The builders understand the architects, there's\nunderstanding ... because they've been working together and they only work with\neach other! There's no external laborers, or external... expats [clear reference to\nthe UAE context], it's mainly just a very pure Australian society, which allows you\nto have kind of an innate understanding of [how] the process works, but elsewhere\nit's more challenging to get.\n\nHer frustration transfers to her use of BIM as a tool for coordination. In the following excerpt she notes\n\nthe varied responses to technology in her coordination work.\n\nThere are so many different kinds of people in this project, different\nbackgrounds, different ways of working, different personalities, and um, some\npeople really want to work with BIM, some people don't, or appropriate it for\ntheir own means, they use it when they want it and ignore it when they don't but\nyou can't do that, yes, if you ignore it you cannot get of it what you need. So, um,\nI don't know if it would be different if I had worked in a more mono-cultural\nenvironment.\n\n340 A pseudonym is used to protect the anonymity of the subject.\n\n107\n\n\nDespite the fact that the working conditions of the migrant laborers were hard to miss, mobile\n\nconsultants like BJ and Bernd generally avoid discussing them. Bernd, in fact, sees the availability of\n\nextremely cheap labor as positive, and highlights the effect of this economy on the affordability of\n\nmaterials for creating \"beauty\" and \"amazement.\" Notably, Bernd represents the existing income and\n\ncultural differences as managerial advantages.34l In contrast, for BJ, cultural differences were a managerial\n\nproblem because of the difficulties to communication during BIM coordination. That's why, in her work\n\nas a coordinator, she conceived of BIM as a \"common language\" for design and construction-even\n\nsuperseding the natural languages of the members. 342 Bernd and BJ are \"flexible citizens,\" 343 skilled\n\nprofessionals moving across national boundaries through networks of corporate practice and towards hubs\n\nof capital flow. Clearly apart from the laborers, they belong344 to a group of expatriates who benefit from\n\nthe \"rush\" of qualified professionals ushered by Abu Dhabi's well-funded drive towards the construction\n\nof iconic projects seeking to put the city \"on the map.\"\n\nImporting the Bilbao effect\n\nThe city of Abu Dhabi exemplifies a global era in which architectural iconicity is understood as a\n\ntrigger of economic development. Magali Larson, for instance, discusses the politics of urban investment\n\nand real-state boom of the 1970s and early 1980s in the US that spurred a competition between cities and\n\nthe rise of architecture as a gentrifying agent in American society. 345 However, in its contemporary form,\n\nthe search for iconicity features a distinctive set of characteristics: the dominance of architectural\n\nrepresentations in digital media, the globally competitive \"place wars\" for tourism and investment of\n\ncapital, and the status of the architect as an all-year round traveler and international media-celebrity. The\n\nemergence of this kind of \"urban-entrepreneurship\" is commonly traced to The Guggenheim Museum in\n\nBilbao, Spain -designed by Frank Gehry and finished in 1997. This building is credited for having\n\nattracted flows of tourism and money that rescued the deindustrialized 346 Basque Country city from\n\n341 There are different attitudes towards authoritarianism. Alain Raynaud is a French architect who works as a \"task-\nforce\" manager in the construction of the Thomas Wynne Mall. As his contract comes to an end he was seeking for\najob. He eventually declined an offer to work for the president of Congo because he was worried how \"that would\nlook in his CV\" once he returned to France because of the regime's HR reputation. This shows how, for Raynaud,\nthe UAE has been successful in maintaining a public image of relative modernity despite the criticisms.\n342 This ambition, of BIM as a \"common language,\" and the subsidiary notion of the projects in the Middle East as\n\"Babel Towers\" is frequently echoed by members of the BIM consultancies. Also, by international standards\nconsortia. It is in fact one of BIM's main tenets. I will explore this in more detail in the next chapter.\n343 Ong, Flexible Citizensiip.\n344 As I myself belonged for a period of one year.\n34 See Larson, Behind the Postmodern Facade, 80.\n346 \"The term deindustrialization suggests the effect of different movements of capital in search of higher profits. It\nrefers to the 'runaway shop' phenomenon-the decision by industrial firms to leave the nation's more mature\n\n108\n\n\neconomic decay. The building inaugurated an era, roughly spanning the decade between its construction\n\nin 1997 and the economic crisis of 2007, during which iconic projects were conceived as triggers of urban\n\ndevelopment and key commodities for cities aspiring to a global \"brand.\" By virtue of an exceptional\n\ndesign that puts a city \"on the map,\" the logic goes, tourism activates the local economy and rescues a city\n\nfrom decay. This phenomenon, which involves city governments, ambitious plans for cultural\n\ninfrastructures, and \"starchitects,\" has become known, to Gehry's irritation, as the \"Bilbao Effect.\" In an\n\ninterview with David Sheff for Playboy, Frank Gehry discusses the \"Bilbao Effect\" and speaks suggestively\n\nof architecture's role in society.\n\nIt's not new. The Bilbao effect is the Parthenon effect. The Chartres Cathedral\neffect. The Notre Dame effect. The press labeled it The Bilbao effect, I didn't\n\nname it. It's nothing new that architecture can profoundly affect a place,\nsometimes transform it. It's like architecture and any art can transform a person,\neven save someone. It can for children - for anyone. It still does for me.3 47\n\nMcNeill suggests that \"the power of the icon as architectural discourse is reliant on the intensified\n\ncirculation of visual images, combined with an embodied, performed set of tourist practices on the part of\n\narchitects and their professional critics and journalists.\"3 48 The architectural object becomes, even before\n\nits construction into a powerful vehicle of an urbanist vision (in the Kanna/Lefebvre sense) through the\n\nwidely circulated images with which it is promoted.349 Current web-based social networking and\n\ntelecommunications intensify the speed and effectiveness of these transactions.3 50\n\nWhile many cities have sought the \"Bilbao Effect,\" perhaps no city illustrates the faith of a local elite in\n\nits benefits better than Abu Dhabi -where billions of dollars are invested in ambitious urban utopian\n\nvisions, and the world's most famous architects have been summoned to design it. The scale of\n\ninterventions planned for the Emirate is in fact striking. Saadiyat Island, located 10 miles to the East of\n\nAbu Dhabi's center, is the site of an ambitious urban development project depending on the Abu Dhabi\n\nTourism Authority (ADTA), through the Tourism Development Investment Company (TDIC) [See\n\nFigure 28]. The plan comprises an assortment of \"starchitectural\" works including a culture district with a\n\nbranch of the Guggenheim Museum designed by Gehry Partners, a branch of the Louvre museum\n\ndesigned by AteliersJean Nouvel, a Performing Arts Center designed by Zaha Hadid, the Sheik Zayed\n\nNational Museum designed by Foster and Partners, and a New York University Campus, designed by\n\nindustrial regions for domestic or foreign areas that offer cheaper facilities, cheaper labor, lower unionization rates,\nand more complacent local governments.\" See Ibid., 68.\n347 Sheff, \"Interview: Frank Gehry.\"\n3 IMcNeill, The GlobalArchitect.\n349 Of the urbanist broadly understood as a cultural entrepreneur.\n350For a critical discussion on the \"Bilbao Effect\" see McNeill, The GlobalArchitect.\n\n109\n\n\nRafael Vifioly. Outside the tiny island other projects constituting the global vision include Al Raha Beach,\n\nthe Central Market (Designed by Norman Foster's office), the Yas Island touristic complex, comprising a\n\nFormula One Circuit and a hotel designed by Asymptote, a Ferrari Theme Park designed by Benoy, the\n\nThomas Wynne Mall Abu Dhabi designed by AEDAS, and Masdar City, an ambitious green-building\n\nurban project master-planned by Foster and Partners [Figure 29].351 The construction of these other\n\nprojects is overseen by Aldar properties, an organ that depends (like most of Abu Dhabi's construction) on\n\na centralized structure of funding that is ultimately controlled by Abu Dhabi's crown prince H.H. General\n\nSheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Through the construction of these \"starchitect\" projects the\n\nEmirate's rulers seek to build Abu Dhabi into a sophisticated global metropolis. 352 However, the\n\nambitious vision seems still distant from reality. Many of the wide highways of Yas and Saadiyat Islands\n\nremain empty -mostly inhabited by camera radars that keep the few driver's speeds in check (an\n\nillustration of the country's heavy policing on its inhabitants)- connecting a still sparse network of hotels,\n\ntouristic attractions and gated residential communities for expatriates and locals. Only a few of the\n\nprojects listed above are built, and most of the iconic ones -including the museums- are un-built,\n\ndelayed or indefinitely suspended. 353 The monumental road infrastructure is in place, awaiting an\n\nuncertain future demand. While the immense oil-wealth of Abu Dhabi shielded it from the devastating\n\neffects the 2007 global financial meltdown had in the neighboring emirate of Dubai,354 the investment\n\npace slowed significantly. At the time of my fieldwork pushed deadlines, delayed contracts, and an\n\natmosphere of uncertainty loomed over the project teams.\n\nConclusion\n\nSelf-expression and (non) politics\n\nIn this chapter I have presented aspects of the geographical, social and political contexts of architectural\n\nproduction in the UAE and reflected on the ways in which actors involved confront them. To do this I\n\n351 See Gunel, \"Preparing for an Oil-less future: Energy, Climate Change and Green Business in Abu Dhabi.\"\n352 In contrast with the more hedonistic Dubai, Abu Dhabi wants to portray itself as a capital of culture. Hence the\nmuseums and cultural infrastructure. Dubai and Abu Dhabi wish to be seen as \"world class\" in different ways.\n353 A common delaying tactic consists in that after a tendering process has finished, the client re-issues the project for\ntender, forcing the interested companies to do a new (cheaper) bid for the project. This tactic has been used in key\nprojects such as the Al Rabiya Gallery Complex and in the Abu Dhabi Louvre (2012).\n354 Dubai's economy, more reliant on financial markets than Abu Dhabi's, suffered dramatically with the 2007\nglobal economic downturn. A NYTimes story famously recorded how laid-off foreigners abandoned their cars at the\ngallery complex to escape the crisis. Robert F. Worth, \"Laid-Off Foreigners Flee as Dubai Spirals Down,\" News,\nNTTimes.con, February 11, 2009,\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/middleeast/ 12dubai.html?pagewanted-all.\n\n110\n\n\nhave brought together realities that rarely co-exist: the glossy world of urbanists' visions of Abu Dhabi and\n\nthe less glamorous realities of the context of its production. I have sought to ground these critiques in the\n\ncontext of architectural and city production in Abu Dhabi, to complicate it as a terrain of multiple\n\ninterests exceeding the professional spaces and discourses of architects and engineers. I have paid special\n\nattention to social and critical perspectives on the production of the built environment.\n\nAbu Dhabi and Dubai critics have focused on the ways in which architectural projects enact a\n\n\"representational politics\" aimed at legitimizing UAE's \"ruling bargain\" and the ethno national regime of\n\npower it indexes. Fair or not, this criticism is useful to highlight a conflict between the progressiveness of\n\narchitects -who often celebrate democratic values, individual self-expression, and freedom-s55 and their\n\nrole as service professionals. Frank Gehry, for instance, describes himself in an interview as\n\n... a do-gooder liberal, because that's why you go into architecture, at least I did\n-to do things for people. I think most of us are idealists. You start out that way\nanyway. I didn't have any interest in doing rich people's homes; I still don't.3 56\n\nAnd discusses architecture as a form of self-expression and individual freedom, attributing it political\n\nsignificance.\n\nThere's a drive in us to express ourselves in some way or form. We pick up\nwhatever material's available. It's primitive. Kids see sand on the beach and build\nand show their parents: \"Look what I did, mama.\" It's necessary to us. Some\ncultures tried to stop people from expressing themselves. In China, for example,\nunder Mao the Communists tried to stop individual expression. For them the\npayoff was a society of equality. The problem, of course, is that it didn't work.\nUltimately you can't repress individuality, even though you can try. People may\nlive and work in uninspiring environments, but look inside them. Look at the\npainted walls. Look at the decorations. People rebel even in the most controlled\noffice environment where you're not allowed to do anything and yet you'll see the\nlittle bulletin board in front of a person's desk and it has their photos and clippings\nand cartoons and whatever else.3 57\n\nMoreover, according to Laurence Chollet,358 one of the reasons Gehry dropped out of the Harvard\n\nUrban Design program before finishing his degree was that, during a meeting, one of his professors\n\ndiscussed his \"secret\" commission to design the palace of right-wing Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.3 59\n\n355 Gehry:\" Sheff, \"Interview: Frank Gehry.\"\n356 Ibid.\n357 Ibid.\n358 See Chollet, The Essential Frank 0. Geir, 112. .\n3Y9 Before being overthrown by the Cuban Revolution Batista was Cuba's leader in two periods: 1940-1944 and\n1952-1959.\n\nIl1\n\n\nDespite discussing his work as a representation of democratic values and individual freedom, Gehry's own\n\npragmatic response to the criticisms about his recent oil-rich monarchic clients seeks to reinforce the\n\narchitect's role as a service provider, as someone who doesn't get to choose his clients. Gehry construes\n\nhimself as an architectural version of Ong's flexible citizen: a free agent engaged in self-expression, instead\n\nof a political actor.360 Is this apparent disengagement with politics perhaps a condition of professionalism?\n\nThe issue of Gehry's politics comes up in an informal conversation with a member of the firm.\n\nDiscussing how critical voices in the left have come to see Gehry's work as a symbol of architects'\n\ncomplicity with \"predatory\" capitalist practices he asked simply \"Why would people criticize Gehry for\n\nbeing a capitalist if he exists within a capitalist system?\" 361\n\nThe architects Frank Gehry and our very own Bernd Lutz seem unaware of the political spheres within\n\nwhich they operate. Their dependence on their clients' commissions to do their work may be part of the\n\nexplanation. For the architects, figuring themselves as service providers, questioning such arrangement is\n\nnot only outside their scope but also against their interests. 362\n\nIt's almost certain, for instance, that Bernd Lutz is aware of the harsh reality faced by workers in his\n\nproject, and yet he chooses to protect himself by discussing the social context of Abu Dhabi in an entirely\n\npositive light. He may fear that if clients have access to his statements, it may jeopardize his position. 363\n\nBJ, on the other hand, sees problems in the communication with workers, but only those that affect her\n\nprofessionally. When asked more directly about the issue, both abided by widely circulating\n\nrationalizations about labor in the UAE positing, among other things, that even though living conditions\n\nare not \"very good,\" migrantsfreey chose to be there. Subsidiary rationalizations are, first, that migrants\n\nare better off in the UAE than in their home countries, and second, that \"they can leave whenever they\n\nwant.\" However, as this chapter records, different kinds of evidence contradict these conceptions. 364 The\n\nhistorical reticence of architects like Gehry, BJ, and Lutz, to embrace the difficult questions posed by the\n\npolitical context of their practice has led scholars like Margaret Crawford to posit the impossibility of a\n\n\"critical\" practice of architecture.365 Architects' dependence on clients and capital, the criticism goes,\n\nimpedes the independence criticality demands. However, while architecture \"provides the most effective\n\n360 From a comment by Lucy Suchman.\n361 From an informal conversation in Abu Dhabi.\n362 A much quoted Upton Sinclair expression says \"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his\nsalary depends upon his not understanding it! Upton Sinclair, I, Candidatefor Governor: And How I Got Licked (University\nof California Press, 1994).\n363 Despite consent and acknowledgement that all interviews would be anonymized.\n364 In a demolishing social critique of the profession, Ghirardo [RE-CHECK] suggests that this is a result of elite\narchitect's egotistic concern with \"experimental\" agendas related to their design process -an attitude echoed by\nBernd Lutz's fascination with the \"amazing\" and \"beautiful\" designs permitted by the conditions of the UAE.\nGhirardo, Out of Site.\n365 See \"Can Architecture Be Socially Responsible?\" In Ibid. Also, Victor Margolin, ie Politics of the Artficia: Essays\non Design and Design Studies, 1st ed. (University Of Chicago Press, 2002).\n\n112\n\n\nsymbolic expression of the state's presence,\" 366 it's important to note that architects are not alone, nor are\n\nthey the crucialplayers, in its planning and deployment. Instead, a diverse group of professionals is\n\nresponsible for the shaping of cities like Abu Dhabi. Kanna describes this group as\n\n... the intersection between local elites (the family-state and allied landlords,\ndevelopment firms, and various official and quasi-official technocrats and\nintelligentsia who share the family-state's and developers spatial ideology) and\ntransnational actors such as journalists, academics, and, not least, architects who\nwork in the UAE. All of these might be called, after Gramsci, traditional\nintellectuals, manipulators, and disseminators of hegemonic representations, in\nthis case of urban space.\" 367\n\nHeteronomy\n\nCritical accounts of contemporary architecture concerned with its elicitation of the socio-political\n\nconsequences of \"ruling bargains\" -and with the obfuscation of the ugly aspects of its coming-to-being-\n\nshould thus acknowledge the complexity of actors and economic forces involved in its production.\n\nSimplistically seeing architecture as a mere driver or neutral expression of such forces respectively\n\nreinforces myths of architectural autonomy and negates architecture's own socio-material specificity.\n\nThe schism between the progressivist rhetoric of architects and the connivance of their trade with\n\nregressive politics is, nonetheless, problematic. 368 In \"The Global Architect,\" Donald McNeill argues that\n\nthe star system in architecture, by reinforcing myths about architecture's autonomy of its social and\n\npolitical context, is instrumental to the urban entrepreneurial \"moment\" UAE cities exemplify. 369 The\n\ndecontextualized buildings and people of Abu Dhabi's urban visions exist as deletions of the country's\n\npolitical regime, and the social and physical scaffoldings that sustain it. In this sense the mobility of both\n\ns66 Larson, Behind the Postmodern Facade, 18.\n367 Kanna's analysis crucially borrows from Lefebvre the use of the term \"urbanist\" to refer to this larger social group\ninvolved in the production of space. \"Urbanism\" refers thus to \"an ideology and a set of discourses consisting of\nrepresentations deployed in specific projects of the imagination of the urban.\" Kanna, Dubai, the City as Corporation,\n83.\n368 McEwen traces the relationship of architecture and power to Vitruvius and Caesar. \"In what way did [the\nbuildings] record power? Essentially, according to Vitruvius, by increase. Auctoritas in buildings is a concomitant,\nvariously, of increased spending, of greater richness of materials, of grander spaces, of heightened contrast in the\nlight and shadow of a peristyle, of bigger columns and more of them. The magnficentia taken as the cause or\nconsequence or both of auctoritas has to do, literally, with magnification. Magnusfacio, 'I make big.\"' McEwen,\nVitruvius, 38. in Dejan Sudjic advances the provocative idea that works of architecture built as representations of the\nState's power may in fact be related to regime change. \"But Haussman's Paris was not simply the product of\nimperial megalomania. Without it, France would have been a poorer and less commanding state.\" Sudjic, The Edifice\nComplex, 375.\n369 \"Starchitecture, which privilieges the role of the architect as aesthete and genius of pure form and which elevates\na few notable architects, investing them with almost super human powers of theoretical and aesthetic insight, is well\nsuited to the demands of cities on the make.\" McNeill, The Global Architect, 82.\n\n113\n\n\nthe architect and the laborer enact, in Lucy Suchman's words, a form of \"conscription,\" but \"in one case\n\nit liberates from responsibility, while in the other it effectively enslaves.37 \"\n\nThe explication of architecture's complicated relationship to power resists simplification and exceeds\n\nthe scope of this study,37 as it may be a structural conundrum of the social role of the architect. With this\n\nproblematic landscape as a background, I zoom into the socio-technical practice of Building Information\n\nModeling (BIM) and discuss its aspiration of becoming a linguafranca for design and construction.\n\n370 From an email conversation with the author.\n371 Architects and architecture scholars have discussed alternative models of practice that renegotiate the client\ndependency that characterizes architecture.

BIM FROM THE FIELD: SEEKING A LINGUA FRANCA\n\nIntroduction\n\nOutline\n\nA lingua franca (or working language, bridge language, vehicular language) is a\nlanguage systematically used to make communication possible between people not\nsharing a mother tongue, in particular when it is a third language, distinct from\nboth mother tongues.3 72\n\nLatour argues that the actions taking place in a biology laboratory \"can be ordered by looking at how\n\nscientists transform rats and chemicals into paper.\" 373 In a similar voice, I would like to suggest that the\n\nactions taking place in the \"laboratory\" of BIM coordination can be ordered by looking at the way in\n\nwhich drawings are transformed into buildings. In this chapter, I provide a critical account of the situated\n\npractice of BIM coordination. This chapter seeks to see the socio-material worlds of BIM through an\n\nempirical lens,3 74 placing interpretive emphasis on the considerable technical -and discursive- efforts\n\ninvested in the rhetorical construction of BIM as an infrastructural technology for design to circulate.\n\nLooking at two projects in Abu Dhabi -a high-end mall and a gallery complex-375 I seek to interrogate\n\nBIM's aspiration to become universal: not only a center, but also a transparent linguafranca for design and\n\nconstruction.\n\n372 Viacheslav Chirikba, \"The Problem of the Caucasian Sprachbund,\" in From Linguistic Areas to Areal Linguistics,\nPieter Muyksen., Studies in Language Companion 90 (John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2008), 31,\nhttp://independent.academia.edu/ViacheslavChirikba/Papers/57 1530/TheProblemoftheCaucasianSprachb\nund.

(Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1987).\n375 The project and organization names and other details have been omitted or transformed to protect the\nanonymity of people and the confidentiality of organizations.\n\n120\n\n\nContractual dimension of the Albertian split\n\nI have described the architect's unbinding from the worlds of construction and labor -the Albertian\n\nsplit- as a defining trait of the architect's discipline. In the contemporary practice of building production,\n\nthe gap 376 exists as a culturally established and legally enforced boundary. This boundary plays a major\n\nrole in structuring the trades involved in the production of the built environment. In the Emirati context,\n\nthe typical form of project organization is a vertical structure involving the client -a government\n\ninvestment arm- and a developer -hired by the client- for managing the totality of the project. The\n\ndeveloper manages both the design and construction services through separate contracts. 377 Once the\n\narchitect has designed the building, the developer releases a set of drawings and models about the project\n\nfor \"tender,\" a competition process in which different companies compete for the contract by making\n\ndetailed plans for the building's execution. During the tender process bidding companies work for months\n\non the development of the plans without certainty of getting the project. For the financial risks involved,\n\nbids are often developed by alliances, or \"joint ventures,\" between two or more engineering consultancies\n\nand construction corporations. The joint ventures allow companies to distribute the risk, share resources\n\nand the skills of their personnel, and improve their chances of being awarded the contract. In Abu Dhabi,\n\ncontracts can often be measured in the billions of dollars. 378 During the tender process, the goal of the\n\nbidding organization is to produce detailed and convincing execution plans that demonstrate to the\n\ndeveloper (and to the client) their capacity to bring the project into completion faster and cheaper than\n\ntheir competitors: week by week schedules of the construction, material supply management strategies,\n\nlogistic path planning accounting for the use of machinery and personnel on site, labor transportation\n\nplan, simulations of critical aspects of the construction process, development of design alternatives to\n\nreduce the cost components of the architect's proposal. 379\n\n\"Frozen\" designs\n\nTo develop their proposals, bidding organizations are given access to a limited set of descriptions of the\n\nproject known as the \"tender package.\" The package usually contains a set of the architect's drawings\n\nknown as \"Issued for Construction,\"380 and (sometimes), a 3-D model. Both the drawings and the models\n\n376 See Chapter 1.\n31 This modality is known in industry as turn-key.\n378 The construction of the TWM is estimated in 1.3 billion dollars.\n37 This process is known as \"value engineering.\"\n3,( This set of drawings is usually referred to as \"the IFC.\" Not to be confused with the JFC (Industry Foundations\nClasses) digital format for BIM. See Chapter 3.\n\n121\n\n\nare delivered in digital formats that restrict their use to visualization and reference3 81. The 2-D drawings\n\n-static by nature- for instance, are commonly delivered in Adobe's .PDF format, or in \"view-only\"\n\nversions of CAD files. The 3-D model is encoded in a \"for-reference-only\" format, such as Autodesk's\n\n.NAV format.382 Because of its restrictions, BIM consultants commonly describe the model provided by\n\nthe architects as \"dead,\" or \"frozen.\" The 2-D drawings, and the \"dead\" models provided as part of the\n\ntender package, constitute legally binding documents and can only be modified through intricate channels\n\nof institutionalized verification and approval. The restriction to the editable files of a developed design is a\n\nlegal provision intended to protect the architect's intellectual property. 383 Moreover, during the tender\n\nprocess described above, the restriction is understood as a way to keep a level playing field for all bidders.\n\nUnder this view it would be problematic, for instance, to include in the tender package a 3-D model that\n\nrequires proprietary software that not all participants have access to.34 Through the contractual pipeline\n\nof construction, the building's designs are thus transferred, first, from the architect to the client/developer,\n\nand then to the competing construction teams, as static -\"frozen\"- representations of the architect's\n\ndesign.\n\nThese restrictions on information use force the bidding organization to re-construct the design using\n\ntheir own systems of description. In this context, the ability to quickly and precisely re-create the\n\narchitect's designs allows builders a key competitive advantage towards winning the contract. It is in this\n\ncontext that Gehy Technologies seeks to position itself as a provider of a technically precise model allowing\n\nthe bidding organization to produce more detailed execution plans, more accurate estimates of material\n\nand labor quantities, more credible logistic scenarios, and more relevant design alternatives. Increasingly,\n\nthe \"BIM certified 385\" practices of companies like Gehy Technologies fulfill a contractual requirement that\n\ngives legitimacy to the bidding organization before the client and developer. 386\n\n381 The formats used can be opened in freely available software systems, like Adobe Acrobat Reader, or AutoDesk's\nviewers.\n382 Navisworks is a 3-D software by Autodesk. Like Adobe Acrobat, Navisworks can be downloaded for free from the\nInternet, as a viewing-only tool. While it's not meant to edit geometric elements, it is possible, however, to selectively\nexport geometry from Navisworks into other editable formats.\n383 Design development models and drawings in the US are subjects of copyright: \"The Architectural Works\nCopyright Protection ... extended copyright protection to a class of works called \"architectural works.\" The design\nof a building is defined as embodied in any tangible medium of expression, including a building, architectural plans,\nor drawings. Moreover, the work includes the overall form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and\nelements in the design.\" See \"Intellectual Property Rights of Architects in Plans - Architects,\" USlegal, n.d.,\nhttp://architects.uslegal.com/intellectual-property-rights-of-architects-in-plans/.\n384 This is commonly drawn as an argument by the standards organizations discussed in Chapter 3 to push the\nuniversal adoption of .IFC as single 3-D BIM format.\n385 An issue of standards: The software Digital Project is a \"BIM certified\" system according to BIM Smart, the\norganization behind the IFC initiative.\n386 Developers are contractually obligated to have a BIM provider to support the construction coordination. See\nAppendix for a discussion about BIM standards.\n\n122\n\n\nThe gap between architects and builders is thus not only legally enforced by the contractual\n\narrangements regulating the industry, but also a device for structuring the relationships between different\n\nprofessional groups. The barriers to information sharing force the bidding organization to re-describe the\n\nproject, while the contractual requirements demand that a BIM certified organization supports the\n\nbuilding process. Gehry Technologies represents itself in this context as a translator of the design into the\n\nlanguage of the builders. Its market proposition is, in this context, to bridge the worlds of design and\n\nconstruction.\n\nLegal boundaries to digital flows\n\nSometimes the legal barriers to information sharing restrict the circulation of digital information within\n\nthe same organization. During the development of the Abu Dhabi Louvre, for instance, Gehry Technologies\n\nwas closely involved in the design development of the architect's proposal. According to Arda BaadaÂ§387\n\n-a Turkish engineer and a Project Manager with Gehy Technologies- a team from the office in Paris\n\nassisted the office ofJean Nouvel during the design process of the building's unconventional dome,\n\nproducing a highly detailed BIM. When the design phase was finalized, the developer released the \"tender\n\npackage\" and Gehry Technologies was hired as a BIM consultant by one of the bidding organizations, to\n\nsupport their bid. However, Gehry Technologies was unable to use the BIM model it had previously\n\ndeveloped. The team assisting the bidding organization thus had to build a new model from scratch from\n\nthe drawings (that had been originally extracted from the 3-D model it had created).\n\nThe lack of sharing and its immediate consequence, the required work of re-constructing the 3-D\n\nmodel, are common sources of frustration for some of the project's participants. BagdaÂ§ who participated\n\nin the Louvre bid in both the Paris and Abu Dhabi teams, described the restricted flow of information\n\nbetween the construction and design teams as circuitous and nonsensical. More than a technical problem,\n\nhe sees it as an artificial constraint in the workflow. He explains his frustration:\n\nWe helped build the design model, and... Because of the legal constraints you\n\ncannot use this design model if we work with the contractor! We cannot use the\n\nsame model again in construction because it's property of the architect, and\n\nyou're not allowed to use it. And then you end up building the model again based\n\nin the construction documents. And where do the design documents for the\n\nconstruction come from? They were extracted from the BIM model! So, do you\n\nsee the loop? You create a design model, you extract the drawings from it, but you\n\ncan't use the model. You need to use these models to re-build the construction\n\n3 Pseudonym.\n\n123\n\n\nmodel, in a more detailed fashion and report discrepancies. So to me it's a\nworkflow problem. It's not a technical problem.\n\nBagdaÂ§ sees the legal framework regulating the profession as an artificial barrier to the fluid circulation\n\nof digital design information. Like Witt and Eastman in Chapter 3, Bagdag sees the opportunity of BIM to\n\nstreamline design and construction by transforming the flow of information -and further reducing the\n\narchitect's autonomy from construction.\n\nThe contractors need to be hired early on, in the early stages of the project ...\nWhile the architects are doing the design they need to be consulting with the\ncontractors on what is buildable and what is not, because contractors have so\nmuch experience in... in building things, and they know what can be done and\nwhat cannot be done... In the end it's going to go this route anyway, because\nwhatever the architect is going to design, the contractor will look at the drawings\nand say oh we cannot do this... Let's send an RFI, the architect will look at the\nRF1388 and so... You can eliminate all of this redundancy by just bringing in the\ncontractor early on and consult him on \"what do you think?\" or \"what can be\ndone?\"... I mean. Again, it will never be that easy, the lines of responsibility will\nbecome a little bit vague... and... And that's why probably no one has come with\nthe best way of delivering a project that way, but... Um... I think without this\nstep BIM is not really utilizing its full potential.\n\nFrom a different managerial perspective, however, the re-description of the project is crucial to engage\n\nthe project and the people involved in its planning. Alexander Barton89 , also a BIM project manager, sees\n\nthe process of creating the 3-D model from the 2-D drawings as a candid transaction between street\n\nmerchants:\n\nYou [referring to me as the client] have this project, and you think it costs \"X.\"\nAnd then I come [referring to himself as the contractor] and I look at it. And I\ndraw it again. I make my calculations, talk to my experts. And then I go back and\ntell you: \"No. It costs 'Y\"'. Then you say \" um... let's see.\" And that's when we\nstart talking business!390\n\nIn Barton's persuasive account of the bid, re-description is an exercise in business assessment. Barton\n\na mechanical engineer with a background in finance- understands that by centralizing the description\n\n388 RFIs (Requests for Information), are documents that circulate between actors in a design-construction process.\nTypically, these documents are addressed to the designers or the client by a member of the coordination or\nconstruction team, with the intention of clarifying an issue on site. RFIs are official documents that are archived and\nused to moderate conflicts between parties. Large projects have specialized teams devoted to write, manage, respond\nand archive RFIs.\n389 I use a pseudonym to protect the anonymity of the subject.\nS9 Paraphrased from a personal conversation with Alexander Barton.\n\n124\n\n\napparatus of the project in a Digital Project model, a team of BIM consultants can become crucial players in\n\nthe larger bidding organization. The BIM model is expected to allow all relevant participants to inquire\n\nthe model's attributes in order to facilitate estimation, inspection and dissemination of information about\n\nthe project. From Barton's managerial perspective, the set of IFC drawings representing the architect's\n\ndesign, are the \"raw\" material to be transformed -first into a Building Information Model, and\n\nultimately into a building. The production of the descriptions that mediate this transformation, and allow\n\nactors to agree, is one of the key services he bills to clients [Figure 33].391\n\n2-D and 3-D\n\nDespite the ambition of centrality advanced by the advocates of BIM, drawings, and not 3-D models,\n\ncontinue to be the authoritative 92 documents in design and construction. This poses contradictions for\n\nthose practices that rely fully on 3-D information during the design phase. In an interview, BagdaÂ§\n\nillustrates this point with an example, recalling a clause in the contract between the builder and the client\n\nfor the Qatar National Museum (also designed by Jean Nouvel) that specified that if there was any\n\ndiscrepancy between the 3-D information and the 2-D drawings, drawings had priority over the model.\n\n[n the Qatar National Museum] the drawings were extracted from the design\nBIM model, and in the contract documents it says that whenever there's a\n\ndiscrepancy between the model and the drawings, the drawings are superseded.\n\nSo... So, by default anyone working on the project, legally they have to think this\n\nway. The drawings take more priority. And we tried to change this mentality a\n\nlittle bit on the project...\n\nThe (contractual, but also cultural) primacy of drawings over models posed a contradiction, as the 2-D\n\ninformation was not originally drawn anywhere, but had instead been instead extracted from the 3-D\n\nmodel. 393\n\nYou know how the QNM is built of intersecting discs at different angles,\ndifferent locations. So... in the drawings there was a disc schedule giving all the\n\ninformation about uhm... The coordinates of every disc, and the angle of the\n\nsymmetry plane of the disc, all of the parameters defining the geometry of every\n\n39W While drawings are a universal interface, 3-D models require skills and technologies that are not necessarily\navailable to all participants. This is particularly true of software systems such as Digital Project.\n392 See the discussion about the architect's \"Auctoritas\" in Chapter 2.\n393 In a public presentation, Andrew Witt referred to the process of extracting the 2-D information from a 3-D model\nas model-centrism. In his talk, he advocated the idea of a transition between a drawing-centric understanding of\ndesign-construction practice, and a model-centric one. As Bagdas anecdote shows, the legal culture does not comply\n(yet, Witt would say) with the model-centric view of practice. Witt, \"Concurrent Design.\"\n\n125\n\n\ndisc in the project. So... We were doing like a model audit report at the beginning\nof the project to see how much [the model] is compatible with the drawings.\nAnd... We found that some of the coordinates in the disc schedule, which is an\nIFC drawing, does not make any sense. If you try to build the disc with these\ncenter coordinates ... you will build it 5 blocks away from the museum! [laughs]\n\nFor engineers like BagdaÂ§, BIM technology has the potential to reduce redundancies and optimize an\n\nindustry that is \"lagging behind.\" For managers like Barton, in contrast, the barrier to information sharing\n\nthe gap- is simply part of the landscape of practice. He embraces with pragmatism the processes of\n\ntranslation, re-description, and re-drawing that the promotional discourses of BIM promise to eradicate.\n\nFrom this perspective, the BIM organization role in this particular context of practice is validated by the\n\ncontractual and cultural separation between the design and construction work. Recreating the design\n\nfrom the tender drawings can be a challenging feat, in particular if the building's shape is unconventional\n\nand requires sophisticated instruments for its description. For a bidding organization, the ability to create\n\nsuch model is crucial to demonstrate a full understanding of the project. In turn, for Gehy Technologies, the\n\nability to produce such model is one of the crucial tenets of its business proposition, and a crucial claim to\n\ntheir technical expertise as providers of the infrastructures of design.\n\nEnforcing (and translating across) the split: the RGC project\n\nEnlivening designs\n\nThe Al Rabiya Gallery Complex (RGC) is an expansion to the Abu Dhabi Gallery complex designed\n\nby Berenger & Fallon. When the project was released for tender, Gehry Technologies was hired by a joint\n\nventure to develop the Building Information Model for the project. The building's design comprised four\n\ncurved exhibition wings converging into a large central hall. The most distinctive aspect of the building's\n\ndesign is the unconventional shape of the exhibition wings' envelope 94 and the center space's roof. The\n\nexhibition wings are enveloped by undulating surfaces clad with stainless steel. The wavy shape of the\n\nexhibition wing is meant to resemble desert dunes, in reference to the surrounding desert.3 95 The center\n\n394 In architectural language, a building's \"envelope\" is the enclosing element. Commonly, an enclosing element that\ncan't be accurately described either by the words \"roof,\" or \"wall\" will be called an \"envelope.\"\n395 Several projects in the Gulf are explained with metaphors about references to local culture or landscape.\nArchitects commonly use metaphors like this to create a connection with their clients. The design of the Sheik Zayed\nNational Museum by Foster and Partners, for instance, is explained as a reference to the feathers of the falcon (falconry\nis considered a national sport in the UAE). The design of the Qatar National Museum, byJean Nouvel, is explained as a\nreference to the mother of pearl formations found in the Qatari desert. The Louvre Museum (also by Nouvel), is\nexplained as a reference to the space of the market, or souk -although this is a direct architectural reference.\n\n126\n\n\nspace's roof, also clad in steel panels, resembles a ray fish, and is sustained by a set of steel girders\n\nspanning the main terminal area.s96 The longest of the structural girders is 180 m long -a significant\n\nengineering challenge.\n\nIn Chapter 4, Digital Project was described as a parametric environment, akin to a mechanic's table where\n\nusers operate in a Newtonian world of forces and constraints. During the tender process for the Al Rabiya\n\nGallery Complex, a team of BIM consultants used Digital Project's Newtonian arsenal to construct an\n\n\"enlivened\" model of the terminal from the \"frozen\" models and drawings in the tender package397 . This\n\nsection illustrates the tectonics of such descriptions by describing the modeling process of the Al Rabiya\n\nGallery Complex (RGC) [Figure 34].\n\nPlans for the plan\n\nMany of the hundreds of drawings in the tender documents comprise the traditional forms of\n\narchitectural description. Set-out and building plans, sections, construction details, and elevations\n\ndescribing all aspects of the project in minute detail. Because of the unconventional shape of the\n\nexhibition wings' envelopes, and of the center space's roofs, other forms of description are provided to\n\nallow for the precise re-construction (and in-fact, construction) of the building. Abstract diagrams\n\ndescribing the geometric principles, and mathematical equations describing the curvature of the envelope.\n\nThrough both diagrams and equations, the architects describe the algorithmic process through which the\n\ncurved shape of the exhibition wings' envelope and center-space roof can be recreated. While the center\n\nspace roof was a unique element in the project, the exhibition wings' envelopes were, despite their\n\nirregular appearance, successions of repetitive elements, paced in accordance to the structural axes\n\ndescribed in the project's main grid. Each exhibition wing, excluding its end, was a succession of four or\n\nfive similar modules. The section of the envelope corresponding to any module describes one interval of\n\nthe envelope's sinusoidal wave. The precise shape of a module's envelope -the interval-was determined\n\nby a succession of arc elements. The starting and middle arcs of the succession are the \"valley\" and the\n\n\"cusp\" of the sinusoidal wave; the minimum and maximum states of a mathematical progression. The\n\narcs in-between these boundary states are interpolated by applying a parametric equation that calculates\n\nThrough the construction of a poetic narrative about the project, architects engage the clients' imaginations and\nsecure commissions.\ns96 The \"design model\" of the ARGc was developed in the Generative Components plugin for the software Microstation,\nbut the reference model in the tender package was a \"frozen\" model in the Navisworks format (.NAV).\n397 The ability to produce a precise digital model from which reliable information can be derived -a \"re-enlivened\"\nrepresentation- is key for building contractors to establish credibility before their potential clients. Moreover, as\nshown by Barton's rendition of the bid, the model is both a way for the builder organization to appropriate the\ndesign, and second, a form of building trust between the parties. Digital Project, the firm's signature software system,\nplays a key role in creating a \"live\" model from a \"dead\" one.\n\n127\n\n\nthe position of each of the control points in any given arc. The parameters of the equation are the\n\nminimum and maximum X and Z values for that given point, and a t value representing the place of the\n\narc in the module (t=0 is the starting arc, and t=30 is the final arc). The arc element itself is defined by the\n\ninterpolation of a curve between the control points. The succession of the 30 arc interpolations describes\n\nthe progression between the valley and the cusp states of the module. A symmetric interpolation results in\n\nthe 60 unique arcs of the exhibition wing module, producing the distinctive \"dune\" effect. But first, the\n\nabstract representations in the drawings, diagrams, and in the \"dead\" reference model, had to be encoded\n\ninto the software. I now turn to give a personal account of my role in the modeling process.\n\nBuilding the plan: first layer of automation\n\nAfter months of dealing with subcontractors in the BIM coordination of another project I was -to put\n\nit mildly- eager to work on the RGC model. I had to first familiarize myself with the architect's drawings\n\nand, in particular, with the mathematical descriptions of the building's unconventional shape. The project\n\nwas very well documented -thousands of drawings and a for-reference-only Navisworks 3-D model\n\n[Figure 30]. To study the materials I appropriated a small room in the bidding organization's offices for\n\nseveral days, putting drawings on the walls and tables, highlighting important information, and making\n\ncountless sketches on paper.\n\nI slowly started by laying out the project's setout grid from the geo-located points in the drawings. The\n\nsetout described with precision the location of the building in the world, and the grid of structural axes\n\norganizing the project, with an accuracy of millimeters. I focused on codifying the 2-D diagrams and\n\nmathematical equations in the tender documents, into a structured 3-D building information model of the\n\nexhibition wings' envelopes. I created a parametric description of the arcs. Instead of a singular\n\nrepresentation of a single arc, I used a power-copy -a category of object in Digital Project allowing the user\n\nto define geometric elements in accordance to inputs. I specified the position of each of the control points\n\nof each arc by encoding the parametric equation provided in the drawings into the power-copy. To produce\n\na certain instance of the taking as arguments, first, the position of the arc along the module, and second,\n\nthe minimum and maximum X and Z positions of each point as specified in the tender documents. As\n\nparameters of the object, I added a variable specifying the arch type, which changed the minimum and\n\nmaximum X and Z positions of each of the arch's control points; also, a parameter for representing the\n\nposition of the arch within the module (a set from 1 to 30, considering that the modules were symmetric).\n\nFinally, I encoded in the power-copy the polynomial equation for the sinusoidal variation of the exhibition\n\nwing's roof surface in relation to these parameters. The resulting parametric system could calculate the\n\nposition of each and every control point in the arch, taking into account the \"type\" variable defining the\n\n128\n\n\nminimum and maximum range of the X and Z coordinates of the point -as well as the position of the\n\narch in the module. The resulting parametric object -the power-copy- was 46 Kb on disk, and could be\n\nused to produce several thousands different arc configurations. 98 The inputs for each arc were 3 points\n\ndefining the plane of each one of the 60 module's interpolations (generated also parametrically from a\n\nsingle object). Using this method, I was able to \"calculate\" the arcs for several of the modules of the\n\nexhibition wings' envelope, and locate them in the project's grid. Each one of the arcs in a module is\n\nunique. Together, because of the logic of the parametric equation, the arcs describe a smooth interval of\n\nthe exhibition wing's sinusoidal undulation. With the arcs in place, a surface could be lofledP-'9 to create the\n\ndesign surface of the exhibition wings envelope.400\n\nThe idea was to devise a system that could be used to represent any exhibition wing module. By\n\nchanging a parameter in the power copy of the base, like its length or radius, the whole module would\n\nadapt, changing the disposition of the arches and therefore the surface. Suddenly, we didn't just have a\n\nexhibition wing module, but the logic of a system to create aty module.401 By this time, while the\n\nproduction of each arc's shape is parametrically determined -and therefore semi-automated- the arc\n\npower-copy had to be activated manually for each of the individual arcs -30 times in a symmetric module,\n\n60 in a non-symmetric one. Despite the automation of the arc-generation process, creating a description\n\nof a module was time consuming. A new layer of automation had to be added to the system, in order to\n\ngenerate the building envelop in its entirety.\n\nBarton, who was managing the project, used screen shots of this early model to create a document\n\nproposal that expanded the BIM team's scope of work in the bid to include detailed simulations of the\n\nbuilding's construction, the synthesis of the concrete model -developed by a subcontractor- and a\n\ndetailed building information model of the exhibition wings and the center space roof. Besides the \"design\n\nsurface\" 40 2 of the building's envelopes, the proposed model would include the underlying steel structure,\n\nglazing, and cladding of the building. Once the scope was approved and the contract expanded, Barton\n\norganized for BakdaÂ§ to participate in the model's development. After introducing BagdaÂ§ to the logic of\n\n398 BagdaÂ§ referred to this parametric construct as \"light in terms of data, but logic-heavy.\"\n399 \"Loft\" is a common command in 3-D modeling software, which produces a surface object from a series of lines.\n400 A common parametric modeling strategy is to use a surface as \"driver\" of other components. In this strategy, a\nsurface -often referred to as a \"design surface\"- is at the top of a hierarchical system of geometric elements\ndepend on the surface. Because of this relationship of dependency, these elements are said to be \"driven\" by the\nsurface. The idea of the surface as a driver of architecture is a crucial tenet of Gelhy Technologies's work. In 1997\nDennis Shelden, then director of computing at Gehry Partners, wrote a doctoral thesis that approached the subject.\nIn the thesis Shelden suggests that the ability to create precise and detailed building descriptions driven by surfaces of\nunconventional shapes (afforded by software systems like CATIA) allows architecture to escape the \"tyranny\" of\nEuclidian, orthogonal forms. Shelden, \"Digital surface representation and the constructibility of Gehry's\narchitecture,\" 25.\n401 Daniel Cardoso Llach, \"Fieldnotes\", n.d.\n402 \"Design surface\" is the term commonly used to refer to the outer surface of the project. While it doesn't exist as a\nconstruction element, it describes the overall shape of the project and serves as a reference for all elements.\n\n129\n\n\nthe project, we set out to formalize the mathematical \"recipes\" encoded in the parametric system I started\n\ninto a more robust system for generating the whole project. BagdaÂ§, a seasoned BIM expert and\n\nprogrammer, suggested a re-organization of the project's folder structure. Because a model's folder\n\nstructure and nomenclature determine the future forms of usability of the model, this task was the subject\n\nof several hours of serious consideration [See Figures 31 and 32].40\n\nA model factory: second layer of automation\n\nBagdaÂ§ wrote scripts for automating the instantiation of the power-copies generating the arcs -adding a\n\nsecond layer of automation to the system, and greatly reducing the time required for producing the\n\nmodules. I developed new sets of \"power-copies\" that took the arcs as inputs and produced the envelope's\n\ncladding and glazing. Later, BagdaÂ§ developed apower-copy for generating the underlying steel structure, 404\n\nand a series of rules for evaluating the panel's deviation from the design surface at \"instantiation time.\" 405\n\nThe ruleset included color-coding each panel according to its deviation index, producing a gradient image\n\nidentifying the areas of the module where deviations from the original surface were critical -thus\n\ninforming a decision about alternative ways of cladding the surface [Figure 35].\n\nWith the system in place, it takes the computer around 15 minutes to produce a module. Each element\n\ncreated is placed in 3-D space, and within the project's \"tree\" -defined in part by the folder structure-\n\nthe hierarchical representation of the model in Digital Project's interface. An \"instruction\" document for the\n\nmodel's operation recorded the steps a user had to follow in order to produce a particular module. An\n\naccompanying datasheet contained the parameters for each of the modules. The resulting model would\n\ngive the bidding organization the ability to make well-supported estimates about material quantities,\n\nconstructability studies, etc. More importantly, by \"constructing\" a precise and detailed representation\n\nfrom the drawings, equations and diagrams, the bidding organization could claim that the unconventional\n\ngeometry of the building's roof was entirely under their control [Figure 36].\n\nBecause of the linkages between numerical values and geometric elements in the model, the shape of\n\nthe envelope could be transformed with relatively little effort. The capacity of the model to change was\n\nhighlighted to the bidding organization as a mechanism to produce simpler design alternatives [Figure\n\n403 As discussed in Chapter 3, unlike most available software systems, a Digital Project \"project\" is a system of linked\nfiles managed by a \"project\" file that administers linkages to a potentially large number of other files. The hierarchy\nof the linkages and their structure makes planning a BIM's folder structure and nomenclature a very crucial phase.\nDecisions taken at this stage are fundamental to the whole Building Information Model. Striking a balance between\nlevel of detail and simplicity is crucial to make the model a readable and usable information structure. The key\nvariable to take into account is the desired complexity of the files.\n404 Such approach to surfaces, in which a surface is the \"driver\" of a project's elements, is one of the crucial forms of\nexpertise that Gehry Technologies is known for developing\n405 Meaning that the rule is applied during the automated instantiation of each panel.\n\n130\n\n\n37]. Rather than creating a new design from thin air, the parametric model would allow us to just tweak\n\nthe architect's original design4 06 while preserving (or so we believed) the integrity of the architect's \"design\n\nintent.\" The building's envelope, being the most expensive and challenging component of the project's\n\nconstruction, was the focus of the \"value engineering\" 407 efforts of the bidding organization, making it a\n\npotential space for an expansion of Gehry Technologies's scope of works. However, a team of architects hired\n\nby the bidding organization, seated directly across the Gehry Technologies team, was assigned by the bidding\n\norganization to \"value engineer the design.\"\n\nThe boundary of design\n\nThe team of architects assigned to value-engineer the project saw Barton's expansionary impulse as an\n\ninfringement of a cultural separation between design and construction. The BIM and the value-engineering\n\nteams barely exchanged a word, and yet were forced -by their proximity- to glimpse at each other's\n\nwork and overhear conversations about different strategies for altering the building's design. 408 At times,\n\ntension between the two teams seemed to mount. During cigarette breaks, BagdaÂ§, Barton and I discussed\n\nways in which our model could enable a simpler, more efficient structure than the \"dirty marks on paper\"\n\nby the value-engineering architects. Most of the time, however, the conflict over the role of the BIM team\n\nwithin the design discussions took place between Barton, who managed the project, and the leaders of the\n\nbidding organization. 409\n\nEven though Barton pitched to the organization leaders the model's level of detail and flexibility to\n\nmodulate the shape, the contractual scopes were preserved. Instead of participating in the re-design of the\n\nbuilding's envelope, the BIM team was asked to participate more fully in the definition of the month-by-\n\nmonth construction plan simulation. Meanwhile, the architect's sketches of the \"new roof design\" became\n\nthe objects around which discussions about design changes took place. The dirty marks on paper drove the\n\ndebate about the building's re-design.\n\n406 These claims were advanced in tacit contrast with the tools design alternatives presented in \"non-certified\" media\nsuch as sketches and collages.\n407 Modify a design, often by simplification, with the purpose of cutting construction costs.\n408 The time invested in producing a parametric system for \"translating\" the architect's design intent into a precise\nand flexible model made it diflicult for the GT consultants -myself included- to accept that a \"new\" logic was\nbeing discussed. This helped strengthen the claims to authority premised on the mathematical precision of the\nmodel, and on the \"certified\" Digital Project model.\n409 In contractual terms, Gehry Technologies is expected to act as \"enabler\" (not \"proponent\") of design ideas.\n\n131\n\n\nTrade-offs\n\nThe modeling of the RGC envelope exemplifies the realization of the idea of structured modeling that\n\nMIT engineers like Sutherland, Coons and Ross, foresaw in the early days of computing: a structured\n\nmodel where both data and geometry imbricate, allowing for a stricter management and transmission of\n\ndesign information. More than a drawing of a design, the model resembles a mechanical system enacting\n\nthe logic of a design.\n\nTo what extent are parametric models flexible? In the parametric model developed by the BIM team for\n\nthe RGC envelope, the geometric variation of the building's shape is limited by the logical assumptions\n\ntaken by model's makers, expressed in the hierarchical structure of the model itself. By modifying the\n\nmathematical equations controlling the power copies, the BIM teant can change the variation of the arcs and\n\ntherefore modulate a different shape for the building's envelope. At the same time, shape changes\n\ndemanding a different approach -not arcs but segments, for instance- are outside the system's\n\npossibilities. In Shelden's words, they are outside the model's \"design-space 4 1.\" The more structured the\n\nparametric model became, the more its mechanical logic precluded forms of variation not prescribed in\n\nit.41I The architects in the value engineering team produced, in contrast, \"dirty marks on paper:\"\n\ndrawings, collages and annotated plans, quickly setting forth alternatives to the original design by KPF.\n\nThe construction of the model, as well as its inability to harness the conversation about the building's\n\nre-design, are expressions of the key trade-off of structured models and computational representations of\n\nbuildings: the more mechanically precise and \"rich\" a computational description is, the less \"flexible\" it\n\nbecomes. The structured model successfully helped in producing construction simulations, quantity\n\nestimations, and in asserting the BIM teant's technical proficiencies within the organization, for the design\n\nat hand. Moreover, it helped create a shared understanding of the project in the organization. However,\n\nthe parametric flexibility afforded by the model proved to be a restrictive vehicle for design\n\n\"exploration.\"4 1 2\n\nQuestioning interoperability concerns\n\nAnthropologist Natasha Myers has observed, suggestively, how molecular physicists come to\n\nunderstand the complex molecular arrangements they study in the embodied process of making physical\n\n410 For Shelden's discussion of \"design-spaces\" see Chapter 4. I have discussed these trade-offs in the context of\npersonal digital fabrication in Daniel Cardoso and Lawrence Sass, \"Generative Fabrication,\" in Design Computing and\nCognition '08, 2008, 713-732, http://dx.doi.org/10. 1007/978-1-4020-8728-8_37.\n411 See Shelden's discussion about Digital Project in Chapter 4.\n412 GT's claims about the \"purity\" of design intent were premised on the mathematical sophistication of the model,\nthan in exploring alternatives outside the \"design space\" outlined by the mathematical logic embedded in the model.\n\n132\n\n\nand digital models. 413 The same can be said of architectural models, both at the personal and organization\n\nlevel. Through the \"tactile\" work of digital modeling, a team of specialists can intimately appropriate the\n\nshape of a building. Through the co-construction and discussion of images and models, and the associated\n\nback and forth with clients and developers, participants come to build trust and a shared understanding of\n\na project -Barton's rendition of the bid as a street transaction illustrates this perfectly.\n\nThe contrasting attitudes of Barton and Baadas illustrate two forms of thinking about the \"gap.\" In\n\nBarton's pragmatic stance, re-description and redrawing, conventionally cast by promoters of BIM as\n\nmanifestations of \"interoperability problems,\" are crucial to building trust between contractors,\n\nsubcontractors, and clients. Moreover, it allows participants to build a shared deep understanding of the\n\nproject. In contrast, in BagdaÂ§'s view 414 re-description is unnecessary, wasting the possibility of sharing\n\ndigital information.\n\nWhat needs to be made clear is that, by making the process of re-description the target of optimization,\n\nthis view targets also an ecological system of building production involving diverse professional groups,\n\nand traditions of trust building and work.415 During the bidding process, the client/developer and the\n\nbuilder use the distances between the new and old media as a crucial space of negotiation to create the\n\ntrust needed to define the terms of the project's execution. It remains to be seen how mechanisms of trust\n\nbuilding transform as the forces of production bring us closer and closer, as BIM advocates expect, to the\n\ndream of a common, standardized language for both design and construction.\n\nIn what follows I discuss how as the legal and cultural dimensions of the industry move towards the\n\nadoption of Building 1nfornation Mfodeling, the inertia of contractually and culturally established roles\n\ngenerates social friction, and ad-hoc infrastructures of resistance.\n\nThe BIM coordination enterprise: building the TWM\n\nEnacting centrality in an adverse context\n\nLike other large, iconic projects such as the Abu Dhabi Louvre, the Abu Dhabi Guggenheim, and the\n\nAbu Dhabi NYU campus, the Abu Dhabi Thomas Wynne Mall is a franchise of a western institution.

The client is one of the\n\nmajor investment bodies in the Emirate. The developer is in charge of a large part of the Emirate's big\n\nconstruction projects. American engineering and management giant is the design and construction\n\nmanager. The design of the project was commissioned to one of the world's largest architectural offices,\n\nand to a multi-national management consultancy company focusing on architectural and engineering\n\nservices. After an open competition between different companies for the construction contract the\n\ncontract was awarded to a \"joint venture\" of the Asian mega-corporation TEZUKA and the European\n\ngiant QUATRO. On site, the joint venture between the two companies was referred to as Q+S\n(QUATRO-TEZUKAJoint Venture). As the projects' main contractor, Q+S hired six other companies:\n\nthe traditional building trades -concrete, steel, MEP, etc.- and Gehy Technologies as a \"BIM provider\" to\n\nsupport the coordination of the building's design and construction. The relative size of Gehy Technologies's\n\nparticipation (four consultants and one Project Manager) in the project was very small -amounting to\n\n2% of the workforce involved [See Figure 38].416\n\nInstead of the vertical power structures that characterize the industry, advocates of BIM imagine the\n\norganization of design and construction as a central diagram where technology is placed at the center of a\n\nring of actors including the architect, the client, and all the construction trades [Figure 39].417 In this\n\ndiagram, the BIM provider is absent as a construction trade, but is represented symbolically at the center\n\nby the model. 4 8 This central diagram constitutes an imagined geography of practice where actors' roles\n\nand modes of communication are defined in relation to the technology, which demands from actors the\n\nadoption of particular protocols of information management and exchange. From this perspective, the\n\nBuilding Information Modeling project can be seen to carry an agenda of discipline and control over the\n\nparticipants of the design and construction process. In the stories that follow I discuss how, in the process\n\nof coordination, the desired primacy of the model is contested by contractual hierarchies and cultural\n\nconventions framing the design and construction coordination. I do so from the perspective of those\n\n\"synthesizing\" the model: those involved in the assemblage of structured, 3-D virtual representation, from\n\nthe contributions of members of all the construction trades.\n\n416 Gehry Technologies's engagement with the project comprises three distinct stages. The first was to support the Q+S's\nbid during the tender process. The second, and by far the most challenging, was to use BIM to support design and\nconstruction coordination throughout the project's execution. The third was the development of an \"as-built\"\nmodel, an evaluation of the completed works. According to an informal conversation with Project Manager for GT\nAlexander Barton.\n417.See Chapter 4, or Witt, \"Concurrent Design.\"\n4 18 In Chapter 3 I discussed how, in early discourses of computational design -particularly in Negroponte's\nproposition- the presence of the technology and the absence of the technologist serves the purpose of portraying\nthe technology as a neutral, passive agent.\n\n134\n\n\nArriving on site\n\nThe Q+S site is the temporary building where the development of the Thomas Wynne Mall\n\nAbu Dhabi takes place. It's located in Yas Island, 40Km north of Abu-Dhabi. Wide, brand\nnew and -by 2010- mostly empty highways give access to it. Leaving the highway that\n\nconnects Abu-Dhabi and Dubai to take the Yas Island (East) exit, the driver encounters a\nnetwork of wide empty highways appearing to serve nothing but an endless succession of\n\nconstruction sites. The scale of the infrastructure deployed on the landscape is, however,\nimpressive. The six-lane highway is sidelined by a double row of light posts which are neither\n\nvertical nor perfectly straight -they are tilted to one side and bent slightly to the other near\n\nthe middle- a gesture that, repeated ad-infinitum along the road, offers a distinctive image\n\nto the driver -as if a magnetic field had distorted a myriad wires. When it's dark, the lit\n\nwires on the highway dividing the Emirati desert from the Arabian Gulf waters, offer an\n\nimpressive view -of carefully landscaped, almost futuristic, isolation. Steel structures by the\n\nintersections between the highway and secondary roads mark the spot where a future bus\n\nsystem will pick up passengers. The structures consist of thick steel tubes bent one over the\nother into an arch-like shape (a latticed sheet of doubly-curved metal between the twisted\n\narches shades the space where people will one day wait for the bus).\n\n6-days a week, 300 consultants and visitors take these roads to the Q+S site. Before arriving,\nthey all must stop in a security office, leave a personal identification document, and claim a\n\"visitor\" pass in exchange. The security office is a one-storey barrack in the middle of a huge\nsand lot -nothing inside but a desk, with two employees and an air conditioning unit. The\n\npass, once retrieved, gives the visitor access to a gated section of the highway that leads to a\n\nshort open road ending in the Q+S site offices: a long row of about 500 m of two-storey\n\nbarracks spotted with air conditioning units. The cheap building is made of plywood, painted\npale yellow on the outside, and clad with fake gray wood on the inside. It is supported on a\n\nthin steel frame elevated 1 ft from the ground by concrete blocks. Inside, the AC units roar\n\nand engineers, architects, trades-people, administrative staff and laborers -all \"visitors\"-\n\nwork on the design and construction coordination of the Abu Dhabi Thomas Wynne Mall.\n\nNavigators, clash-detectors, and other micro-roles\n\nPeter Galison has written about \"a new mode of coordinating activities\" emerging around computer\n\nsimulations in the aftermath of the war \"where scientists from different disciplines (different practice and\n\nlanguage groups) could form a trading zone.\" 1 9 BIM functions under a similar premise, seeking to use\n\nsimulations to form trading zones for design and construction coordination. Traditionally, coordination\n\ninvolves face-to-face meetings with members of all trades, each with a set of 2-D drawings describing their\n\ndiscipline's specific contribution to the project. Using printed copies of the building's drawings, and\n\n49 Peter Louis Galison, Image and Logic: A Material Culture ofAlicrophysics, 1st ed. (University Of Chicago Press, 1997).\nIn his ethnography of simulations, Yanni Loukissas has used Galison's notion of \"trading zones\" to think about the\nnegotiation of professional boundaries between engineers and architects. Loukissas, Co-Designers.\n\n135\n\n\ncolored markers, participants seek to reveal potential conflicts arising from the integration of different\n\nsystems. Common conflicts involve, for instance, clashes between the steel structure and drainage pipes,\n\n\"I\" beams crossing circulation spaces below the proper height, ducts diving into a false ceiling and\n\ncreeping (uninvited) in elevator lobbies [Figure 40]. Relevant conflicts are revealed and discussed before\n\nthey make it into the site -where things are much more expensive to fix than on paper. In a successful\n\ncoordination meeting conflicts are found, discussed, accounted for, and a responsible party is determined\n\nto solve them. A conflict is only considered solved when the party deemed responsible amends the\n\ncorresponding drawings before they are sent to the construction teams.\n\nIn contrast with the 2-D drawings of traditional coordination, BIM coordination processes focus on the\n\ninteractive environments of modeling software. Instead of inspecting the building's design by overlaying\n\nsheets of tracing paper, participants gather around the projection of a digital model assembled from the\n\ndifferent models provided by each trade. While in a traditional coordination process office assistants\n\nprepare paper drawing sets for the decision-makers' inspection,420 in a BIM process a new kind of\n\nspecialist snthesizes a general 3-D model from the contributions of all trades, inspects it with the aid of\n\nautomated clash-detection software tools, and presents it interactively to relevant participants during BIM\n\ncoordination meetings. These specialists are the navigators to the new trading zones of BIM.\n\nAt the TWM project, new forms of specialized work converge in the figure of the BIM coordinator.\n\nThe coordinator is the figure through which the 3-D world of BIM interfaces with the social world of\n\nconsultants, contractors, subcontractors and clients. When doing synthesis, coordinators collect 3-D models\n\nfrom other organizations, introduce them in the project's central folder structure, translate them into the\n\nDigital Project format, and create partial models for inspection and assessment. The term \"synthesis\"\n\nhighlights the fact that a BIM is not the result a single organization, but of the collective effort of a\n\nnumber of contributing parties421. The production of this collective model requires considerable effort in\n\nterms of the collection of data, the translation between different information formats and standards, and\n\nthe inspection of the inconsistencies, clashes, modeling issues, that arise from the juxtaposition of 3-D\n\nmodels. In TWM, members of Gely Technologies and the Q+S described the \"combination\" of 3-D models\n\nas follows:\n\nThere were five main 3D models to be combined: the concrete model (in Revit,\nby [the concrete subcontractor]). The structural steel model (in Tekla by the [steel\nsubcontractor]), the architectural model containing partition walls, doors and\ninternal windows, false ceiling and floor finishing layers (in Revit, by [the\narchitecture subcontractor]), the MEP model (in Digital Project, by Gehry\nTechnologies under the responsibility of GRMS) and the fagade model (was to be\n\n420 According to a conversation with architect Christophe Hellio.\n421 Seen from this perspective, BIM helps make explicit the collective nature of design and construction.\n\n136\n\n\ndelivered by the fagade subcontractor, but later on it was decided that the\ncoordination with the fagade would be in 2D).4 22\n\nWhen doing clash-detection, a BIM coordinator uses Digital Project to inspect the model for potential\n\nconflicts between the different models. Part of this process is automated -the software provides an\n\nautomated clash-detection function that evaluates two sets of geometric elements for collisions. The\n\nprocess, as typically done at Gehy Technologies by BIM coordinators, involves loading in Digital Project a\n\npartial model synthesizing the latest contributions of all trades to the area of interest, and evaluating the\n\ncombined model for conflicts. This evaluation is sometimes aided by collision-detection algorithms\n\ncapable of yielding an extensive list of clashes between two sets of geometric elements. However, some\n\ncoordinators dislike this option, as it tends to yield too many clashes. For instance Lorraine, an architect\n\nand a senior BIM coordinator, never uses it \"unless I'm doing MEP and steel.\" 423 She believes the\n\nautomatic clash-detection command returns \"too much stuff,\"424 and many of the problems it reports can\n\nbe just \"modeling\" problems (for her, architectural training is crucial to discern the real from the fake\n\nconflicts detected by the software). By contrast, Omar Fahmi -an expert user of Digital Project and the\n\nman in charge of training new coordinators- emphasizes the importance of the automated command to\n\nthe new hires 425. While Fahmi builds his role as a BIM consultant as a technical virtuouso, Lorraine -a\n\nmore experienced architect- emphasizes the advantages that her architectural training and experience\n\nrepresent for coordination.\n\nDuring meetings, the BIM coordinator steers the camera to show the series of conflicts. A skilled\n\ncoordinator will steer the camera object of the 3-D environment (Digital Project) smoothly from issue to\n\nissue, using semi-automated navigation tools provided by the software. 426 A less experienced one will take\n\na longer time in reaching the precise spot where the problem is. As navigators, BIM coordinators move\n\nacross the virtual space of the model to show participants of the meeting the conflicts of interest. When\n\nnavigating the model, BIM coordinators walk a thin line between speed and clarity. Participants of a\n\nmeeting may get lost or be confused if the model moves too quickly across the space, or become distracted\n\nor impatient if it takes too much time to cut a section, illustrate an issue from a particular angle, or make a\n\nmeasurement between two elements. Depending on how skilled the coordinator is with the software, he or\n\nshe may be able to accomplish other tasks besides the navigation and accounting of the conflicts. These\n\n422 Chris Reinig and Patrik Pynaert, \"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi Case Study\", 2010.\n423 From a personal conversation.\n424 Ibid.\n423 It is easier, after all, to teach how to run a command than to teach when a duct's proximity to a column may\nrepresent a problem.\n42b Typically, in preparation for a coordination meeting, BIM coordinators spend hours marking the issues and\ncreating paths through the model to organize and pace the meeting.\n\n137\n\n\ncan include using software features to cut and move sections of the model to illustrate particular conflicts\n\nin more detail -generally by request of a participant in the meeting. Also, sketching 3-D objects to test a\n\ndesign hypothesis on the fly. 4 2 7\n\nA disastrous coordination meeting\n\nCoordination meetings are real-time cinematic experiences, paced by the conflicts that the coordinator\n\nfinds and reports, and by her style as a navigator. The BIM coordinators' control of the model, gives them a\n\nprivileged rights to structure, organize, and pace a meeting. Jacques E. Guillot428 is an experienced\n\nengineer in his late forties who works as a site-manager for the construction of the TWM. He's skeptical of\n\ntechnology, and refers to BIM meetings sarcastically, as \"BIM shows.\"\n\nIn one of his first encounters with BIM in a coordination meeting, Guillot pointed at the model\n\nprojected in the wall and said \"this 3-D model is nice, I'm impressed, but it's this what we are building.\"\n\nWith the utterance of the word this Guillot hit the table on a stack of plotted AutoCAD drawings issued for\n\nconstruction by the architect. Given the context -a builder's coordination meeting- the adjective\n\n\"nice,\" used by the project manager engineer, had a poisonously pejorative connotation: it underlined\n\nGuillot's skepticism about BIM's status as a reliable source of construction information. Moreover, it\n\nrevealed his understanding of BIM models as renderings, akin to those made by architects to represent the\n\nspatial qualities of a project -images without any claims to material or structural rigor. Guillot\n\ncontinued, to the chagrin of the participants, furthering his view of BIM coordination as a corrupting\n\nforce in the project:\n\nI'm used to sitting in a room with the decision makers, each one with their own\nset of drawings, and together discuss and figure out solutions for the issues. Instead\nI have you [referring to a confused audience of task-force managers and\n\"overseers\"] and a couple of IT guys [referring to the two BIM coordinators in\nthe scene].\n\nTalking to the BIM coordinators in a defying tone, Guillot added: \"Ifyou have more updated\n\ninformation than I do about the project maybeyou should be the project manager.\" Guillot's reactions\n\ndeserve special analysis, as illustrations of a typical form of resistance against BIM.\n\n427 In a coordination meeting, for instance, it became clear that the space provided by the IFC architectural drawings\nin an auditorium was insufficient for allocating a large mechanical ventilation unit. In collaboration with the MEP\nspecialist and a consultant, the BIM coordinator tried to, first, relocate the 3-D element in another part of the\nbuilding, and then, was asked by the consultant to create a 3-D element with different dimensions in order to be able\nto locate the unit in another available space.\n428 I use a pseudonym to protect the anonymity of the subject.\n\n138\n\n\nAn important element of Guillot's frustration with BIM is what he perceives as an increased physical,\n\ncognitive, and organizational distance between him and the project's information. He is used to the\n\npaper-based coordination process, where incumbents of all trades negotiate responsibility in both design\n\nand construction by marking solutions directly on paper (he is, in fact, known for the quality of his hand\n\ndrawings). BIM, in contrast, requires for its operation of specialists capable of \"driving\" the 3-D model,\n\ncut precise sections in a few seconds, and sketch 3-D objects to test design hypothesis on the fly. Faced\n\nwith the projection of a 3-D model in a software system he doesn't know how to control, and operated by\n\na new actor playing the role of \"navigator,\" Guillot's reaction is anxious and defensive. The control has\n\nbeen, quite literally, taken out ofhis hands.4 29\n\nDavid Mindell has observed how Lewis Mumford understands technology through the concepts of\n\nseparation, dissociation and divorce, enabled by different forms of technical practice.\" 430 Besides the the\n\ndistance introduced between him and the project's information by the model, Guillot is frustrated by an\n\nincreased organizational distance between the conflict's identification and its solution. In an interview\n\nmonths after the meeting, Guillot explains why the channels of verification and approval of BIM\n\nconstitute an unnerving bureaucratic overhead on the project [Figure 41].\n\n[n a BIM meeting] it always ends up in \"we will check\" or \"we will send you\nan email\" and then [the report is] sent to five different persons and they all have\n\nto say nay or yay, and there's always someone who comments, or who leaves the\n\nback door open...\n\nWithout the client's enforcement of BIM on all teams, Guillot recalls, the project's managers would've\n\ntrashed it at the beginning of the project. However, Guillot admits that his frustration tempered when he\n\nstarted seeing BIM as a reference to the team. In an interview at the final stages of the construction,\n\nGuillot admitted \"now that the BIM is behind us, BIM has become more popular.\" Guillot celebrated its\n\nrole as a medium to reference the actions on site a posteriori. As a non-prescriptive, superseded recording\n\n429 Vhile the meeting was disastrous, many others were not. I present Guillot's views as an example of the arguments\ndrawn by skeptics about BIM, and as a form of explaining aspects of the coordination process. After participating\nand conducting dozens of BIM meetings (as a BIM coordinator) I observed that the most successful BIM sessions are\nthose that don't leave all to the model, but those in which participants engage different media, and go back and forth\nbetween the projection and the documents on the table. Combining BIM inspections with drawings and models, and\nlaser-pointers with color markers, gives a sense of familiarity, and enhances the shared space in which coordination\ntakes place.\n430 The printing press is near the top of the list: \"Writing was the key technology in this evolution, and for Mumford\n(as for many others) the printing press served as the prime example, effecting 'the divorce between print and\nfirsthand experience' by allowing texts to travel great distances from their origins. David A. Mindell, Between Human\nand Machine: Feedback, Control, and Computing Before Cybernetics (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002), 3. Bruno\nLatour elaborates this theme in Latour, \"Visualisation and Cognition: Drawing Things Together.\"\n\n139\n\n\ninstrument. As a reference tool \"behind us.\" This \"behindness\" will be further analyzed below. I now turn\n\nto discuss BIM's aspiration to become a common language for design and construction.\n\nA \"Babel Tower\"\n\nThe metaphorical constitution of BIM as a linguafranca for design and construction acquires a special\n\nmeaning in the ethnically and nationally diverse context of the TWM project. In addition to the diversity\n\nof cultures of representation and work, Gehg Technologies's managerial role was made more difficult by\n\nlinguistic barriers across the workforce. Among white43 consultants and engineers, it was a cliche to\n\ndescribe the \"multi-cultural432\" crew of subcontractors and laborers involved in the project as a \"Babel\n\ntower.\" This is captured perfectly in the relationship between the BIM provider Gehy Technologies and the\n\nlocal Mechanical, Engineering and Plumbing (MEP) subcontractor company GRMS (Gulf Region\n\nMechanical Services). At the beginning of the project it was agreed that Gehy Technologies would be\n\nresponsible for training and managing GRMS personnel in the production of a BIM-grade 3-D model of\n\nthe MEP services. 433 In the following excerpt, Evan Del Bosco, 434 a Gehy Technologies BIM Manager,\n\ndiscusses the difficulties of getting the Hindi and Urdu speaking team of GRMS to abide by Gehiy\n\nTechnologies's protocols of information production and exchange.\n\nMost of them [GRMS employees] were fresh from India... I mean, they have\ndiplomas and stuff, but when it comes to English ... [in the project] all the\ncommunication and everything is done in English, it's not like we're doing it in\nHindi. I'd say the [GRMS] company is about 95% Indian, and I'll say they do\neverything else in their language... Even to the point [that] when we are having a\nconversation... a coordination meeting, I speak English, a colleague of mine from\nGehry Technologies would speak English, but I'd say there's about 10 people\nfrom GRMS who all speak Hindi, and their local you know [languages]. When it\ncomes to discuss something with you I speak English and they speak English to me\nbut... when it comes to a general discussion with the 10 people in the room and 2\npeople from Gehry Technologies singled out... they discuss everything that\nthey're talking about in their own local language! Which I'm supposed to\nunderstand, so I'm lost! I have to always stress the fact that \"dude, there's a guy\nhere who speaks English and doesn't speak Hindi\" and there's a lot of time wasted\nover there because you have to try and repeat the whole thing again, which...\n\n431 I use \"white\" to refer to subjects educated within the Euro-American system, regardless of ethnicity.\n432 If in the world of New York hair-dressing saloons \"European\" is mostly an \"euphemism\" for Polish or Eastern\nEuropean, in Abu Dhabi \"Multi-cultural\" is mostly an euphemism for South Asian.\n433 Because of the sheer complexity of the Mall's MEP services, the task of producing the construction drawings of\nthe Mechanical, Engineering and Plumbing services' drawings concentrated most of the difficulty in an otherwise\nfairly conventional -if large- project.\n434 I use a pseudonym to protect the anonymity of the subject.\n\n140\n\n\nBecause they're not very familiar with the English, you know sentences and\n\neverything; they even miss out a few of the important points when they try... to\n\ntranslate it into English.\n\nIn the following excerpt Del Bosco speaks of \"scripting\" the GRMS team's actions by means of\n\ngraphical and \"sign\" languages, creating ad-hoc languages for management on the spot.\n\nIn order for me to manage their team, the... I would say... the Hindi team...\nUsed to be able to like you know... It's just like sign languages: I had to really tune\n\nmy ears and my eyes very well and make sure I drafted out like... simple\n\ninstructions for these guys to work with, so there are times when I, I can... I could\n\nbe able to even close my eyes... and say, this is what he's done and this is what\n\nhe's going to bring to me because I have given them simple instructions, I've been\n\nable to like, like... script it! I would script it out the whole you know, scenes for\n\nthem to follow, in a movie, which they have to do, almost every day. And with\n\ntime they became very used to those processes...\n\nNot-so-perfect slaves\n\nThe GRMS offices are in a \"barrack\" complex neighboring Q+S's. The space where the GRMS\n\nmodeling team works is a small, noisy room, crammed with South Asian men in their early-to-mid\n\ntwenties. They work with laptops loaded with AutoCAD and (a few) Digital Project software. Day after day,\n\ntheir work is to model the mechanical guts of the TWM: an impossibly intricate network of ducts, pipes,\n\nshafts, risers, booms, ventilation units, water risers, sum pits and floor drains essential to the building's\n\nfunctioning. Between 12 and 15 modelers usually share the space, of around 150 square feet, working\n\nfrantically, talking loudly, elbow with elbow. Two air conditioning units roar, adding to the noise, but are\n\nfar from bringing the space's temperature down to a comfortable level, and thus the air feels thick. The\n\nblinds in the two small windows are usually semi-closed, adding twilight to the heavy atmosphere. Most of\n\nthe modelers are Indian, some Pakistani or Bangladeshi. A number of older employees -MEP managers\n\nfrom GRMS, mostly South Asian- circle around the narrow space left by the desks piled against the\n\nwalls, nervously, with calculators, cell phones, and paper drawings. It's common to see them (almost\n\nliterally) on a modeler's back, shouting instructions about where to place a duct, how to avoid a clash, or\n\nwhat the dimension of a sump pit should be.\n\nBecause the production of the construction drawings was always behind schedule, GRMS employees\n\nare under unreasonable pressure from their GRMS managers, who are, in turn, under unreasonable\n\npressure from the Q+S (authority cascades down directly from the client in the project's vertical\n\nhierarchy). The MEP modelers are thus forced to work longer hours than other subcontractors,\n\ncommonly until ten in the night during six -often seven- days a week. Unable to obtain driver licenses\n\n141\n\n\n-because of lack of contractual privileges- the modelers are picked up by a bus hired by their company\n\nto take them back to their lodgings at a nearby camp. This is not the collaborative complex Negroponte\n\nimagined as the future of human-machine creativity. There is no glamour here. Nor are the machines the\n\nperfect slaves Coons imagined, releasing people from labor. There is no leisure here. These men-machine\n\nassemblages offer a dystopian glimpse to the reality of contemporary design and construction: the digital\n\nproletariat of MEP modeling and coordination in the TWM.\n\nAdaptation and resistance\n\nDel Bosco occupies a small desk in the room. He has worked for 15 months with the GRMS team,\n\nstruggling to produce 3-D models for the Q+S's approval. Sometimes training, sometimes managing,\n\nsometimes doing modeling himself, Del Bosco's skin has become thick -and he often says with some\n\npride. His role is to make sure that coordinated construction drawings can be derived from the models he\n\nand his team produce. This involves a constant \"fight\" against the GRMS's well engrained culture of 2-D\n\ncoordination.\n\nIt's been very, very difficult, for the past year and three months ... [to be]\nworking with GRMS. It's been very, very difficult. Some of them are very\nprimitive, and very traditional, \"minor\" oriented...\" As of today, we still have\nproblems because they still think like, 40 years, or 10 years ago, you know? 2D\ncoordination! The major problem I've had as managing the team was... [that]\nthey have a huge team for the combined services drawing production. That is\nwhat goes to site as final drawings for installation. And... the manager [who]\ncarries on his duties on that team is a very old guy and he's not like, very at ease\nwith modern technology. So he even calls us that we are playing a \"BIM\nmonopoly.\" So, imagine working with such a person... You end up, at the end of\nthe day, with the same results. It's a very, very difficult thing. You almost have to\nfight, like, almost every day, to make them understand. It's the only way. Because\nthe drawings get to site, and the drawings are different from what we have in the\nBIM model. It's because they focus so much in doing the 2D drawing on their\nown, and not consulting the BIM team [or the] BIM departments. But the funny\nthing is [that] they have [assigned] coordinators, from their own team, to help us\ncoordinate the BIM model.\n\nA strict schedule of weekly submissions requires Del Bosco to submit a new coordinated portion of the\n\nmodel to the Q+S through the shared folders set up in the internal network. The submitted portion of the\n\nmodel is then downloaded, translated into the IFC format, and incorporated into the BIM model by the\n\n435 He means they behave like kids sometimes. An ethnography of immigrant men in these contexts is overdue. For a\nliterary account, see (Tr.), Goat Days.\n\n142\n\n\nteam of BIM coordinators working directly for the Q+S. Once incorporated, the model is inspected for\n\nclashes, and a report detailing the conflicts is produced. Then, a coordination meeting between members\n\nof the relevant trades takes place to find solutions to the conflicts. The synthesis and clash detection\n\nprocess by the BIM team at the Q+S demands that the model is \"frozen\" for a day or two before the\n\ncoordination meeting while the clash-report is produced. This plan, however, proved ineffective given the\n\nfrantic demands for more and better coordinated drawings by the installation teams on site. GRMS was\n\nforced to continue working on the submitted areas until the coordination meeting, and to resort to their\n\ngood-old \"artisanal\" coordination methods.\n\nThe solipsistic turn of the coordination process led BIM coordinators, to their frustration, to knowingly\n\ninspect and report on models that were outdated by the time their report was complete.\n\nThe para-coordination paradox\n\nAt GRMS, older managers didn't \"buy into\" the BIM process, and continued to rely on 2-D\n\ncoordination media and methods. However, the forms were kept, and the teams continued to send weekly\n\nmodels, and attending the meetings, to abide by the client's directive of using BIM. When I asked him\n\nabout the process of instructing GRMS managers about BIM, Del Bosco laughed softly, and explained\n\nthat\n\nWell, that hasn't been easier at all to do. From time to time we organize\nseminars for them, especially if they're top managers. They don't directly get\ninvolved in the coordination. They sit up there and tell their subordinates as to\nwhat to do. As to how the whole thing comes out, they really don't put so much\ntime into it. All what they want to hear is that it's done and that it's submitted.\n\nWithout strong internal leadership, the teams quickly resorted to their traditional coordination system\n\nwhen pressure started to mount. To comply with the frantic project schedule, GRAMS established a\n\ncoordination process parallel to, and different from, the BIM coordination. In the following excerpt Del\n\nBosco admits how BIM coordination was concurrent with other coordination processes.\n\nSince what happened ... [a major delay], having to deal with the 2D and the\n3D at the same time there was a little bit of a delay... on the part of coordination\nbecause they were new to the whole process, and their managers were like...\nshouting all the time, so they enforced to do the 2D drawings at the same time\nwhen the 3D coordination was happening...\n\n143\n\n\nThe failure of the plan to prescribe action is illustrated by the fact that the drawings produced for the\n\nMechanical, Engineering and Plumbing services (MEP) company (GRMS) for construction were\n\nproduced outside the BIM workflow. Moreover, by how BIM coordination was ultimately outpaced by\n\nthe parallel processes of \"artisanal\" coordination by the GRMS teams:\n\nEB: ... The 3D coordination was happening and the 2-D coordination was\n\ngoing ahead because they had to do submissions.\n\nDC: And they were kind of parallel no? They were not... Or were... Were they\n\nconnected? The 2-D and the 3-D?\n\nEB: We tried to strategize to have them on parallel, like... but along the lines\n\nthey had to move much faster than how the 3D coordination was happening,\nbecause [we] spent so much time in the 2-D, and the same guys who were\n\nsupposed to do the 3-D coordination were the guys doing the 2-D, so we are\n\ngetting very little information to put in the 3-D to get it out.\n\nDC: So do you think that part of the effort of the 3D coordination was... lost\n\nbecause of that kind of separation between the 2D coordination and the 3D\ncoordination?\n\nEB: Yeah well, I would say that. From the beginning it was a little lost because\nthe same guys who were supposed to help us with the BIM 3-D coordination,\nwere the same guys who were policing the 2-D drawings. So we were in a way\n\nforced to be able to catch up with the whole project timeline, were forced to take\n\nsome of these 2-D coordination things that they were doing, back into the BIM\nmodel, and fix those errors. Because at the end of the day the 2-D drawings go for\n\nsite construction, and the BIM model has to be there for checking before the\nconstruction goes on. So how to make sure that these two things are matching...\n\nThe MEP coordination of the TWM project happened, but not in the centrally controlled manner\n\nimagined by the flow charts in the documents, but largely through an assemblage of methods that merely\n\n(sometimes barely) included BIM. The GRMS coordination process shows how the 2-D coordination of\n\nGRMS effectively outpaced the process of BIM coordination. Del Bosco and his team of BIM modelers\n\nhad no choice but to incorporate the results of the 2-D coordination into the model. After all, BIM found\n\nits role in the project by becoming a form of \"freezing\" the coordinated models after thefact. By then, BIM\n\nhad stopped being the central locus of coordination, and had become an extra layer of coordination\n\nredundancy.\n\n144\n\n\nInteractive data visualization of BIM coordination\n\nThe method\n\nIn this section I develop new computational methods of observation and analysis to provide a novel\n\nperspective into the digital practice of Building Information Modeling. I report on an experiment on data\n\ncollection and visualization of BIM coordination. In preceding sections, I have explored BIM as a social\n\npractice. This section seeks to explore its dimension as a flux of information instead. For the experiment,\n\ntwo separate pieces of software were developed. The first was a Microsoft Visual Basic module providing a\n\ngraphic user interface, filters and functions for representing conflicts in a normalized, object oriented\n\nform, as instances of a class. This module was inserted in the Excel coordination logs of a team of four\n\nBIM coordinators -who knowingly agreed to the experiment. When using the log, coordinators logged\n\nconflicts through the custom user interface provided by the module, storing them in a custom Object -\n\nclass. The second piece of software is a Processing/JAVA application that reads the data yielded by the\n\ndata-collection module, and produces a visualization of the issues arranged by part of the building, and by\n\nresponsible organization, through time. The data visualization is an enlivened version of the centralized\n\ndiagrams discussed in previous chapters. The visualization is arranged as three concentric rings. The first\n\nring displays the organizations, the second displays the project's zones, and the third displays the\n\nindividual conflicts reported. Lines going from the center to each of the rings interactively display the\n\ndistribution of issues per organization and zone. Thin lines going from the \"zone\" ring into the perimeter\n\nring represent conflicts. Each line indexes detailed information about the conflict it represents. A column\n\nin the right shows an image of the BIM model, a description, and other detailed information. Using\n\ninterface controls, a user can interactively change the visualization to display the state of coordination at\n\nany date during the period observed. The result is an interactive data visualization displaying the\n\nincreased complexity of the coordination process in time, as the BIM coordinators identify and report on\n\nmore design and construction conflicts [Figures 42 and 43].\n\nBy tracing the flows of information between different organizations over four months of a project's\n\ndesign and construction, the visualization enlivens the model of centrality with which BIM is often\n\ndescribed. 43 By using the flows of digital information as a source of data, this chapter seeks to improve\n\nour understanding of the social and technological infrastructures that enable the contemporary\n\nproduction of the built environment.\n\n436 See discussion about the central representation of BIM in Chapter 4.\n\n145\n\n\nLimitations to the data visualization\n\nThe interactive data visualization of BIM coordination is at prototype stage. At its current state of\n\ndevelopment it has revealed limitations to both the data collection and visualization strategies. For\n\nexample, during data collection, the team did not record the \"closing date\" of the conflicts. As a result,\n\nonce a conflict is reported it remains open until the end. A more accurate representation of the process\n\nwould graphically distinguish between open and closed conflicts. Nonetheless, the current prototype is\n\neffective in displaying the distribution of found conflicts in time, while enriching our understanding of the\n\norganizational complexity of BIM coordination in a large project. To address this, future work needs to\n\nprovide a more complete graphic user interface and data structures in the data collection module, that\n\nconsiders each conflict's \"history\" as fields.\n\nBy working on these limitations, the application can deliver a richer picture of the coordination process.\n\nConclusions\n\nAd-hoc infrastructures of resistance\n\nIn the projects I observed, these aspirations are contested by the projects' cultural and legal contexts.\n\nThe empirical observations of the situated practice of Building Iformation Modeling distort the imagined\n\ncleanliness, universality and centrality of the model as an infrastructure, and its commonality and\n\ntransparency as a language. The parallel processes of coordination and work in the design and\n\nconstruction of the Abu Dhabi Thomas Wynne Mall show how competing cultures of representation and\n\nwork vibrantly contested the centrality of the model at each and every step. Members of these cultures made\n\neffective their resistance in different ways, sometimes by ignoring, sometimes by superficially abiding to,\n\nthe disciplining regime of the Building 1nformation Modeling coordination process -this was the case with the\n\nparallel process of coordination carried out by GRMS managers and modelers in the TWM project. In\n\nsome cases, the resistance entailed brutal attacks discrediting the project and its members altogether -like\n\nengineerJacques Guillot's.\n\nPlans as prescriptions of action: a generative failure?\n\nMoreover, to the frustration of those involved in the synthesis of the digital model, parallel processes of\n\ndesign production and coordination consistently outpaced the currency of BIM. Some of these parallel\n\nprocesses, like GRMS's MEP coordination of the TWM project, followed their own logic, and proved\n\n146\n\n\nmore responsive to the contingency of actions on site. As a result, rather than to prescribe the reality of the\n\nproject on site, the BIM team's work was, to a large extent, to keep up with the facts on the ground.\n\nMeasured strictly against its stated goals of prescriptiveness, cleanliness, centrality and discipline, the\n\noutcome of the BIM coordination of the TWM falls short. However, I want to suggest that the outpacing\n\nof the model by the facts on the ground is not entirely a bad thing. Seen by participants as part of a larger\n\necology of co-existing systems of representation and work, the BIM acquired new connotations for the\n\nproject participants. Once Guillot, the engineer, started to see the model as a collectively arranged point\n\nof reference, as a form of redundancy, and as a behind us instrument for recording actions on site, his initial\n\nfrustrations tempered. The model gained an unexpected form of legitimacy as an instrument for\n\nrecording, discussing, referencing (not prescribing), the actions on site.\n\nDescriptions of BIM based on the tropes of centrality and universality mistakenly presuppose that BIM\n\ncoordination will replace established traditions of design and construction. Instead, the reality I observed\n\nwas much richer: it was a reality of conflict and co-existence43 7.\n\nThe liturgics of BIM\n\nMany times during the coordination of the TWM Project, BIM meetings were celebrated in spite of\n\nevidence that project coordination was independent of them. The legitimacy of the model, however, had\n\nto be constantly re-asserted among the involved participants -and before the project authorities- to\n\npreserve contractual agreements. BIM coordinators would inspect and report conflicts in the models, and\n\nissue their reports; subcontractors would be summoned to the BIM room, and all participants would\n\ndiscuss, one by one, the issues reported by the coordinator before the screen. From this perspective, BIM\n\ncoordination meetings in the TWM project can be understood as liturgical celebrations of BIM's own\n\nunfulfilled (yet, expected and desired) centrality438 .\n\nPerhaps we need to re-shape our expectations about technology: expect less cleanliness and universality,\n\nand articulate technological discourses that allow us to embrace more openly the contingent nature of\n\nhuman practices.\n\n4s7 A body of literature has observed the way in which varied representation media co-exist in design work. See for\ninstance Suchman, L. (2000). Embodied Practices of Engineering Work. Mind, Culture, and Activity, 7 (1&2), 4-18.\nAlso: Suchman, L. (2000). Organizing Alignment. Organization , 311-327. And Henderson, On Line and on Paper.\n438 In Chapter 4 I discussed how the constitution of the design \"artifact\" by some advocates of BIM, there are certain\ntropes that, through taboos, have the effect of sacralizing design.\n\n147\n\n\nExample of a Navisworks screenshot.\n\n148\n\nFigure 30.\n\n\nFigure 31.

CONCLUSIONS\n\nBuilders of the vision\n\nIn this dissertation, I have identified and documented a \"technological imagination of design\" emerging\n\naround the reconfigured discourses of design and design representation by the culture of technology\n\nproduction in the Computer-Aided Design Project -a Cold War era research operation funded by the US Air\n\nForce at MIT- tracing it into its contemporary deployment in the technology project known as Building\n\nInformation Modeling.\n\nExploring the discursive and technological linkages between these two sites, I have outlined the ongoing\n\nconstitution of technological centrality and universality as dominant tropes in discourses about design\n\nproduction, charting an expanded critical perspective on design that looks at technological systems -such\n\nas software- and the cultures that produce them, with their histories and regimes of power, as crucial\n\nparticipants in -rather than as neutral vessels for- the design and production of our built environment.\n\nThe dissertation ranges from examining the politics of representation, participation and authorship in\n\nthe early CAD systems proposed by members of the Computer-Aided Design Project -in particular that\n\nin Steven Coons and Nicholas Negroponte's man-machine design systems- to discussing the culture of\n\nBIM coordination through an ethnographic portrait -and data-visualization- of its practice at Gehry\n\nTechnologies in two large projects in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThis study has shown how technological discourses and artifacts act as brokers for culturally dominant\n\nconceptions of design, representation, and work.\n\nI have named this study \"Builders of the vision\" because I found this phrase to say something crucial\n\nabout the various engineering and design cultures I thread in it. The Renaissance architects and artists\n\nwho developed the geometric methods for perspective representation, mathematized visual perception\n\nand endowed spatial representation with the allure of scientific validity -they built perceptual vision into\n\nthe two-dimensional space of paper and canvas. The MIT engineers, like Larry Roberts, who hacked into\n\nthe mathematics of perspective representation, encoding it in the language of computers, built the\n\nfoundations of a hybrid representational tradition expressed in the indexical combination of perspective\n\ngeometry and data -they built the Renaissance vision into the symbolic worlds of computational\n\n160\n\n\nabstraction and its electronic display. The engineers of the Computer-Aided Design Project, while computers\n\nwere still in their infancy, re-imagined conceptions of design, representation and material in the language, and\n\nimage, of the computer -they built visionary artifacts, discourses and philosophies of design, casting\n\ndesign as cybernetic systems of information flows (this dissertation showed how the contemporary\n\nproduction of the built environment continues to invoke their vision). The architects, engineers,\n\nconsultants and laborers working in Abu Dhabi, design and build iconic buildings for the family-state to\n\nrepresent the Emirate as a modern and progressive state -while deleting, in their own transiency, the\n\ntraces of profound political and ethno-national contradictions. The BIM consultants, working between the\n\ndusty construction sites of Abu Dhabi and the sleek virtual environments of Digital Project, painstakingly\n\nnegotiate with sub-contractors and clients the collective construction of gargantuan three-dimensional\n\nmodels enabling them to envision the smallest details of the buildings they produce -they build the\n\nurbanist's vision in the abstract world of the computer.\n\nBy listening to their voices, this dissertation has sought to enrich our understanding of how engineers,\n\narchitects and technology advocates have theories, philosophies and forms of understanding that guide -\n\nor characterize- their encounters with technology. I hope to have shown that not only their artifacts, but\n\nalso their voices, have built our contemporary vision and given shape to our world.\n\nMetaphors and geographies: roads, words, centers\n\nIn my study, I have identified the metaphors of infrastructure and language -linguafranca- and the\n\ngeographical trope of centrality and periphery, as vehicles to explore the worlds of representation,\n\nmanagement and simulation of Building Information iodeling.439 The infrastructure metaphor highlights the\n\nrole of information transfer in design and construction practice, construing design as a raw material -a\n\nsubstance- to be collected, transported, and processed throughout the project's development. In the\n\nimaginary of practice this metaphor invokes, software in general, and Digital Project in particular, is the\n\n\"pipeline\" bound to replace artisanal channels for information circulation. While Building Iformation\n\n43 The work on professional identities carried by the initiative for Technology and Self, led by Sherry Turkle at\nMIT, and -more specifically- the empirical study of simulation practices at ARUP, by Yanni Loukissas (see\nLoukissas, Co-Designers.), are important references for this study. My approach, however, differs in crucial conceptual\nand methodological aspects. For instance, I see limitations in their use of the concept of simulation to refer to\ncomputational representations, and the related metaphor, espoused in Loukissas's study, of simulations as a kind of\ntheatre. While this metaphor suits their analytical framework -an inquiry into the constitution of professional\nboundaries between architects and engineers- for my purposes in this study casting computational design models as\ntheatrical representations shuts down important domains of analysis. By construing computational descriptions as\nstaged, or figural, descriptions of reality, the simulation frame invokes them as \"mappings\" to be thought through their\nresemblance to an actual, or projected, object-reality. My approach seeks instead to assign relevance to what goes on\nin both \"sides\" of the interface, recognizing the technological agencies of software as research subjects and sites.\n\n161\n\n\nModeling is commonly represented as a neutral infrastructure enabling an effortless flow of design\n\ninformation -from abstraction into building- my analysis shows how the construction of this\n\ninfrastructure is an arduous organizational, rhetorical and technological endeavor. The second metaphor\n\nis that of BIM as a linguafranca -a common language for all participants of design and construction. In\n\nthe imaginary of practice this metaphor invokes, software in general, and Digital Project in particular,\n\nreduces the \"social frictions\" 440 arising from the multiplicity of languages of communication. In turn,\n\ndesign and construction practices outside the paradigm are construed as artisanal and unruly linguistic\n\nand cultural landscapes -the \"Babel\" figure is recurrent. This metaphor highlights a conception of\n\nnatural languages and 2-D drawings -including those produced in software systems not certified as valid\n\nBIM platforms- as imprecise and incomplete forms of documentation. Paraphrasing Ivan Sutherland's\n\npejorative description of pencil and paper drawings, those who seek the linguafranca of BIM construe non-\n\nBIM digital representations as \"dirty marks on the screen.\" Or, as a kind of dialect. From this it follows that\n\ncrucial to the realization of the Building Information Modeling project is the legal and cultural project of\n\nconstituting BIM certified models as the authoritative form of design documentation 44 1.\n\nBoth metaphors frame the technological proposition of BIM within industrial, nineteenth century\n\nimaginaries of cultural and technological progress. On one hand, the idea of large infrastructures for the\n\nspeedy transportation of information goods evokes images of canals, railroads, telephone lines and\n\nhighways. On the other, the assumed linguistic superiority of BIM as a language, its supposed capacity to\n\nconstitute a linguafranca, invokes colonial images of both culturalizing and deculturalizing anthropological\n\nendeavors. These metaphors speak of the imperial aspirations invoked by the technological project of\n\nBuilding Inforiation Modeling.\n\nDoes software have politics?\n\nThe power of things\n\nIn our accustomed way of thinking technologies are seen as neutral tools that\ncan be used well or poorly, for good, evil, or something in between. But we usually\ndo not stop to inquire whether a given device might have been designed and built\nin such a way that it produces a set of consequences logically and temporally prior\nto any of its professed uses.4 4 2\n\n440 Phillip Bernstein, \"Building Information Modeling,\" At Issue: The Aessage in the Medium, Winter 2011.\n441 See Appendix A for a discussion of the BIM standardization project.\n442 Winner, \"Do artifacts have politics?,\" 3.\n\n162\n\n\nTechnology is basically neutral. It's kind of like a hammer. The hammer doesn't\n\ncare whether you use it to build a house, or whether a torturer uses it to crush\n\nsomebody's skull.44 3\n\nIn \"Do Artifacts have Politics\" Langdon Winner discusses ways in which technological artifacts can be\n\nunderstood as deployments of power structures 4 4. As one example, he discusses Robert Moses's design for\n\noverpasses in the parks he laid out in New York4 4 5. Moses designed the overpasses to be extremely low\n\nmaking it impossible for buses to enter the parks. His bridges thus guaranteed that only \"automobile-\n\nowning whites of'upper' and 'comfortable middle classes4 4 6\" accessed the parks. The overpasses\n\npreventing buses (which carried mostly low-income black passengers) from entering the park can be seen,\n\ntherefore, as the enforcement of a politics of racial and socioeconomic prejudice. Long after Moses's\n\ndeath, Winner observes, the bridges he designed continue to prevent buses from entering the parks,\n\neffectively enacting a certain order of affairs of political significance. Like Moses's overpasses,\n\nunderstanding the technological systems with which our built environment is produced is a key form of\n\ndemocracy in an increasingly techno-scientific society.\n\nThroughout this dissertation I have argued that, like Moses's bridges, software is an infrastructure -\n\nnot a tool- for the design and production of our built environment. Can we then ask if there are any low\n\noverpasses in the infrastructure of Building Information Modeling? Even if software systems do not carry out,\n\nby themselves, an agenda of discipline and control, by establishing a space of alternatives and enforcing\n\nprotocols of information exchange, software systems shape the conditions where practice takes place, and\n\nare, in themselves, sites of practice. To understand this relationship, however, it's crucial to discuss these\n\nsystem's ties with cultural, organizational and social structures in which they originate and operate -\n\nrather than assuming them as neutral, or transparent channels. This is why, throughout this study, I have\n\nreferred to MIT's Computer-Aided Design Project and to the Building Information Modeling project as social,\n\ntechnical and cultural enterprises, with an intellectual and technological history worthy of discussion and\n\ndebate.\n\n43 \"Noam Chomsky on the Purpose of Education,\" Brain Pickings, n.d.,\nhttp://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/03/13/noam-chomsky-on-the-purpose-of-education/.\n4\" Winner, \"Do artifacts have politics?\".\n4 'Jones Beach,\" for instance.\n446 Winner, \"Do artifacts have politics?,\" 2 1.\n\n163\n\n\nAn expanded criticality\n\nIn \"Image of the Self\" Peter Galison asked about the Rorschach test \"What logic of the self did the test\n\nembody?\" and sought to \"specify that notion of the self that fits the Rorschach measurement technology.\"\n\nIn a similar voice, I have argued that in its interfaces, histories, data-structures, dozens of person-years of\n\nautomation work, and its deployment through corporate vehicles, software systems for drafting,\n\nrepresentation and analysis, embody ways of going about designing things. Paraphrasing Galison, I have\n\ntried to specify what notion of design fits these technologies?\n\nOne of the theses I submit is that there is a mutual construction of technology and design. It's not\n\nmerely the case that conceptions of design are changing. What needs to be understood is that we build our\n\nconceptions of design out of the technological discourses and apparatuses with which, and within which,\n\nwe design. An expanded criticality of the production of the built environment is thus needed to engage the\n\nsocial and technical specificity of the technological systems in which these practices are written.44 7 I hope\n\nthis dissertation contributes to fulfill that critical aspiration.\n\nAn ongoing inquiry\n\nAt the dawn of the information age Herbert Simon advanced a view of design as a \"science of the\n\nartificial\" that could be fully expressed by statements of declarative logic -and thus formalized as a\n\nscientific, measurable practice. While Simon's bold claim was a manifestation of larger techno-cultural\n\nchanges, it powerfully synthesized and pre-figured the contemporary epistemology of design and\n\narchitecture as techno-scientific, computational, \"performance-based\" and (for the most part) future-tense\n\npractices. Moreover, it helped design gain the kind of academic legitimacy that was elusive to trade\n\nschools, and its current placement in research universities as a field of rigorous inquiry and debate.\n\nHowever, it entailed a difficult paradox for researchers and educators. Conceived as a quantifiable and\n\nobjective, design could be imagined as a process of optimization, and as theoretically independent from\n\nculture, material and craft. The formalisms of information theory and scientific management on which\n\n\"Simon's shift\" relied permitted, through their abstraction, a divorce -in Lewis Mumford's sense of the\n\nword44 8- from the material and cultural situatedness that is the object of architectural practice.\n\nComputational design and digital fabrication technologies, because of their cultural and technical roots in\n\n447 Peter Galison, \"Image of the Self,\" in Things That Talk Object Lessonsfrom Art and Science (New York: Zone Books,\n2008), 277.\n44 For an interesting discussion about Mumford's concept of distance and dissociation, see Mindell, Between Human\nand Machine.\n\n164\n\n\ninformation theory and cybernetics -and because of the physical and cognitive distance they introduce\n\nbetween designers and artifacts- are doubly exposed to this paradox, and are too often explained as\n\npassive supports, or obedient makers, of design -as perfect slaves. However, software and hardware are\n\nnot merely supports, or slaves, of our design ideas. Instead, they shape them (they are them!), and shape us\n\nback as designers and users.\n\nThe technologies we use to think about design today speak of other crafts, other materials, other\n\ncultures, than those historically associated with the professional worlds of design and architecture. I have\n\ncalled this condition broadly a \"technological imagination of design,\" showing how it rests on specific\n\nsocial, historical and ideological supports. Instead of framing them under the rubric of novelty and\n\nprogress, this dissertation has sought to demystify them, understand their histories and motives, and open\n\nthem to critical scrutiny as techno-cultural artifacts. It has done so through archival historical research\n\ninto the culture of technology production surrounding MIT's Computer-Aided Design Project in the postwar\n\nyears, ethnographic studies of digital design and building practices -specially those at Gehgy Technologies-\n\nand the construction, supported on critical perspectives on technology, of an interpretive framework of\n\ninquiry into design and computation.\n\n165\n\n\n8. APPENDIX\n\nAppendix A: Standardization efforts in the AEC industry: a review\n\nOutline\n\nDo standards for scientific instruments, frozen peas, tax forms, and automobiles\nhave anything in common? Is that connection a fundamental one that says\nsomething about the way in which we organize our world, or is it merely a\nsemantic curiosity, perhaps a leftover from previous and now archaic\nmeanings? 449\n\nThe goal of Building Information Modeling is optimizing information flows in the Architecture, Engineering and\n\nConstruction (AEC) industry. Researchers contend that establishing digital format standards for design and\n\nconstruction \"would enable the seamless flow of design, cost, project, production and maintenance\n\ninformation, thereby reducing redundancy and increasing efficiency throughout the lifecycle of the\n\nbuilding 43 0.\" Therefore, the success of the technological infrastructure for this information flow is\n\ncontingent upon the establishment, adoption and enforcement of standardized protocols of information\n\nexchange. This section reviews the efforts of a diverse group of organizations and institutions to establish\n\nthese protocols. To do so I rely heavily on studies of standardization in the AEC industry like those by\n\nLaakso, Howard and Bjork4 51. My review of these studies seeks to unpack a social dimension of Building\n\nInformation Modeling advocacy, as an enterprise relying on persuasion, marketing, public perception within\n\ndifferent fields, tensions between academics, professionals and institutions, as well as on concerns over\n\ntechnical functionality.\n\n449 Busch, Standards, 2.\n450 Mikael Laakso, \"The IFC Standard: a Review of History, Development and Standardization,\" 135.\n451 See, for example: Bo-Christer Bj6rk and Mikael Laakso, \"CAD Standardisation in the Construction Industry -\nA Process View,\" Automation in Construction 19, no. 4 (July 2010): 398-406., Howard and Bj6rk, \"Building Information\nModelling - Experts' Views on Standardisation and Industry Deployment.\"\n\n166\n\n\nThe size of the pie\n\nA 200-page report by the US National Institute of Standards (NIST) premises the effort for the establishment\n\nof such protocols on a projection of the potential financial benefits to owners and operators. 452 The NIST\n\nestimates that the \"cost of inadequate interoperability (...) among computer-aided design, engineering,\n\nand software systems.\" 45s to be close to USD 15.8 billion. The NIST attributes the majority of this cost to\n\n\"to redundant data entry, redundant IT systems and IT staff, inefficient business processes, and delays\n\nindirectly resulting from those efficiencies.\" 454 According to the NIST report there are more than USD 10\n\nbillion in costs affecting owners and operators. The rest is divided between architects and engineers,\n\nfabricators, suppliers and contractors. 455\n\nDigital format standardization\n\nThe first attempts at creating an open standard for the digital representations of 2-D and 3-D geometry\n\noccurred during the late 1970s from a joint venture between Boeing, General Electric and Xerox, with\n\nthe US Department of Defense 456. The result of the effort was the IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange\n\nSpecification) format, which was released in 1980 by the ANSI (American National Standards Institute)\n\nbut was never widely adopted by the industry. Instead, Autodesk's DWG (Drawing) format became the de\n\nfacto standard format for digital drawings-mainly because of AutoCAD's very large market footprint. In\n\ncontrast with the IGES, which was an open format, the DWG was \"closed\"-its specifications were not\n\navailable to the public. However, by the 1990s other market vendors had reverse-engineered the format\n\nand made it available to other software systems outside the Autodesk family -this is the origin of the DXF\n\n(Digital Exchange File) format.\n\nCAD layer standardization\n\nA \"soft\" form of standardization consisted on the establishment of conventions for color-coding the\n\nlayers in CAD files457, which developed in a \"bottom-up\" fashion in some countries but was formalized by\n\n452 The NIST produced the report for the US Building and Fire Council.\n433 Gallaher et al., Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the US. Capital Facilities Industry.\n454 As observed by Mikael Laakso, \"The IFC Standard: a Review of History, Development and Standardization,\"\n136.\n\n455 Gallaher et al., Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the US. Capital Facilities Industy.\n4,5 Bj6rk and Laakso, \"CAD Standardisation in the Construction Industry - A Process View.\"\n457 Architects with knowledge of layer standards and data management were valuable for companies. In a sort of\nmanual of technology for industry Kristine Fallon recommends companies examining new hires for their knowledge\nof layer color-coding conventions. Fallon, The AEC Technology Survival Guide, 78.\n\n167\n\n\nthe ISO (International Organization for Standardization) in 1998458. A study by Howard and Bjork,\n\nhowever, suggests that the lack of resources and marketing to effectively promote this form of standards\n\nprevented it from being consistently and widely used among the population under study-Northern\n\nEuropean architecture and engineering firms in 2007459.\n\nIFC standardization\n\nKey to the standardization effort in the AEC industry is the idea that the information must be readable\n\nby different applications, constituting a common language, or linguafranca, for all design and construction\n\nparticipants460. Because of the scale of its potential impact across professions Laakso describes IFC\n\nstandardization as \"one of the most ambitious IT standardization efforts in any industry.\" 46 1\n\nThe crucial effort towards standardization in the design and construction industries is the IFC (Industry\n\nFoundation Classes) format, premised on the idea of constituting an \"open\" standard without ties to\n\nparticular companies or software vendors. The idea, promoted by an industry consortium and supported\n\nby members of academia, is to provide an open, platform-independent, \"stable\" data representation for\n\ndesign intent to be \"carried\" or \"retained\" throughout the design and construction process. The FCs are\n\nobject-oriented representations of architectural elements providing \"object\" classes for describing\n\narchitectural elements such as beams, walls, and doors. These \"objects\" are defined in a way that relevant\n\ninformation can be associated to particular instances of an object as attributes. For instance, a door\n\ninstance could have attributes specifying its model, fabricator, price, and other supply-chain information.\n\nWhile a number of committed academics advocate its use in the name of openness and independency\n\nfrom software vendors, the adoption of the format has been slow. It's likely that the IFC standard\n\ncontinues to be sustained by an academic interest on open standards, and by government regulations that\n\ndecree its implementation in industry, but it's probable that the larger market footprint of proprietary\n\nformats of commercial software systems such as Autodesk's Revit will become the de facto standard of work\n\nand information exchange within the AEC industry.462\n\n458 ISO-International Organization for Standardization, \"ISO 13567-2:1998,\" Text, International O7ganizationfor\nStandardization, March 1998,\nhttp://www.iso.org/iso/iso-catalogue/catalogue tc/cataloguedetail.htm?csnumber=26766.\n4Y9 Rob Howard and Bo-christer Bj6rk, \"Use of Standards for CAD Layers in Building,\" Automation in Construction 16,\nno. 3 (2007): 290-297.\n460 A good definition of the intent is Gallaher's report: \"Computer applications use IFCs to assemble a computer-\n\nreadable model that constitutes an object-oriented database. This database may be shared among project\nparticipants and continue to grow as a project goes through design and construction and enters operation.\" Gallaher\net al., Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the U.S. Capital Facilities Industy.\n461 Mikael Laakso, \"The IFC Standard: a Review of History, Development and Standardization.\"\n462 In the appendix I discuss the IFC standardization effort in more detail.\n\n168\n\n\nInstitutional advocacy: IAI and BIMSmart\n\nA precedent of the IFC effort can be traced to the 1985 ISO STEP (Standards for the Exchange of\n\nProduct Data) project, which laid the foundations for the 1996 IAI (International Alliance for\n\nInteroperability). The IAI gathered the efforts towards standardization started in 1994 by an Autodesk led\n\ngroup of 12 American companies using AutoCAD. The International Alliance for Interoperability (JAI,\n\nlater called BuildingSMART) is the body in charge of promoting and implementing IFC standardization\n\nin the US (and later taken up by companies in Europe) since the 1990s. This organization released the\n\nfirst version of the IFC format in 1997 with the goal of making a platform independent \"Open BIM\"\n\nstandard for international use. 4 63\n\nSlow adoption\n\nThe IFC format remains a contested standard. Howard and Bjork suggest that \"there needs to be a\n\nreality check on the IAI [members] who claim that IFCs are used across the world when they are mainly\n\nused by academics.\" 464 Advocates of BIM demand more effective marketing efforts to highlight the\n\nbenefits of the paradigm among governments and owners, and its adoption by top firms, in order to\n\nstimulate its wide adoption. Howard and Bjork argue for proper training in universities, and ask\n\ninstitutions to recognize \"the need for a new specialism in applying technology, standards and modelling,\n\nand being responsible for spatial coordination ... How should a BIM specialist and training be built into\n\nthe construction process?\" 465 For some researchers the IFC \"is at high risk to fall into the trap of 'design by\n\ncommittee' if goal orientation does not remain a high priority\". 466 Experts see the commitment of major\n\nstakeholders to the BIM enterprise as key to its success.\n\nIFCs are not yet used and most industry is unaware of them. Development has\nbeen top down. The people who produce drawings do not care about IFCs but if\n\n463 The IAI conceived the IFC as \"a common data schema that makes it possible to hold and exchange data between\ndifferent proprietary software applications. The data schema comprises information covering the many disciplines\nthat contribute to a building throughout its lifecycle: from conception, through design, construction and operation to\nrefurbishment or demolition.\" Howard and Bj6rk, \"Building Information Modelling - Experts' Views on\nStandardisation and Industry Deployment.\"\n414 The authors remark that \"... Standards are nominally supported; no one is against them but few apply them\ncomprehensively. National groups have often been successful in implementing modest standards such as those for\nCAD layers, but international implementations need to be tailored for local cultures and conditions. Official\nendorsement, preferably by ISO, can give wide recognition but is no substitute for promotion and software\nimplementation.\" Ibid., 18.\n465 Ibid., 14.\n466 (Purao et al 2008) cited in Mikael Laakso, \"The IFC Standard: a Review of History, Development and\nStandardization,\" 171.\n\n169\n\n\nthere are products to help them they would make use of them. Why should\n\nconstruction industry firms commit to something irrelevant to their practice?\n\nAs researchers have shown the adoption of BIM standards has been incomplete. While there are\n\nimportant advances in countries like Finland and Singapore, it's usually very difficult to have all the actors\n\nin a construction process abide by the same protocols of information exchange. 46 7 Different professionals\n\nhave different opinions as to what should be standardized, and believe that the de facto standards-those\n\nthat result of widespread adoption, such as AutoDesk's DWG-should be formalized by ISO.468 Most\n\ncommercial software applications are IFC compatible and are able to export and import IFC files. 469\n\nHowever, evidence collected during fieldwork showed the IFC to be a requisite format for sharing, but not\n\noperational. Typically IFC models would be referred to as \"dead\" geometry. 470\n\nGovernment support\n\nA report by Prince Charles Kwabi shows how in the US, the National Institute of Building Science\n\ncreated a charter and set in motion a National BIM Standard Project Committee in 2005 to deal with\n\nstandards and trends of the BIM framework in the country with the flexibility of incorporating\n\ndevelopments from ISO (NIBS, 2012). Similarly, in the UK, the Government Chief Construction Advisor\n\nsuggested a roadmap and strategy for progressive use of BIM in government projects plus the need to rise\n\nto the BIM challenge through training and support. As a result, the UK Cabinet Office disseminated in\n\nMay, 2011 the \"Government Construction Strategy\" that indicated the collaborative use of BIM on its\n\nbuilding programs by 2016 (BIS, 20 l1).471 Supporters of the IFC standard expect that government\n\nintervention will raise the awareness about the open standards. An example, perhaps, of the Negroponte\n\nparadox discussed in Chapter 3: the open and participatory aspects of technologies for design frequently\n\nseem to require, in the practical world, of top-down measures.\n\n467 Howard and Bj6rk, \"Building Information Modelling - Experts' Views on Standardisation and Industry\nDeployment\"; ibid., 12.\n468 Howard and Bj6rk, \"Building Information Modelling - Experts' Views on Standardisation and Industry\nDeployment.\"\n469 BuildingSMART maintains a database of IFC compliant software systems, which by November 2011 registered\n148 entries, 17 of which were software systems intended for architects.

The company incorporated as a California\n\ncorporation in April 9, 1982, driven by Walker's sharp business vision:\n\nI can think of no business (well, legal business) where we can start-up with so\nlittle capital or downside risk. If this business looks shaky to you, where do you\nexpect to find a better deal? I cannot imagine any scenario other than total\n\ncollapse of society in which the sales of microcomputer application software will\nnot grow by a factor of 10 in the next five years. The big vendors of small\nmachines have not only not entered the software business, they appear totally in\n\nawe of it and willing to grab any product and promote it to sell their machines. 4 74\n\nOriginally, its founders imagined Autodesk, the company, as the provider of an \"office automation\n\nsystem for small computers ... a computer model of an office environment. ... [providing] file cards, file\n\nboxes, a calendar, etc. ... connected to a very simple database and query system. The entire system is\n\nintended to be extremely user friendly and straightforward. \"475 However, the success of the first version of\n\nAutoCAD led the company to focus its efforts on CAD. AutoCAD originated from a program called Interact\n\nwritten by Mike Riddle -one of the company's founders. 476 According to Walker, a key strategic decision\n\nby the board was to develop AutoCAD as a system that could be extended by third party vendors, therefore\n\n472 Walker,J. (1994, 3 1). The Autodesk File. Retrieved 05 26, 2009, from Fourmilab:\nhttp://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/ p. 300.\n473 See Walker,J. (1994, 3 1). The Autodesk File. Retrieved 05 26, 2009, from Fourmilab:\nhttp://wwv.fourmilab.ch/autofile/\n474 Walker, The Autodesk File, 23.\n475 Ibid., 76.\n476 In an interview, Mike Riddle recalls how (before Autodesk existed) Riddle demoed Interact for John Walker. Walker\nstayed quiet for the 45 minutes the demo lasted. Once finished, Riddle recalls, Walker simply asked: \"Do you know\nwhat you have here?\" \"No\" Riddle replied. \"A fortune\" said Walker. \"OK, Show me how!\" was Riddle's response.\nInteract was then rewritten and called MicroCAD, the first version of AutoCAD -which became was Autodesk's \"hit\"\nproduct. Instead of a lump sum Riddle negotiated 10% of royalties for the product and all derived products (enough\nto make him a millionaire). See Mike Riddle, \"Mike Riddle on Interact, AutoCAD and the early CAD industry,\"\nmp3, date unknown, http://www.digibarn.com/stories/mike-riddle/MP3_96_mike-riddle1.mp3.\n\n171\n\n\nfostering a network of products that created stronger dependency between their product and its clients477.\n\nBy the mid nineties 8 5% of architecture offices owned AutoCAD licenses 478. During the early 80s Autodesk's\n\nbusiness strategy to outmaneuver competitors consisted in aggressively releasing new features. These\n\nfeatures were mostly digital versions of drafting routines. In a 1983 memoJohn Walker discusses new\n\nfeatures to be introduced.\n\nWith the features scheduled for the 1.40 release, plus the items which we hope\nto have in 1.5 (notably dashed lines, double walls, and some form of attribute\ncollection and dissemination), we will have accomplished most of the goals\ninherent in a 2D drafting system. 47 9\n\n3-D modeling was not part of the initial releases, and was only introduced following marketing-not\n\nproductivity-concerns. Walker interpreted AutoCAD's client base, and pushed 3-D capabilities even\n\nthough there was no explicit demand for it. However, it provided an attractive feature that would lure\n\ncustomers and give Autodesk a competitive advantage in the software market.480\n\nThe capacity to draw 3D objects was thus added to AutoCAD on top of its drafting capabilities mainly as a\n\nmarketing move, as a feature. In order to implement the new 3-D modeling capabilities without having to\n\nre-write large portions of the software's code and thus slowing its the development pace, Walker proposed\n\na \"low-rent 3-D\" notion, which required a minimum of intervention on AutoCAD's drafting oriented data-\n\nstructures 481.\n\n47 The developers of Rhinoceros, McNeel and Associates, follow the same business principle today. This strategy is\nexplained by Ferguson and Morris: \"As the infrastructure of Autodesk-compatible software products steadily\nincreases, so do [sic] the customer switching costs. And as the product becomes more pervasive and customers\nroutinely exchange Autodesk files, the lock-in can become very strong\" Charles H. Ferguson and Charles R. Morris,\nComputer Wars: How the [Vest Can Win in a Post-IBM World (Times Books, 1993). Cited in Fallon, The AEC Technology\nSurvival Guide, 167.\n478 Fallon, The AEC Technology Survival Guide.\n479 Valker, The Autodesk File, 96.\n480 Walker explains the business rationale of 3-D modeling: \"First, there is a natural tendency to evaluate a package\nfrom the features it has, and a package limited to 2D cannot look as good on a cursory examination as a 3D package.\nSecond, many companies will reason, 'look, all we need is 2D today, but who knows about tomorrow; we better buy\na package that has 3D just in case rather than get stuck with a dinosaur.' ... The impact of rotating an object in 3\nspace at Comdex is many times that of zooming in on a flat drawing.\" Ibid., 97.\n481 The strategy to implement 3-D in AutoCAD consisted of adding a 3-D plane location to each layer in the drawing,\nwhere the objects drawn on that layer would reside. The viewing plane would be specified following the same logic,\nadding parameters for the kind of strategy used to project the vectors unto the screen (isometric, perspective, clip\ndepth, etc.) and was the origin of the idea of the viewport. Specifying the third dimension in such modular way\nhelped the developers of AutoCAD to implement 3-D in a way that was not disruptive of the more established\nportions of the code and data structures. This particular implementation of 3-D was based on shifting drafting planes\nin space. An added feature was the extrude option, which allowed users to specify a depth to each layer. Every time\nthe elements in the layer were regenerated, a new set of points, or vectors, would be generated by the system for each\npoint, connecting the original vector to another one in a parallel plane located at the specified depth distance from\nthe original drawing plane. At the moment Walker saw these features as minor additions to AutoCAD relative to\n\"major\" ones such as cross-hatching, line types, fillets, etc. He also saw their great potential as revenue generators:\n\n172\n\n\n\"Electric Malcolm\"\n\nIn 1983 a young intern was appointed for a summer job at the Autodesk headquarters in\n\nSausalito, California. Malcolm McCullough, a UCLA architecture student with a knack for\n\nmanual drafting, spent the better part of that summer testing and generating sample\n\ndrawings for AutoCAD release v. 1.4 . After that summer some of his drawings were frequently\n\nfeatured in Autodesk brochures. 482 By that time Autodesk was already a medium-sized\n\norganization with around a hundred employees working inside the headquarters, developers\n\nworking offsite from different parts of the world and third-party developers extending the\n\nfunctionalities of the core system. 483 At its inception, however, AutoCAD was not conceived or\n\ndeveloped under heavy supervision or influence of architects and designers. Autodesk co-\n\nfounder and CEO John Walker admits that McCullough was one of the first \"real\"\n\ndraftspersons giving feedback and recommendations to the developing team.\n\n\"Malcolm was the first person really talented in drawing to work for Autodesk, and his work\n\nwith AutoCAD helped both by generating good sample drawings and by identifying the most\n\nimportant features needed in real professional drafting. 484\"\n\nEngineers at Autodesk were so impressed by McCullough's \"creative\" drafting that they\n\ndeveloped a tool to record his drafting process with the purpose of replaying it later\n\ninternally, and in showrooms. They dubbed it \"Electric Malcolm\". The tool was never\n\nimplemented in the commercial versions ofAutoCAD due to \"stability problems.\"\n\nMembers of a professional culture distant from architectural, spatial and visual concerns defined the\n\ndata-structures used to store geometric data. As shown by the \"Electric Malcolm\" anecdote (see Frame),\n\nthe AutoCAD developing team didn't have much idea about drafting -or architecture- but it doubtlessly\n\ntransformed its practice. 485\n\n'Just think of the difference in our COMDEX literature of 'Now with 3D' vs. 'Now with crosshatching and dashed\nlines.\"' Ibid., 183.\n482 Walker,J.

The partnership involved a team of 14 French engineers from Dassault sent to the US\n\nto work on a first version and establish the alliance.

A common\n\nmisconception is that Gehry's buildings originate inside Digital Project's environment. Instead, Gehry's\n\nstructures are modeled on paper and cardboard models before they are modeled in Digital Project. Only\n\nwhen the design is convened the physical model is 3-D scanned and shared with Gehry Technologies.\n\n491 Up until 2011 these services were centered on developing new versions of Digital Project, training organizations in\nits use, and providing parametric and Building Information Modeling services to firms. In 2011 GT stopped\ndeveloping new versions of Digital Project to focus on the development of web based services. Dassault assumed the\nservice for existing DP clients.

Instrumental to this reconfiguration was\n\nShannon and Weaver's model of communication that provided an idiom for describing communication in\n\nterms of sources, signals and messages. 494 This idiom, intended primarily for improving telephonic\n\ncommunications, became a source of inspiration and a suitable a metaphor for thinking about design and\n\n492 Wiener, N. (196 1). Cybernetics: or Control and Communication in the Animal and the fachine. Cambridge: MIT Press. P.\n162.\n\n493 Bowker accounts for the appropriation of the cybernetic idiom by other fields of scientific practice with the notion\nof \"triangulation\" in virtue of which a scientist from a field uses the rhetoric of another to gain legitimacy. Bowker\ntheorizes that the generality of cybernetics (what could be more general than a \"science of messages\"?) offers a fertile\nground for these metaphorical triangulations: \"An isolated scientific worker making an outlandish claim could gain\nrhetorical legitimacy by pointing to support from another field - which in turn referenced the first worker's field to\nsupport its claims. The language of cybernetics provided a site where this exchange could occur.\" See Bowker, G.\n(1993). How to be Universal: Some Cybernetic Strategies. Social Studies of Science, 23 (1), 107-127. p. 116. For critical\ndiscussions of cybernetics and society see Hayles, Pfaffenberger, Galison\n494 See Shannon, C., & Weaver, W. (1962). The mathematical theoy ofcommunication. Urbana: University of Illinois\nPress.\n\n176\n\n\ncreativity. 495 Let's take as an example of this rhetoric strategy a 1963 quote from the first page of\n\nAmerican architect Peter Eisenman's doctoral thesis:\n\n\"The essence of any creative act is the communication of an original idea from\n\nits author, through a means of expression, to a receiver. The means of expression\nmust be such as to transmit the original intention as clearly and fully as possible to\nthe receiving mind 496.\"\n\nThese words commit to a view of creative design as the transmission of information, and conceive the\n\ndesign process as the transmission of this information. The logical implication of this rhetorical\n\ncontraption is that of design media as clean, neutral, channels, and of their use as a process of translation,\n\nor externalization.\n\nAlise Upitis writes that cybernetics and Information Theory reconfigured post-war society's conceptions\n\nof nature and design, and focuses on how architectural pedagogy, under the influence of the collective of\n\narchitects and designers know as the Design Methods movement, embraced a conception of creativity as the\n\nability of a person to provide a number of diverse -yet \"acceptable\"- solutions to a given design problem.\n\nThe degree of novelty of which the person is capable, or which he habitually\nexhibits, is pertinent to our study. This can be tested in terms of the frequency of\nuncommon, yet acceptable, responses to items. 497\n\nThe notion of creativity, Upitis observes, is thus related to the capacity of deviating from the\n\nconvention, a motif that is present in many discourses of design. The creative person is conceptualized as\n\nan input/output device (a black box), whose outputs can be measured scientifically. The Design Methods\n\nmovement conceptualization of creativity objectifies it: if creativity is a measurable variable susceptible of\n\nassessment it can be successfully incorporated in the market economy.\n\nIn 1933, Harvard Professor George Birkhoff boldly declared a mathematical theory of aesthetics by\n\ndeclaring the \"aesthetic measure\" as A = O/C (Aesthetic measure equals order divided by complexity) and\n\n493 An example of the use of this rhetoric is this 1963 quote from Peter Eisenman: \"The essence of any creative act is\nthe communication of an original idea from its author, through a means of expression, to a receiver. The means of\nexpression must be such as to transmit the original intention as clearly and fully as possible to the receiving mind.\"\nEisenman, P. (2006). The Formal Basis ofAlodern Architecture.

Architectural Pedagogy and Psychological Testing in Great Britain, 1958-1968.\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Architecture. Cambridge: Unpublished. A Marxist reading of Guilford's\nconceptualization of creativity may point out how it is suggestive of a superstructure (insinuating, perhaps, the\npresence of a manager?). Design as a production activity separate from judgment entails a certain sense of\ndisempowerment. In this sense the conception of creativity enforced in these accounts is revealing of an ideology of\nproduction and corporate capitalism. It is also suggestive of the -\nrelatively late- arrival of scientific management ideas into design discourse.\n\n177\n\n\nby testing it on a number of designs. 498 Stiny and Gips cite Birkhoff's work on aesthetic measure as a\n\nsource of inspiration for their \"Algorithmic Aesthetics\", where the authors contended that \"Just the\n\nattempt to represent aesthetic ideas or specific approaches to understanding and evaluating works of art in\n\nterms of algorithms is salutary.\" 499 The conceptual framework of information theory resonates in Stiny\n\nand March's later formulation of \"design machines\" -theoretical devices for producing designs phrased in\n\nthe idiom of Shannon and Weaver. 500\n\nEarly enthusiasts of computer art make a different reading of the cybernetic idiom. Early computer\n\nartist Frieder Nake writes that the adoption of information theory in the early moments of computer art\n\nmeant that \"A painting could be clearly considered the carrier of signs (...) On each level of such a\n\nhierarchy the statistical information content -according to Shannon's axiomatic definition- could be\n\ndetermined.\"5 01 Under the intellectual influence of Max Bense's Projekte GenerativerAsthetik ('Project of\n\nGenerative Aesthetics'), that -just like the Design Methods movement- defined creativity as the capacity of\n\nan agent to produce \"deviations from the norm.\"5 02\n\nCybernetic serendipity\n\nThe 1968 London exhibition \"Cybernetic Serendipity\" gathered a collection of projects focused on\n\nexploring the application of communication and control sciences to the artistic practices. The projects\n\nincluded drawing machines and software, computer-generated music, poetry, language and kinetic\n\nsculptures. The exhibition included works by Stockhausen,Jean Tinguely, Frieder Nake and Georg Nees.\n\nThe only architectural installment in the exhibition wasJohn Week's conveniently titled \"Indeterminate\n\ndimensions in architecture\", a relatively shy enunciation of the potential of computers to calculate\n\nstructural stresses under varying conditions or randomize fagade designs. Week's proposal nevertheless\n\ncaptured the spirit of the cybernetic promise of architectural homeostasis: 503 \"The impact of the standard\n\nanalysis on the varying conditions has resulted in buildings which are everywhere different, since the\n\n498 Birkhoff, G.

Cyberneticians' use of the term is based on their equivalent conception of organism and machine.\nWeek's move can be seen as a cybernetic derivation of Le Corbusier's famous contention that the house is a Machine\na vivre.\n\n178\n\n\ndesign parameters differ.\" 504 These machines' -if I may- sensibility recall British cybernetician's Ros\n\nAshby's Honeostat, a machine whose sole purpose was maintaining its state in an unstable and contingent\n\nenvironment via negative feedback. Andrew Pickering suggests that the Homeostat proves that\n\n(...) Cybernetics grabs on to the world differently from the classical sciences.\n\nWhile the latter seek to pin the world down in timeless representations,\ncybernetics directly thematizes the unpredictable liveliness of the world, and\n\nprocesses of open-ended becoming.5 05\n\nThis process of becoming embodies the cybernetic aspiration of performance, understood as a dynamic\n\nequilibrium between the organism and its environment. 501) However, in his doctoral dissertation,\n\nChristopher Alexander used the Homeostat as a metaphor for the design processes itself.507 Alexander\n\ncontended that design could be understood as an opposition between form and environment and design\n\nprocesses as an opposition between the -mental- image of a design context and the -represented- image of\n\na projected form. 508\n\nThe performative aspiration of cybernetics, embodied in the honieostatic behavior of a machine in non-\n\nlinear dialogue with its environment, unfolds in different discursive and material clothes in contemporary\n\ndesign practice. Net art, abstract photography, and the loosely tied collection of art and design practices\n\nunder the label of \"generative\" offspring in one way or another from the artistic practices above-\n\nmentioned, technical explorations phrased in the language of information theory and influenced by what\n\nEco called \"our culture's fascination with indeterminacy\". The constrained indeterminacy that machine\n\nagency conveniently affords seems to suit our taste very well. 509\n\n504 Reichart,J. (1968). Cybernetic Serendipity.

Cambridge: Harvard University Press.\n508 Eco's formulation of the cultural significance of the open work for \"contemporary poetics\" is heavily influenced\nby information theory. In Eco's notion of the \"open work\" the \"information value\" or \"meaning\" of a piece is\nmultiplied by virtue of its non-determined form: Eco describes this operation cybernetically as the \"growth and\nmultiplication of the possible meanings of a given message\", or as an \"increase in information\". Eco, U. (1989). The\n\nOpen Work. (A. Cancogni, Trans.) Cambridge: Harvard University Press. p.4 3 . Deviation from the norm is a means\nto increase the work's \"information levels\" and therefore to achieve a greater aesthetic value. Eco uses Information\nTheory for formulating a theory of the probabilistic nature of the aesthetic experience. A new conceptualization of\nthe composer ensued: \"The distance between a plurality of formal worlds and undifferentiated chaos, totally devoid\nof all possibility of aesthetic pleasure, is minimal: only a dialectics of oscillation can save the composer of an open\nwork.\" Ibid. p.6 5.\n509 What vision of the world does it imply? Eco proposed these \"open\" works of art as epistemological metaphors,\nformulations of a view of the world marked by the advancement of techno-scientific knowledge. \"The repercussion,\nwithin formative activity, of certain ideas acquired from contemporary scientific methodologies-the confirmation, in\nart, of the categories of indeterminacy and statistical distribution that guide the interpretation of natural facts.\" Eco,\nU. (1989). The Open Work. (A. Cancogni, Trans.) Cambridge: Harvard University Press. p. 87\n\n179\n\n\nEmbodiments of the cybernetic metaphor in contemporary architectural design discourses are manifest\n\nin narratives of computationally enhanced design that characterize both designs and design descriptions\n\nthrough labels such as \"variation\", \"responsiveness\" and \"performance\", 510 showing that the cybernetic\n\nidiom is as present as ever. 5 11\n\n510 The meaning of these terms in contemporary design discourse is context-specific, multiple, unstable, at times\nexchangeable, and generally vague. Performance, for instance, can refer to the structural and material stability of an\narchitectural object, or to its energy expenditure, or to the moral value of a design process guided exclusively by\n\"objective\" criteria. I transcribe a couple of examples of contemporary cybernetic rhetoric in architecture: \"New,\nmore adaptive processes for generating form increasingly demand that we regard these forms as organisms in the\nliteral sense, capable of finding methods for optimizing themselves to fit their host environments.\" Verb. 50. And\nKas Oosterhuis description of his design methodology: \"This architecture is not static or unchanging, but more like a\ncomplex organism, which unfolds and evolves over time. Real-time input and exchange affects the shape, use, and\nappearance of their buildings and installations. The possibilities of these instantaneous processes can only be carried\nout after deep research and experimentation.\" (p. 182)\n511 Open Work offers very insightful thoughts on the migration of terms from science to the arts. About the use of\nterminology like \"indeterminacy\" and \"statistical distribution\" in aesthetic discourse Eco points out how it has often\nreceived negative response from \"purists\" (p.8 8 ). He also writes that terms used in aesthetic and philosophical\ndiscourse, like \"form\" and \"germ\", were also \"imported\" from scientific discourse. Eco takes that to indicate a\nconstant -and healthy- flux of knowledge that science makes available to culture (except that science is culture). At\nany rate Eco's account of the scientific aspiration of artistic practices in the second half of the twentieth century\nseems to be relevant to contemporary design cultures, always so eager to incorporate scientific discourses (see\nprevious note) into the \"rhetorical spaces\" their practice relies on.\n\n180\n\n\nAppendix C: JAVA/Processing code for Interactive Data Visualization\n\n// Dissertation chapter 7 data viz sketch\n\n// a visualization depicting the information flow in a BIM coordination process.\n\nimport java.lang.IllegalArgumentException;\n\nimport controlP5.*;\n\nControlP5 cp5;\n\nint knobValue = 100;\n\nKnob myKnobA;\n\nKnob myKnobB;\n\nRange range;\n\nSlider date-slider;\n\nfloat[] datesarray;\n\nPFont pfont = createFont(\"verdana\",20, false); // use true/false for smooth/no-smooth\n\nControlFont font = new ControlFont(pfont,200);\n\nvoid setup()\n\n// initialize picking buffer\n\npick-buffer = createGraphics(width, height, P2D);\n\n// initialize data structures\n\nissue set = new ArrayList();\n\niset = new ArrayList(;\n\ndates = new ArrayList));\n\norganizations = new ArrayList(;\n\nbuildings = new ArrayList(;\n\ndatecounter = 0; // keeps track of the active date, relates to the ArrayList \"dates\"\n\niset.clear();\n\n// initialize stage\n\nsize(MYWIDTH, MYHEIGHT);\n\nstroke(255, 255, 255);\n\nsmooth();\n\nnoStroke();\n\nbackground (0);\n\n181\n\n\nmyFont = createFont(\"verdana\", 10);\n\ntextFont(myFont);\n\n// initialize picking buffer\n\npick-buffer = createGraphics(width, height, P2D);\n\npick buffer.beginDraw();\n\npick buffer.noFill();\n\npick buffer.strokeWeight(2);\n\npick buffer.endDraw();\n\n// parse issues\n\nString lines[] = loadStrings(DATASOURCE);\n\nfor (int i=0; i < lines.length; i++)\n\n// creates an array with the comma separated elements of each line\n\nString values[] = split(lines[i], \",\");\n\ntry {\n\nIssue issue = new Issue(values);\n\nissueset.add(issue);\n\ngood issuescount += 1;\n\n} catch (Exception e) {\n\nbad issues count += 1;\n\nparse dates();\n\ndatesarray = new float[dates.size()];\n\nparse buildings();\n\nmake gui();\n\nvoid draw()\n\nbackground(0);\n\npick buffer.beginDrawo;\n\npick buffer.background(0);\n\npick-buffer.endDraw();\n\nselectedissue = -1;\n\ndraw rings();\n\nupdate info();\n\nif (iset.size() > 1){\n\nupdatedate();\n\n}\n\n182\n\n\n//void mousePressed()\n\n// testload random image();\n\n// SOURCE\n\nString DATASOURCE = \"clean_03.csv\";\n\nString IMAGEFOLDERPATH = \"/Users/Daniel/Dropbox/0 BUILDERSDATAVIZ/l\n\nCODE/bimviz/data/issue images\";\n\n// DATA STRUCTURES\n\nArrayList issueset;\n\nArrayList iset;\n\nwith date)\n\nArrayList dates;\n\nArrayList organizations;\n\nArrayList buildings;\n\n// this arraylist is contains all of the data\n\n// this arraylist contains only the \"active\" data (changes\n\n// this arrayList is to store the dates\n\n// this arrayList is to store the organizations\n\n// this arrayList is to store the buildings\n\nPGraphics pick-buffer;\n\nint selectedissue = -1;\n\nint badissuescount = 0;\n\nint goodissues count = 0;\n\nint date-counter;\n\nint vizmode = 0;\n\nDate activedate;\n\n// DATA FIELDS\n\nString FIELDS[] = (\"INDEX\", \"BUILDING\", \"LEVEL\", \"TRADE\", \"INT CODE\", \"DISCIPLINE\", \"DWG REF\",\n\n\"ZONE\", \"GRID Xl\", \"GRID X2\", \"GRID Yl\", \"GRID Y2\", \"GT CODE\", \"KEY\", \"ISSUE DESCRIPTION\",\n\n\"OPENING DATE\", \"STATUS\", \"ACTION BY DATE\", \"LAST CHANGE\", \"ACTION\", \"BY NAME\", \"ORGANIZATION\",\n\n\"RFI\", \"EXT MEETING DATE\", \"EXT.
