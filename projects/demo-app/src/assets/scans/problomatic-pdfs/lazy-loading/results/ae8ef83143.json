Ave., E14-433C, Cambridge, MA , USA Introduction Additive prototyping technologies have become an efficient and common means to deliver geometrically precise functional prototypes in relatively short periods of time. Most such technologies, however, remain limited to producing single-material, constant-property prototypes from a restricted range of materials. Inspired by Nature, where form is characterized by heterogeneous compositions, the paper presents a novel approach to layered manufacturing entitled variable property rapid prototyping. VPRP introduces the ability to dynamically mix, grade and vary the ratios of material properties to produce functional components with continuous gradients, highly optimized to fit their performance with efficient use of materials, reduction of waste and production of highly customizable features with added functionalities. A novel software approach entitled Variable Property Modelling is presented allowing designers to create structural components defined by their desired material behaviour. Research methods are presented and design applications demonstrated. Current technological limitations and future directions are discussed and their implications reviewed. Keywords: additive manufacturing; variable property fabrication; rapid prototyping; performance-based design; bio-inspired fabrication. The problem with current approaches to virtual and physical prototyping The use of additive manufacturing technologies for rapid prototyping takes as input virtual computer aided designed models and transforms them into thin, horizontal and successive cross-sections in the creation of physical three-dimensional objects (Sachs et al. 1993). These processes assume, however, that such objects are geometrically defined without necessarily considering their material makeup and composition (Oxman 2009a,b). The basic strategy behind additive manufacturing is typically to assign a constant material property to pre-shaped structural components defined as solids or closed surface polygons. Furthermore, both computeraided design tools aswell as rapid prototyping processes are not set up to represent graduation and variation of properties within solids such as varied density or elasticity. As a result, the design process is constrained to the assignment of discrete and homogeneousmaterialpropertiestoagivenshape.itisalsocharacterised by a methodological partition between virtual modelling and physical prototyping (Chua et al. 1999). Overall, current approaches to virtual and physical prototyping lack the ability to model and fabricate continuously varying material properties as part of the modelling and production phases respectively, resulting in material waste and structurally non-efficient prototypes. Towards a bio-inspired fabrication approach to virtual and physical prototyping Natural structures possess a high level of seamless integration and precision with which they serve their functions.

Oxman key distinguishing trait of nature s designs is its capability in the biological world to generate complex structures of organic, or inorganic, multifunctional composites such as shells, pearls, corals, teeth, wood, silk, horn, collagen, and muscle fibres (Benyus 1997). Combined with extracellular matrices, these structural biomaterials form microstructures engineered to adapt to prearranged external constraints (Benyus 1997, Vincent 1982). Such constraints generally include combinations of structural, environmental and corporeal performance criteria. Since many biological materials are made of fibrous heterogeneous compositions, their multi-functionality is typically achieved by mapping performance requirements to strategies of material structuring and allocation. The shape of matter is therefore directly linked to the influences of force acting upon it (Vogel 2003). Material is concentrated in regions of high strength and dispersed in areas where stiffness is not required. It is a well-known fact that in nature shape is cheaper than material, yet material is cheap because it is effectively shaped, heterogeneously distributed, and efficiently structured. Nature s ability to gradually distribute material properties by way of locally optimizing regions of varied external requirements, such as the bone s ability to remodel under altering mechanical loads or the wood s capacity to modify its shape by way of containing moisture is facilitated fundamentally by its ability to simultaneously model, simulate and fabricate material structures (Figure 1). The structural properties of wood, for instance, not unlike most biological materials, can widely vary when measured with the growth grain or against it such that its hardness and strength may differ for a given sample as measured in different orientations (Figures 24). Compared to manmade materials, many natural materials, particularly in the plant kingdom, mechanically outperform some of the most common materials used by engineers and architects. Woods have strength per unit weight comparable with that of the strongest steels; shell, bone, and antler have toughness an order of magnitude greater than engineering ceramics; and mature bamboo stalks have slenderness ratios which are remarkable even by the standards of modern engineering (Ashby et al. 1995). Yet Nature s materials are less than half as dense as many of these artificial materials and are characterized by very low weight and are functional for the plant to sustain (Niklas 1992). What are the attributes that make natural materials so effective? In The Mechanical Properties of Natural Materials, Gibson explores various classes of natural materials in examining the relation between their composite microstructures and their exceptionally high values of mechanical performance (Gibson et al. 1995). The function of these natural materials exploits their exceptional structural properties: woods and palms resist bending and buckling, silk stores elastic strain energy, muscle stores and releases elastic strain energy during locomotion, and so on. Such relations have significant implications for the design of mechanically efficient engineering materials: when considering beams and plates of a given stiffness or strength, or columns of a given buckling resistance, woods, palms and bamboo are among the most efficient materials available (Gibson and Ashby 1982, Gibson et al. 1995). Gibson reviews four classes of natural materials: woods, palm and bamboo, stems and quills. The results of the analyses suggest novel microstructures for mechanically efficient engineering materials for bending stiffness and elastic buckling resistance achieved by optimizing micro-structural organization to fit performance requirements such that the cellular structure can enhance performance for loading parallel to the grain (Gibson et al. 1995). Common to all these examples are the exceptional properties of natural materials arising mainly through novel cellular microstructures that make for efficient engineering materials (Figures 5 and 6). Nature s building blocks are therefore not as unique as their structuring in that it is not so much the material properties of the components as their arrangement within the natural composites, which give rise to such a vast range of properties. Thus we may postulate that Material Structure is an important design property of natural design as well as a significant body of design knowledge. A bio-inspired fabrication approach calls for a shift from shape-centric virtual and physical prototyping to materialcentric fabrication processes. In this approach, not unlike he bones remodelling process (Figure 7), the distribution of material properties is informed by structural and environmental performance criteria acting upon the component, and contributes to its internal physical makeup. It thus requires a set of virtual and physical prototyping tools and methods that support a variable-fabrication approach, not unlike Nature s. Aims and objectives The paper aims at introducing the variable property modeling (VPM) process as a general approach to the design of building components with graduated properties. In addition, the work will demonstrate a novel deposition technology, coined by the author variable property rapid prototyping (VPRP), which offers gradation control of materials within one 3D print with the aim of increasing mechanical efficiency and reducing energy input.

Recently, much relevant research in the field of tissue engineering has focused on generating complex polyhedral scaffold structures with such spatial gradients (Cheah et al. 2003a, b, 2004, Yeong et al. 2010). Indeed, damage and failure resistance of surfaces to normal and sliding contact or impact can be substantially controlled and modified through such gradients.

Given the significant potential of the ability to design and fabricate building components with varied properties (i.e. density, elasticity, translucency, etc.), supporting the integration of functions (i.e. load-bearing, natural ventilation, etc.) this work seeks the development of a modeling and a fabrication environment for products of industrial applications and architectural scale. Variable property design (VPM) is a design approach and a methodological framework by which to model, simulate and fabricate material assemblies with gradient properties designed to correspond with multiple and continuously varied functional constraints. Such capability has been termed by the author Synthetic Anisotropy and is characterized by the ability to strategically control the density and directionality of material substance in the generation of form (Oxman 2010a, Oxman 2010b). In this approach, material precedes shape, and it is the structuring of material properties as a function of performance that anticipates their form.\n                                            \n                                            8 Virtual and Physical Prototyping 9 Figure 6.

The objectives of the VPD approach are to enhance component optimization of material properties relative to their structural performance as well as to enhance the relation between modeling, analysis and fabrication protocols across media by providing a more efficient and integrated workflow.\n                                            \n                                            9 10 N.

Novel hardware environment for variable property rapid prototyping (VPRP) Variable property rapid prototyping (VPRP) is a novel method designed to dynamically mix and vary the ratios of different materials in order to produce a continuous gradient (Oxman, N, inventor; 2010 Oct. 5. Methods and Apparatus for Variable Property Rapid Prototyping; United States Patent Pending US 61/248,555). Inspired by nature, this ability expands the po-tential of prototyping, since the varying of properties allows for the optimization of material properties relative to their structural performance and for more accurate evaluations of the intended final product, such as stress testing. Dynamic gradients could also contribute to efficient conservation of material usage. The objectives of the VPRP technology are to enable the 3D modeling of building components with graduated properties corresponding to variable performance criteria as well as to enable the fabrication of building components with graduated properties corresponding to variable performance criteria.\n                                            \n                                            10 Virtual and Physical Prototyping 11 State of the art Virtual prototyping Layered manufacturing technologies work hand in hand with computer-aided design (CAD) software to allow engineers and designers to fabricate their designs. The process begins with a design or a sketch with set geometric parameters. Structural and behavioral characteristics of the design are taken into account by the geometry of the design from analysis and testing. Before the layered manufactured product is prototyped, however, the design must be reproduced in CAD software with all accompanying dimensional constraints to be sent out for fabrication. Traditional CAD software acts as a translator, converting a design on paper into a design understandable by a computer. The software application in this project, on the other hand, offers features that act as a platform for creative and structural design by allowing users to generate organic forms by mapping the distribution of various material properties across the expanse of the form. Designs are driven by its properties and material behaviors as opposed to its geometry. Layered manufacturing technologies have revolutionized the process of prototyping geometrically complex designs. And yet, the geometric modeling and CAD tools employed for such technologies have remained fairly traditional (Chandru et al. 1995). Current limitations lie in the developments of structural materials for fabrication; however, beyond such anticipated improvements, and in light of reported advancements in material engineering, major opportunities lie in the designer s ability within the fabrication process to control the variation of material properties as a function of external constraints (Pratt 2000, Shin and Dutta 2001). This requires the re-appropriation of computational tools for modeling, simulation and fabrication. The VPM approach, coupled with the VPRP technology, makes use of voxel-based graphics methodologies as an alternative template for variable property rapid prototyping. Various advantages of this approach such as elimination of the artificial.stl format, easy accomplishments of tasks like estimation of errors in the physical parameters of the fabricated objects, tolerancing, interference detection etc. have been reviewed in the literature (Chandru et al. 1995). This paper demonstrates an integrated approach to design and manufacturing promoting a direct link between virtual performance-based design and physical prototyping. In the following section we introduce some definitions considered essential to understanding the VPM approach and its corresponding VPRP technology, currently under development at MIT (Oxman 2009a, b, 2010a, b). Current CAD applications do not support the descriptions of internalmaterial composition. However, some options exist which employdigital entities capable of describingmicro-scale physical properties of materials and internal composition. Such entities include: Voxels Voxels are digital volume elements that represent analogous to 2D pixels whose position is defined by their proximity to other voxels. Voxels are thus good at representing regularly sampled spaces that are non-homogeneously filled and are used in the visualization and analysis of medical and scientific data but have yet to be implemented in the context of form-generation. Finite-elements (FEM/FEA) The finite element method (FEM) is a numerical technique for solving partial differential or integral equations over complex domains (such as cars, pipelines, and complex building skins). The aim is to simulate physical behavior under structural and/or environmental loading cases. The method operates by applying a mesh discretization of a continuous domain into a set of discrete sub-domains, usually called elements. Elements are predominantly small triangular features comprising the surface area of the simulated domain and can be individually analyzed. Particle system elements A particle system is a computer graphics technique to simulate physical fuzzy phenomena that are almost impossible to reproduce using conventional rendering techniques (such as the simulation of some, moving water, dust and hair). Emitters typically control particles, which acts as the particle s source and determines it location and motion in 3D space. The emitter has attached to it a set of particle behavior parameters including spawning rates (determining how many particles are generated per time unit), its initial velocity vector (emittance direction upon creation), lifetime, color and more. Vague discrete modeling elements (VDM) Vague discrete modeling is a technique, which supports the modeling of features, functions and methods of geometrical objects in associative modeling environments such that every feature is defined as a rule, capable of modifying its representation. The technique is vague in the sense that multiple objects are represented by one interval model, and that multiple shape instances can be generated based on certain instantiation rules. This allows the definition of an object s global shape while remaining the possibility to modify the shape in relation to constructive, functional, ergonomic or aesthetic constraints. The model is represented by 3D points representing its geometrical boundaries as sets of instances of object clusters. The outcome is a nominal discrete shape that is defined in terms of its typology, but its geometry is transformable depending on parameters defined by the user.\n                                            \n                                            11 12 N. Oxman The common denominator for these four methods is the representation of physical behavior and/or material properties by assigning properties to discrete features comprising the model, weather by using voxels, elements, particles or point-sets. One major disadvantage of all entities mentioned above is their consumption of computational power in calculations. Also, the editing of such formats is made difficult by the lack of a robust method to relate between them in order to combine and integrate modeling and analysis routines. Physical prototyping Layered manufacturing describes a method of manufacturing that uses information from CAD files to dissect a design into numerous thin layers and produce the item by successively depositing or bonding material to form these unique layers. Layered manufacturing is also known as rapid prototyping as produce time is short and objects of varying complexity can be formed without the design and production of a manufacturing system specifically for the object. Some examples of layered manufacturing include stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), fused deposition modeling (FDM), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), 3D printing, and electron beam melting (EBM). Since materials in layered manufacturing are limited and vary with the method used, objects produced from layered manufacturing usually undergo various secondary processes. Rapid fabrication (RF) and rapid manufacturing (RM) technologies have emerged, since the mid 1980s, as promising platforms for building construction automation (Jacobs 1992). VPRP defers profoundly from such similar fabrication technologies in that it aims to produce material organizations of varied properties. Generally classified by the material phase used in their extrusion whether liquidbased (i.e. stereolithography), powder-based (i.e. selectivelaser sintering), or solid-based processes (i.e. fused deposition modeling), consistent to all such technologies is the use of materials with homogeneous properties for prototyping and fabrication purposes. We review two technologies that are of relevance to the comparison with VPRP: the PolyJet Matrix technology, extruding multiple photopolymers simultaneously, and the FDM technology, an alternative solid-based fabrication process. While conventional layered manufacturing technologies have given us the opportunity to create complex works-like and looks-like models in relatively short periods of time, the technology is also very limiting, often reducing material selection to an array of highly brittle, inelastic materials. Objet Geometries, an international 3D printing company, recently introduced their Connex Series, a line of 3D printers that use Polyjet MatrixTM Technology to allow the creation of dual material prototypes. This technology has also allowed the generation of composite material prototypes of varying stiffness. However, single material, varying property layered manufacturing technology has yet to be developed. OBJET Geometries TM PolyJet Matrix technology, currently applied to their Connex500 TM 3-D printer, operates by using ink jet heads with two or more photopolymer model materials; OBJET s process is a dual-, or multiple-jet process which can combine materials in several ways, enabling the simultaneous use of two different rigid materials, two flexible materials, one of each type, or any combination with transparent material. Each material is funneled to a dedicated liquid system connected to the PolyJet Matrix block, which contains eight printing heads. Each material is designated two synchronized printingheads, including support material. Every printer head includes 96 nozzles. Preset composites of model materials are ink-jetted from designated nozzles according to location and model type, providing full control of the structure of the jetted material and hence of its mechanical properties. This enables each composite material, also known as a Digital Material, to provide specific values for tensile strength, elongation to break, heat deflection temperature, and even shore values. The materials are extruded in 16-mm thick layers onto a build tray, layer by layer, until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured by UV light immediately after it is extruded. The gel-like support material designed to support complicated geometries, is easily removed by hand and water jetting. However, OBJET s materials are extruded by preset combinations; they are distinct and cannot be mixed to generate gradient transitions (Jacobs 1992, Sachs et al. 1993, Chang 2004, Bartolo et al. 2009, Udroiu and Mihail 2009). Startasis fused deposition technology (FDM) operates by laying down a soluble thermoplastic polymer for support in parallel to the extrusion of the build material. Parts are created by extruding material through a nozzle that traverses in X and Y to create each 2D layer. In each layer, separate nozzles extrude and deposit material that forms the parts, and material that form supports where required. Another interesting and relevant FDM technology is Contour Crafting (CC), invented at the University of Southern California by Professor Behrokh Khoshnevis (Khoshnevis 2004). This technology exploits the surfaceforming capability of toweling to create freeform planar surfaces out of construction ceramics and concrete. The extrusion nozzle has a side trowel, the traversal side of which creates smooth outer and top surfaces on the layer, as material is being extruded. This side trowel can be deflected to create non-orthogonal surfaces. However, both FDM technologies presented above use only one material at a time such that variation in properties can only be achieved by fabricating multiple parts and assembling them post the\n                                            \n                                            12 Virtual and Physical Prototyping 13 printing process (Wasa and Hayakawa 1992, Zein et al. 2002). Most of today s additive fabrication technologies for the building industry serve as prototyping technologies; In other words, the output usually serves as a model representing the geometrical form of the component and is generally made from non-structural materials that are not robust enough to satisfy structural performance criteria. Furthermore, most such prototypes generally display plastic deformation over relatively short periods of time. Given their role as visual prototypes, such components are traditionally made from homogeneous materials, unified in their properties and behavior. Furthermore, certain additive manufacturing technologies are designed to support full-scale construction. Such for instance is the contour-crafting technology, which is designed to 3-D print habitable constructions made of concrete in relatively short periods of time (Khoshnevis 2004). However, such systems too are limited to using only one material per print whether structural (as is the case with RM technologies) or non structural (as is the case with RP technologies) without varying its internal compositional properties. The advantages of printing material with varied properties such as density or stiffness variation are most significant as they can potentially enhance the mechanical performance of a given component while reducing the overall amount of material required for its production. Accompanying an increased motivation in the production of structural and highly functional graded parts using additive technologies, and inspired by pioneering research into 3D fabrication of scaffolds for tissue engineering (Sun et al. 2004), the VPM approach aims to combine 3D printing with recant advancements achieved in material science and tissue engineering (Chua et al. 1999, Freyman et al. 2001, Cheah et al. 2003a,b, 2004). The distribution of material properties as a function of their performance requirements at micro structural scale is elegantly exemplified with the development and application of functional gradient materials (FGMs). Functionally gradient materials The term Functionally Graded Materials was developed in the mid 1980s in Japan in the design of a hypersonic space plane project where a particular combination of materials used would be required to serve the purpose of a thermal barrier capable of withstanding a surface temperature of 2000 K and a temperature gradient of 1000 K across a 10-mm section. The general idea of structural gradients was initially proposed for composites and polymeric materials in 1972 (Miyamoto et al. 1999) but it was not until the 1980s when actual models investigating the design, fabrication and evaluation of graded structures were proposed. In Material Science, functionally graded materials (FGMs) are characterized by the gradual variation in composition and structure over their volume, resulting in corresponding changes of the material s properties (Figure 8). Such materials can be designed and engineered for a specific set of functions and applications (Suresh and Mortensen 1998). Various approaches based on particulate processing, perform processing, layer processing and melt processing are used to fabricate FGMs (Figure 8). Functionally graded materials are a new generation of engineering materials characterized by compositional and structural variation across their volume unit, resulting in property changes in the material such as mechanical shock resistance, thermal insulation, catalytic efficiency and relaxation of thermal stress (Miyamoto et al. 1999). Spatial variation is achieved through non-uniform distribution of reinforcement phases (regions of space with unique chemical uniform and physically distinct characteristics). Reinforcements are inserted with different properties, sizes, and shapes, as well as by interchanging the roles of the reinforcement and matrix phases in a continuous manner. The resultant microstructure is characterized by continuously or discretely changing its thermal and mechanical properties at the macroscopic or continuum scale. In this way materials can be designed for specific functions and applications. Various approaches exist which are used to fabricate FGMs such as perform processing, layer processing and melt processing. The basic structural unit of an FGM resembles biological units such as cell and tissues, and is referred to as an element or a material ingredient. Bamboo, shell, tooth and bone are all made up of graded structures consisting of chemical, physical, geometrical and biological material ingredients. The concept of FGMs is revolutionary in the areas of material science and mechanics as it allows one to fully integrate between material and structural considerations in the final design of structural components. (Stoneham and Harding 2009). FGMs are applicable to many fields. In the engineering applications it is applied to cutting tools, machine parts, and engine components. Various combinations of these ordinarily incompatible functions can be applied to create new materials for aerospace, chemical plants, and nuclear energy reactors. However, the application of FGMs in product and architectural design construction scale has not been thoroughly researched and developed. Functionally graded materials stand out as a special class of materials characterized by the gradual variation in composition and structure over volume, resulting in corresponding structure-property relationships. Unlike any other class of materials, FGMs are designed materials, assembled rather than selected for a particular function or application. Given the designer s freedom to define the material microstructure based on its properties, any composite material could be made simply by varying the\n                                            \n                                            13 14 N. Oxman Figure 8. Graphic illustrations of discretely graded (left) and multiphase graded (right) microstructures of functionally gradient materials. Within FGMs, the different microstructural phases have different functions and the overall FGMs attain the multifunctional status from their property gradation enabling various multifunctional tasks by virtue of spatially tailored microstructures. microstructure from one material to another with a specific gradient. Such processes facilitate the designer with the possibility of combining the ultimate properties of each material into one. Generally approximated by means of a power series, the transition between the two materials is achieved by combining several discrete layers, each containing localized optimal properties. Here, the notion of units is relevant insofar as it defines the micro-structural property of the material relative to its attributed mechanical functions. The basic unit for FGM representation is the maxel (Miyamoto et al. 1999). Its attributes include the location and volume fraction of individual material components. The term maxel is also used in the context of additive manufacturing processes to describe a physical voxel defining the build resolution of a rapid prototyping or\n                                            \n                                            14 Virtual and Physical Prototyping 15 rapid manufacturing process, or the resolution of a design produced by such fabrication means. Computational definitions Domains Freeform design has seen an abundance of software packages supporting complex modeling environments in terms of surface and solid descriptions through BURBS and/or mesh architectures. Predominantly, the challenge in design has been focused around the geometrical description of form as property-less features to which material is assigned homogeneously in the process of fabrication. The VPM modeling environment supports the representation of solids as geometrical features described by their material composition. The distribution functions of properties across the domain are valid, but not exclusive, to that domain. Properties The VPM environment distinguishes between two classes of properties: discrete properties and variable properties. Discrete properties (DISC-props) are constant, and are assigned to areas of constant properties across the surface or volume area of the domain. Being independent of each other, discrete properties cannot intersect. For instance, when relating to the extreme cases of strength, a voxel cannot be defined as soft and stiff at the same time. Variable (VAR-props) properties are assigned for advanced property distribution such as the one discussed in the example above. Variable properties describe areas with gradient material composition across the surface or volume area of a domain. Distribution functions A distribution function will typically describe the fracture of a given property (i.e. strength, conductivity) as a function of location. The VPM environment distinguishes between absolute and relative distribution functions. An absolute distribution function is defined by a function and the distance to or from a given property. The function computes the relation between the relative distance, given by the user, and the property fracture. For example, the material is X times softer in Y times the distance from the boundary of the model across its length. The relative distribution function is defined by two properties and a function. From any given point, the shortest distance is calculated to the maximum magnitude of both properties. The structure of a nerve s dendrite for example, schematically represented in Figure 9, nicely illustrates the notion of variable properties across multiple domains: the outer layer of the dendrite is stiffer then its inner substance. Its inner substance displays variation in conductivity depending on the location of the electrical signal. In other words, the nerve displays variation both across its longitudinal section (in the length dimension) and its transversal section (perpendicular Figure 9. Schematic 3D model illustrating multiple variable property representation.\n                                            \n                                            15 16 N. Oxman to the length dimension). Such variation is incredibly difficult and challenging to account for in any 3D modeling software. In the example shown in Figure 9, the domain contains the geometrical representation of the solid itself, its properties include stiffness and conductivity, and its distribution functions compute the transition from stiff to soft regions and from highly conductive to low-conductive regions within the domain. Like the example above, many other products and building components require a rethinking of the modeling environment in order to achieve the ability to design and edit graded material compositions as the ones offered by functionally graded materials (FGMs). The limited functionality with current CAD systems is due to conventional fabrication technologies, which do not take graded properties into account. Methodology Variable property modelling is investigated as a theoretical and technical framework by which to model, analyze and fabricate objects with graduated properties designed to correspond to multiple and continuously varied functional constraints. In order to implement this approach as a fabrication process, a novel fabrication technology, termed - variable property rapid prototyping has been developed, designed and patented. Experimental designs employing suggested theoretical and technical frameworks, methods and techniques are presented, discussed and demonstrated. They support product customization, rapid augmentation and variable property prototyping. Developed as approximations of natural formation processes, these design experiments demonstrate the contribution and the potential future of a new design and research field. Design case studies and experimentation The variable property modeling (VPM) design approach was developed in conjunction with the variable property rapid prototyping (VPRP) technology. Given certain of the technical limitations still under development such as automated axes control of material deposition, the approach was developed independently of its complimentary and corresponding technology. The VPM approach is demonstrated and executed using existing software and hardware platforms, with the aim of demonstrating the principles of variable property modeling (VPM) in the design of building components, products and potentially larger constructions. Three design products are presented, each demonstrating the VPM approach in different scales while utilizing different modeling strategies for the control of material properties based on performance constraints. All case study projects are characterized by the ambition to integrate structural and functional performance requirements within one continuous surface. In addition, in all cases material property variation is limited to a pre-assigned range of stiff and soft materials. In this respect, it is the properties of stiffness and elasticity that are being controlled rather than density, as is the case in many natural structures. Chair design The chaise combines structural, environmental and corporeal performance by adapting its thickness, pattern density, stiffness, flexibility and translucency to load, curvature, and skin-pressured areas, respectively. A single continuous surface acting both as structure and as skin is locally modulated to cater for structural support on the one hand, and corporeal performance on the other. Multiple algorithms were generated that correspond to these variables such that stability is mediated with pleasure, and structural integrity with visual and sensual experience. In this light, the chaise celebrates the negotiation between engineering and experiential performance. It is a method, as much as it is an object of pleasure that promotes material and structural integrity with the physical act of sitting and lying down against a hardsoft surface. The traditional chaise is transformed here to promote lounging of a different kind. It is designed as a three dimensional object that provides for multiple seating positions each promoting a completely different experience. The cellular pattern applied to its entirety is designed to increase the ratio of surface area to volume in occupied areas where the body potentially rests. A pressure map study was conducted that matches the softness and hardness of the cells to cushion and support sensitive and high-pressured areas. By analyzing anatomical structures that cause concentrated pressures, the chaise becomes softer and flexible where pressure needs to be relieved. The relative volume of each cellular cushion is locally informed by pressure data averaged with values representing structural support and flexibility. Its density is informed by global and local mean curvature values such that denser, smaller cells are organized in areas of steeper curvature whereas larger cells are found in areas of shallow curvature. The chaise s natural relation of structural and sense datum is propagated in variable polymer composites offering a wide range of physical properties. Through these algorithms force conditions naturally propagate functionality. Stiffer materials are positioned in surface areas under compression and softer, more flexible materials are placed in surface areas under tension. State of the art technologies are applied here for the first time to cater for a large range of physical properties and behaviours. The surface patches are 3D printed using a new multi-jet matrix technology simultaneously depositing materials of different properties corresponding to structural and skin-pressure mappings.\n                                            \n                                            16 Virtual and Physical Prototyping 17 Splint design Carpal skin is a prototype for a protective glove against carpal tunnel syndrome. The syndrome is a medical condition in which the median nerve is compressed at the wrist, leading to numbness, muscle atrophy and weakness in the hand. Night time wrist splinting is the recommended treatment for most patients before going into carpal tunnel release surgery. Carpal skin is a process by which to map the pain-profile of a particular patient its intensity and duration and distribute hard and soft materials to fit the patient s anatomical and physiological requirements limiting movement in customized fashion. The form-generation process is inspired by animal coating patterns where instead of colours we are controlling stiffness variation. Ballet sneaker shoe sole deign Similarly to the two previous case studies, the design for a shoe sole explores the possibility of controlling material property variation across the surface area of the shoe supporting the sole. This process entails the layering or compounding of different materials to create a single entity, and is particularly apparent in the construction of performance footwear, where various polymers are strategically inlaid to meet the ergonomic and athletic needs of consumers. Digital tool development The VPM approach was developed independently, and in parallel to the development of the VPRP technology. Illustrated in this paper are two design projects which provided the guiding principles for a variable-property approach to design fabrication. In this context, the projects are considered case-studies for the generation of form, designed and fabricated with variable material properties that integrate and correspond to one, or multiple performance criteria. Methodologically, the development of the digital environments supporting the generation of these projects focused on the generation of texture-based computational algorithms applied to the surface area of each product (Figure 10). In the case of the first study, the chaise s, the digital tool assists the designer in assigning a voronoi pattern to the surface area of the product, while in the second case, Carpal Skin, the digital tool assists the designer in assigning a reaction-diffusion pattern to its surface area. Both surface-based textures promote surface subdivision and assignment of material properties to each element. While in the digital form-generation approach, the assignment of material properties is guided by element size and surface texture, the physical technology is characterized by the assignment of material properties to performancebased gradients classified by color. In the latter case, geometrical patterns are replaced with color gradients further translated into continuous mixtures of materials with varied properties. Physical tool development Both design projects used to demonstrate the VPRP approach were 3D printed using OBJET Geometries Connex500 TM. The Connex500 TM is considered the first 3D printing system able to jet multiple model materials simultaneously. It offers the completely unique ability to print parts and assemblies made of multiple model materials, with different mechanical or physical properties, within a single build, enabling users to create composite materials that have preset combinations of mechanical properties (Figure 11).

Oxman Figure 11. Pre-set combinations of Connex500 TM materials. Currently, multi-material printers such as the Connex500 allow for the 3D printing of building components designed with several material constituents. However, in this case each material is jetted from a discrete jet making it challenging to achieve gradient mixture and micro-scale continuous changes in properties. Figure 12. Chaise design informed by material properties assigned to pressure map registration, body form and body weight. volume in occupied areas where the body potentially rests. A pressure map study was conducted that matches the softness and hardness of the cells to cushion and support sensitive and high-pressured areas (Figure 12). By analyzing anatomical structures that cause concentrated pressures, the chaise becomes softer and flexible where pressure needs to be relieved. The relative volume of each cellular cushion is locally informed by pressure data averaged with values representing structural support and flexibility. Its density is informed by global and local mean curvature values such that denser, smaller cells are organized in areas of steeper curvature whereas larger cells are found in areas of shallow curvature. The chaise s natural relation of structural and sense datum is propagated in variable polymer composites offering a wide range of physical properties. Through these algorithms force conditions naturally propagate functionality. Stiffer materials are positioned in surface areas under compression and softer, more flexible materials are placed in surface areas under tension. State of the art technologies are applied here for the first time to cater for a large range of physical properties and behaviours.

Physical prototyping During the initial stages of the design, the texture inherits the geometrical features of the design as defined by the user. Such geometrical features are, in the case of the Chaise, costumed to fit body curvature criteria. The initial distribution of cells corresponds to the type and degree of curvature: smaller and denser cells are located in regions of higher curvature, and larger, sparser cells are located in regions of smoother curvature. Material properties correspond to both structural requirements (self stability with no additional Figure 14.

For the structural performance, a stochastic computational process was developed in which stiffer materials are assigned to vertical regions which work for buckling and softer materials are assigned to horizontal regions that work for bending. The probability of a material being stiffer or smoother depends on the angle defining the level of horizontality in the chaise (Figure 13). With regards to the environmental requirements, the relative height of each cell is defined by the degree of pressure mapped onto the Chaise such that softer and bigger silicon bumps are located in regions of higher pressure (Figure 14). The Chaise was fabricated using a multi-material 3D printing technology and assembled in 32 parts (Figures 15 and 16).

The chaise combines structural, environmental and corporeal performance by adapting its thickness, pattern density, stiffness, flexibility and translucency to load, curvature, and skin-pressured areas respectively. It is patterned with five different materials color-coded by elastic moduli. Stiff (darker colored) and soft (lighter colored) materials are distributed according to the user s structural load distribution; Soft silicon bumps are located in regions of higher pressure.\n                                            \n                                            20 Virtual and Physical Prototyping 21 human skin is designed in the same fashion and acts simultaneously as a structural and an environmental filter and barrier. In the very same way that load or temperature can be mapped in order to design structures that are highly optimized for their function, physical pain can also be mapped in the design and production of medical assistive devices such as pain reducing splints. Since the experience of pain is a very personal one, it is different for each individual. Pain is very difficult to define, and it is one of those conditions that are poorly understood by the western medical sciences. Carpal Skin is a prototype for a protective glove against carpal tunnel syndrome. The syndrome is a medical condition in which the median nerve is compressed at the wrist, leading to numbness muscle atrophy and weakness in the hand. Night-time wrist splinting is the recommended treatment for most patients before going into carpal tunnel release surgery. The main problem behind immobilized braces is that since they are mass-produced they often are too big, too small or too constricting in terms of mobilization. In this case, as is the case with most muscular and nerve-related syndromes, product mass customization as opposed to mass-production is crucial. Carpal skin is a process by which to map the pain-profile of a particular patient its intensity and duration and distribute hard and soft materials to fit his or her anatomical and physiological requirements limiting movement in a customized fashion. The formation process involves case-by-case pain registration and material property assignment. The 3D scan of the patient s hand, including its pain registration, is mapped to a 2D representation on which the distribution of stiff and soft materials is applied. This pain-map is then folded back to its 3D form and 3D printed using photopolymer composites. The mapping of required material properties and their assignment to the surface area of the wrist-splint is guided by a texture synthesis based on the simulation of local nonlinear interaction, called reaction-diffusion, which has been generally proposed as a model of biological pattern formation (Witkin and Kass 1991). In this context, the reaction-diffusion algorithm dictates the desired distribution of material properties (Figure 17). In this design context, the traditional reaction-diffusion systems has been extended to allow anisotropic and spatially nonuniform diffusion of material properties as a function of anticipated pressure on the surface area of the wrist (Oxman 2010a,b). Physical prototyping In this particular prototype, stiff materials constrain the lateral bending motion at the wrist, and can be identified by the oblique trajectory of dark and stiff materials. Soft materials allow for ergonomic wrist support and comfort through movement. The local thickness changes correspond Figure 17. Carpal skin.

Ave., E14-433C, Cambridge, MA , USA Introduction Additive prototyping technologies have become an efficient and common means to deliver geometrically precise functional prototypes in relatively short periods of time. Most such technologies, however, remain limited to producing single-material, constant-property prototypes from a restricted range of materials. Inspired by Nature, where form is characterized by heterogeneous compositions, the paper presents a novel approach to layered manufacturing entitled variable property rapid prototyping. VPRP introduces the ability to dynamically mix, grade and vary the ratios of material properties to produce functional components with continuous gradients, highly optimized to fit their performance with efficient use of materials, reduction of waste and production of highly customizable features with added functionalities. A novel software approach entitled Variable Property Modelling is presented allowing designers to create structural components defined by their desired material behaviour. Research methods are presented and design applications demonstrated. Current technological limitations and future directions are discussed and their implications reviewed. Keywords: additive manufacturing; variable property fabrication; rapid prototyping; performance-based design; bio-inspired fabrication. The problem with current approaches to virtual and physical prototyping The use of additive manufacturing technologies for rapid prototyping takes as input virtual computer aided designed models and transforms them into thin, horizontal and successive cross-sections in the creation of physical three-dimensional objects (Sachs et al. 1993). These processes assume, however, that such objects are geometrically defined without necessarily considering their material makeup and composition (Oxman 2009a,b). The basic strategy behind additive manufacturing is typically to assign a constant material property to pre-shaped structural components defined as solids or closed surface polygons. Furthermore, both computeraided design tools aswell as rapid prototyping processes are not set up to represent graduation and variation of properties within solids such as varied density or elasticity. As a result, the design process is constrained to the assignment of discrete and homogeneousmaterialpropertiestoagivenshape.itisalsocharacterised by a methodological partition between virtual modelling and physical prototyping (Chua et al. 1999). Overall, current approaches to virtual and physical prototyping lack the ability to model and fabricate continuously varying material properties as part of the modelling and production phases respectively, resulting in material waste and structurally non-efficient prototypes. Towards a bio-inspired fabrication approach to virtual and physical prototyping Natural structures possess a high level of seamless integration and precision with which they serve their functions.

Oxman key distinguishing trait of nature s designs is its capability in the biological world to generate complex structures of organic, or inorganic, multifunctional composites such as shells, pearls, corals, teeth, wood, silk, horn, collagen, and muscle fibres (Benyus 1997). Combined with extracellular matrices, these structural biomaterials form microstructures engineered to adapt to prearranged external constraints (Benyus 1997, Vincent 1982). Such constraints generally include combinations of structural, environmental and corporeal performance criteria. Since many biological materials are made of fibrous heterogeneous compositions, their multi-functionality is typically achieved by mapping performance requirements to strategies of material structuring and allocation. The shape of matter is therefore directly linked to the influences of force acting upon it (Vogel 2003). Material is concentrated in regions of high strength and dispersed in areas where stiffness is not required. It is a well-known fact that in nature shape is cheaper than material, yet material is cheap because it is effectively shaped, heterogeneously distributed, and efficiently structured. Nature s ability to gradually distribute material properties by way of locally optimizing regions of varied external requirements, such as the bone s ability to remodel under altering mechanical loads or the wood s capacity to modify its shape by way of containing moisture is facilitated fundamentally by its ability to simultaneously model, simulate and fabricate material structures (Figure 1). The structural properties of wood, for instance, not unlike most biological materials, can widely vary when measured with the growth grain or against it such that its hardness and strength may differ for a given sample as measured in different orientations (Figures 24). Compared to manmade materials, many natural materials, particularly in the plant kingdom, mechanically outperform some of the most common materials used by engineers and architects. Woods have strength per unit weight comparable with that of the strongest steels; shell, bone, and antler have toughness an order of magnitude greater than engineering ceramics; and mature bamboo stalks have slenderness ratios which are remarkable even by the standards of modern engineering (Ashby et al. 1995). Yet Nature s materials are less than half as dense as many of these artificial materials and are characterized by very low weight and are functional for the plant to sustain (Niklas 1992). What are the attributes that make natural materials so effective? In The Mechanical Properties of Natural Materials, Gibson explores various classes of natural materials in examining the relation between their composite microstructures and their exceptionally high values of mechanical performance (Gibson et al. 1995). The function of these natural materials exploits their exceptional structural properties: woods and palms resist bending and buckling, silk stores elastic strain energy, muscle stores and releases elastic strain energy during locomotion, and so on. Such relations have significant implications for the design of mechanically efficient engineering materials: when considering beams and plates of a given stiffness or strength, or columns of a given buckling resistance, woods, palms and bamboo are among the most efficient materials available (Gibson and Ashby 1982, Gibson et al. 1995). Gibson reviews four classes of natural materials: woods, palm and bamboo, stems and quills. The results of the analyses suggest novel microstructures for mechanically efficient engineering materials for bending stiffness and elastic buckling resistance achieved by optimizing micro-structural organization to fit performance requirements such that the cellular structure can enhance performance for loading parallel to the grain (Gibson et al. 1995). Common to all these examples are the exceptional properties of natural materials arising mainly through novel cellular microstructures that make for efficient engineering materials (Figures 5 and 6). Nature s building blocks are therefore not as unique as their structuring in that it is not so much the material properties of the components as their arrangement within the natural composites, which give rise to such a vast range of properties. Thus we may postulate that Material Structure is an important design property of natural design as well as a significant body of design knowledge. A bio-inspired fabrication approach calls for a shift from shape-centric virtual and physical prototyping to materialcentric fabrication processes. In this approach, not unlike he bones remodelling process (Figure 7), the distribution of material properties is informed by structural and environmental performance criteria acting upon the component, and contributes to its internal physical makeup. It thus requires a set of virtual and physical prototyping tools and methods that support a variable-fabrication approach, not unlike Nature s. Aims and objectives The paper aims at introducing the variable property modeling (VPM) process as a general approach to the design of building components with graduated properties. In addition, the work will demonstrate a novel deposition technology, coined by the author variable property rapid prototyping (VPRP), which offers gradation control of materials within one 3D print with the aim of increasing mechanical efficiency and reducing energy input.

Given the significant potential of the ability to design and fabricate building components with varied properties (i.e. density, elasticity, translucency, etc.), supporting the integration of functions (i.e. load-bearing, natural ventilation, etc.) this work seeks the development of a modeling and a fabrication environment for products of industrial applications and architectural scale. Variable property design (VPM) is a design approach and a methodological framework by which to model, simulate and fabricate material assemblies with gradient properties designed to correspond with multiple and continuously varied functional constraints. Such capability has been termed by the author Synthetic Anisotropy and is characterized by the ability to strategically control the density and directionality of material substance in the generation of form (Oxman 2010a, Oxman 2010b). In this approach, material precedes shape, and it is the structuring of material properties as a function of performance that anticipates their form.</p>\n                                            <noscript><span itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"8 N.

Novel hardware environment for variable property rapid prototyping (VPRP) Variable property rapid prototyping (VPRP) is a novel method designed to dynamically mix and vary the ratios of different materials in order to produce a continuous gradient (Oxman, N, inventor; 2010 Oct. 5. Methods and Apparatus for Variable Property Rapid Prototyping; United States Patent Pending US 61/248,555). Inspired by nature, this ability expands the po-tential of prototyping, since the varying of properties allows for the optimization of material properties relative to their structural performance and for more accurate evaluations of the intended final product, such as stress testing. Dynamic gradients could also contribute to efficient conservation of material usage. The objectives of the VPRP technology are to enable the 3D modeling of building components with graduated properties corresponding to variable performance criteria as well as to enable the fabrication of building components with graduated properties corresponding to variable performance criteria.</p>\n                                            <noscript><span itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"10 N.

The process begins with a design or a sketch with set geometric parameters. Structural and behavioral characteristics of the design are taken into account by the geometry of the design from analysis and testing. Before the layered manufactured product is prototyped, however, the design must be reproduced in CAD software with all accompanying dimensional constraints to be sent out for fabrication. Traditional CAD software acts as a translator, converting a design on paper into a design understandable by a computer. The software application in this project, on the other hand, offers features that act as a platform for creative and structural design by allowing users to generate organic forms by mapping the distribution of various material properties across the expanse of the form. Designs are driven by its properties and material behaviors as opposed to its geometry. Layered manufacturing technologies have revolutionized the process of prototyping geometrically complex designs. And yet, the geometric modeling and CAD tools employed for such technologies have remained fairly traditional (Chandru et al. 1995). Current limitations lie in the developments of structural materials for fabrication; however, beyond such anticipated improvements, and in light of reported advancements in material engineering, major opportunities lie in the designer s ability within the fabrication process to control the variation of material properties as a function of external constraints (Pratt 2000, Shin and Dutta 2001). This requires the re-appropriation of computational tools for modeling, simulation and fabrication. The VPM approach, coupled with the VPRP technology, makes use of voxel-based graphics methodologies as an alternative template for variable property rapid prototyping. Various advantages of this approach such as elimination of the artificial.stl format, easy accomplishments of tasks like estimation of errors in the physical parameters of the fabricated objects, tolerancing, interference detection etc. have been reviewed in the literature (Chandru et al. 1995). This paper demonstrates an integrated approach to design and manufacturing promoting a direct link between virtual performance-based design and physical prototyping. In the following section we introduce some definitions considered essential to understanding the VPM approach and its corresponding VPRP technology, currently under development at MIT (Oxman 2009a, b, 2010a, b). Current CAD applications do not support the descriptions of internalmaterial composition. However, some options exist which employdigital entities capable of describingmicro-scale physical properties of materials and internal composition. Such entities include: Voxels Voxels are digital volume elements that represent analogous to 2D pixels whose position is defined by their proximity to other voxels. Voxels are thus good at representing regularly sampled spaces that are non-homogeneously filled and are used in the visualization and analysis of medical and scientific data but have yet to be implemented in the context of form-generation. Finite-elements (FEM/FEA) The finite element method (FEM) is a numerical technique for solving partial differential or integral equations over complex domains (such as cars, pipelines, and complex building skins). The aim is to simulate physical behavior under structural and/or environmental loading cases. The method operates by applying a mesh discretization of a continuous domain into a set of discrete sub-domains, usually called elements. Elements are predominantly small triangular features comprising the surface area of the simulated domain and can be individually analyzed. Particle system elements A particle system is a computer graphics technique to simulate physical fuzzy phenomena that are almost impossible to reproduce using conventional rendering techniques (such as the simulation of some, moving water, dust and hair). Emitters typically control particles, which acts as the particle s source and determines it location and motion in 3D space. The emitter has attached to it a set of particle behavior parameters including spawning rates (determining how many particles are generated per time unit), its initial velocity vector (emittance direction upon creation), lifetime, color and more. Vague discrete modeling elements (VDM) Vague discrete modeling is a technique, which supports the modeling of features, functions and methods of geometrical objects in associative modeling environments such that every feature is defined as a rule, capable of modifying its representation. The technique is vague in the sense that multiple objects are represented by one interval model, and that multiple shape instances can be generated based on certain instantiation rules. This allows the definition of an object s global shape while remaining the possibility to modify the shape in relation to constructive, functional, ergonomic or aesthetic constraints. The model is represented by 3D points representing its geometrical boundaries as sets of instances of object clusters. The outcome is a nominal discrete shape that is defined in terms of its typology, but its geometry is transformable depending on parameters defined by the user.</p>\n                                            <noscript><span itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Virtual and Physical Prototyping 11 State of the art Virtual prototyping Layered manufacturing technologies work hand in hand with computer-aided design (CAD) software to allow engineers and\"><meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"designers to fabricate their designs.

Oxman The common denominator for these four methods is the representation of physical behavior and/or material properties by assigning properties to discrete features comprising the model, weather by using voxels, elements, particles or point-sets. One major disadvantage of all entities mentioned above is their consumption of computational power in calculations. Also, the editing of such formats is made difficult by the lack of a robust method to relate between them in order to combine and integrate modeling and analysis routines. Physical prototyping Layered manufacturing describes a method of manufacturing that uses information from CAD files to dissect a design into numerous thin layers and produce the item by successively depositing or bonding material to form these unique layers. Layered manufacturing is also known as rapid prototyping as produce time is short and objects of varying complexity can be formed without the design and production of a manufacturing system specifically for the object. Some examples of layered manufacturing include stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), fused deposition modeling (FDM), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), 3D printing, and electron beam melting (EBM). Since materials in layered manufacturing are limited and vary with the method used, objects produced from layered manufacturing usually undergo various secondary processes. Rapid fabrication (RF) and rapid manufacturing (RM) technologies have emerged, since the mid 1980s, as promising platforms for building construction automation (Jacobs 1992). VPRP defers profoundly from such similar fabrication technologies in that it aims to produce material organizations of varied properties. Generally classified by the material phase used in their extrusion whether liquidbased (i.e. stereolithography), powder-based (i.e. selectivelaser sintering), or solid-based processes (i.e. fused deposition modeling), consistent to all such technologies is the use of materials with homogeneous properties for prototyping and fabrication purposes. We review two technologies that are of relevance to the comparison with VPRP: the PolyJet Matrix technology, extruding multiple photopolymers simultaneously, and the FDM technology, an alternative solid-based fabrication process. While conventional layered manufacturing technologies have given us the opportunity to create complex works-like and looks-like models in relatively short periods of time, the technology is also very limiting, often reducing material selection to an array of highly brittle, inelastic materials. Objet Geometries, an international 3D printing company, recently introduced their Connex Series, a line of 3D printers that use Polyjet MatrixTM Technology to allow the creation of dual material prototypes. This technology has also allowed the generation of composite material prototypes of varying stiffness. However, single material, varying property layered manufacturing technology has yet to be developed. OBJET Geometries TM PolyJet Matrix technology, currently applied to their Connex500 TM 3-D printer, operates by using ink jet heads with two or more photopolymer model materials; OBJET s process is a dual-, or multiple-jet process which can combine materials in several ways, enabling the simultaneous use of two different rigid materials, two flexible materials, one of each type, or any combination with transparent material. Each material is funneled to a dedicated liquid system connected to the PolyJet Matrix block, which contains eight printing heads. Each material is designated two synchronized printingheads, including support material. Every printer head includes 96 nozzles. Preset composites of model materials are ink-jetted from designated nozzles according to location and model type, providing full control of the structure of the jetted material and hence of its mechanical properties. This enables each composite material, also known as a Digital Material, to provide specific values for tensile strength, elongation to break, heat deflection temperature, and even shore values. The materials are extruded in 16-mm thick layers onto a build tray, layer by layer, until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured by UV light immediately after it is extruded. The gel-like support material designed to support complicated geometries, is easily removed by hand and water jetting. However, OBJET s materials are extruded by preset combinations; they are distinct and cannot be mixed to generate gradient transitions (Jacobs 1992, Sachs et al. 1993, Chang 2004, Bartolo et al. 2009, Udroiu and Mihail 2009). Startasis fused deposition technology (FDM) operates by laying down a soluble thermoplastic polymer for support in parallel to the extrusion of the build material. Parts are created by extruding material through a nozzle that traverses in X and Y to create each 2D layer. In each layer, separate nozzles extrude and deposit material that forms the parts, and material that form supports where required. Another interesting and relevant FDM technology is Contour Crafting (CC), invented at the University of Southern California by Professor Behrokh Khoshnevis (Khoshnevis 2004). This technology exploits the surfaceforming capability of toweling to create freeform planar surfaces out of construction ceramics and concrete. The extrusion nozzle has a side trowel, the traversal side of which creates smooth outer and top surfaces on the layer, as material is being extruded. This side trowel can be deflected to create non-orthogonal surfaces. However, both FDM technologies presented above use only one material at a time such that variation in properties can only be achieved by fabricating multiple parts and assembling them post the</p>\n                                            <noscript><span itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"12 N.

Most of today s additive fabrication technologies for the building industry serve as prototyping technologies; In other words, the output usually serves as a model representing the geometrical form of the component and is generally made from non-structural materials that are not robust enough to satisfy structural performance criteria. Furthermore, most such prototypes generally display plastic deformation over relatively short periods of time. Given their role as visual prototypes, such components are traditionally made from homogeneous materials, unified in their properties and behavior. Furthermore, certain additive manufacturing technologies are designed to support full-scale construction. Such for instance is the contour-crafting technology, which is designed to 3-D print habitable constructions made of concrete in relatively short periods of time (Khoshnevis 2004). However, such systems too are limited to using only one material per print whether structural (as is the case with RM technologies) or non structural (as is the case with RP technologies) without varying its internal compositional properties. The advantages of printing material with varied properties such as density or stiffness variation are most significant as they can potentially enhance the mechanical performance of a given component while reducing the overall amount of material required for its production. Accompanying an increased motivation in the production of structural and highly functional graded parts using additive technologies, and inspired by pioneering research into 3D fabrication of scaffolds for tissue engineering (Sun et al. 2004), the VPM approach aims to combine 3D printing with recant advancements achieved in material science and tissue engineering (Chua et al. 1999, Freyman et al. 2001, Cheah et al. 2003a,b, 2004). The distribution of material properties as a function of their performance requirements at micro structural scale is elegantly exemplified with the development and application of functional gradient materials (FGMs). Functionally gradient materials The term Functionally Graded Materials was developed in the mid 1980s in Japan in the design of a hypersonic space plane project where a particular combination of materials used would be required to serve the purpose of a thermal barrier capable of withstanding a surface temperature of 2000 K and a temperature gradient of 1000 K across a 10-mm section. The general idea of structural gradients was initially proposed for composites and polymeric materials in 1972 (Miyamoto et al. 1999) but it was not until the 1980s when actual models investigating the design, fabrication and evaluation of graded structures were proposed. In Material Science, functionally graded materials (FGMs) are characterized by the gradual variation in composition and structure over their volume, resulting in corresponding changes of the material s properties (Figure 8). Such materials can be designed and engineered for a specific set of functions and applications (Suresh and Mortensen 1998). Various approaches based on particulate processing, perform processing, layer processing and melt processing are used to fabricate FGMs (Figure 8). Functionally graded materials are a new generation of engineering materials characterized by compositional and structural variation across their volume unit, resulting in property changes in the material such as mechanical shock resistance, thermal insulation, catalytic efficiency and relaxation of thermal stress (Miyamoto et al. 1999). Spatial variation is achieved through non-uniform distribution of reinforcement phases (regions of space with unique chemical uniform and physically distinct characteristics). Reinforcements are inserted with different properties, sizes, and shapes, as well as by interchanging the roles of the reinforcement and matrix phases in a continuous manner. The resultant microstructure is characterized by continuously or discretely changing its thermal and mechanical properties at the macroscopic or continuum scale. In this way materials can be designed for specific functions and applications. Various approaches exist which are used to fabricate FGMs such as perform processing, layer processing and melt processing. The basic structural unit of an FGM resembles biological units such as cell and tissues, and is referred to as an element or a material ingredient. Bamboo, shell, tooth and bone are all made up of graded structures consisting of chemical, physical, geometrical and biological material ingredients. The concept of FGMs is revolutionary in the areas of material science and mechanics as it allows one to fully integrate between material and structural considerations in the final design of structural components. (Stoneham and Harding 2009). FGMs are applicable to many fields. In the engineering applications it is applied to cutting tools, machine parts, and engine components. Various combinations of these ordinarily incompatible functions can be applied to create new materials for aerospace, chemical plants, and nuclear energy reactors. However, the application of FGMs in product and architectural design construction scale has not been thoroughly researched and developed. Functionally graded materials stand out as a special class of materials characterized by the gradual variation in composition and structure over volume, resulting in corresponding structure-property relationships. Unlike any other class of materials, FGMs are designed materials, assembled rather than selected for a particular function or application. Given the designer s freedom to define the material microstructure based on its properties, any composite material could be made simply by varying the</p>\n                                            <noscript><span itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Virtual and Physical Prototyping 13 printing process (Wasa and Hayakawa 1992, Zein et al. 2002).\"><meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Most of today s additive fabrication technologies for the building industry serve as prototyping technologies; In other words, the output usually serves as a model representing the geometrical form\"><img itemprop=\"contentURL\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://docplayer.net/docs-images/44/18700840/images/page_12.jpg\" width=\"960\" align=\"left\" alt=\"of the component and is generally made from non-structural materials that are not robust enough to satisfy structural performance criteria.\" title=\"Furthermore, most such prototypes generally display plastic deformation over relatively short periods of time.\"></span></noscript>\n                                            <p><span class=\"badge bg-blue-hoki\">13</span> 14 N.

Such processes facilitate the designer with the possibility of combining the ultimate properties of each material into one. Generally approximated by means of a power series, the transition between the two materials is achieved by combining several discrete layers, each containing localized optimal properties. Here, the notion of units is relevant insofar as it defines the micro-structural property of the material relative to its attributed mechanical functions. The basic unit for FGM representation is the maxel (Miyamoto et al. 1999). Its attributes include the location and volume fraction of individual material components. The term maxel is also used in the context of additive manufacturing processes to describe a physical voxel defining the build resolution of a rapid prototyping or</p>\n                                            <noscript><span itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"14 N.

Computational definitions Domains Freeform design has seen an abundance of software packages supporting complex modeling environments in terms of surface and solid descriptions through BURBS and/or mesh architectures. Predominantly, the challenge in design has been focused around the geometrical description of form as property-less features to which material is assigned homogeneously in the process of fabrication. The VPM modeling environment supports the representation of solids as geometrical features described by their material composition. The distribution functions of properties across the domain are valid, but not exclusive, to that domain. Properties The VPM environment distinguishes between two classes of properties: discrete properties and variable properties. Discrete properties (DISC-props) are constant, and are assigned to areas of constant properties across the surface or volume area of the domain. Being independent of each other, discrete properties cannot intersect. For instance, when relating to the extreme cases of strength, a voxel cannot be defined as soft and stiff at the same time. Variable (VAR-props) properties are assigned for advanced property distribution such as the one discussed in the example above. Variable properties describe areas with gradient material composition across the surface or volume area of a domain. Distribution functions A distribution function will typically describe the fracture of a given property (i.e. strength, conductivity) as a function of location. The VPM environment distinguishes between absolute and relative distribution functions. An absolute distribution function is defined by a function and the distance to or from a given property. The function computes the relation between the relative distance, given by the user, and the property fracture. For example, the material is X times softer in Y times the distance from the boundary of the model across its length. The relative distribution function is defined by two properties and a function. From any given point, the shortest distance is calculated to the maximum magnitude of both properties. The structure of a nerve s dendrite for example, schematically represented in Figure 9, nicely illustrates the notion of variable properties across multiple domains: the outer layer of the dendrite is stiffer then its inner substance. Its inner substance displays variation in conductivity depending on the location of the electrical signal. In other words, the nerve displays variation both across its longitudinal section (in the length dimension) and its transversal section (perpendicular Figure 9. Schematic 3D model illustrating multiple variable property representation.</p>\n                                            <noscript><span itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Virtual and Physical Prototyping 15 rapid manufacturing process, or the resolution of a design produced by such fabrication means.\"><meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Computational definitions Domains Freeform design has seen an abundance of software packages supporting complex modeling environments in terms of surface and solid descriptions through BURBS and/or\"><img itemprop=\"contentURL\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://docplayer.net/docs-images/44/18700840/images/page_14.jpg\" width=\"960\" align=\"left\" alt=\"mesh architectures.\" title=\"Predominantly, the challenge in design has been focused around the geometrical description of form as property-less features to which material is assigned homogeneously in the process of fabrication.\"></span></noscript>\n                                            <p><span class=\"badge bg-blue-hoki\">15</span> 16 N. Oxman to the length dimension). Such variation is incredibly difficult and challenging to account for in any 3D modeling software. In the example shown in Figure 9, the domain contains the geometrical representation of the solid itself, its properties include stiffness and conductivity, and its distribution functions compute the transition from stiff to soft regions and from highly conductive to low-conductive regions within the domain. Like the example above, many other products and building components require a rethinking of the modeling environment in order to achieve the ability to design and edit graded material compositions as the ones offered by functionally graded materials (FGMs). The limited functionality with current CAD systems is due to conventional fabrication technologies, which do not take graded properties into account. Methodology Variable property modelling is investigated as a theoretical and technical framework by which to model, analyze and fabricate objects with graduated properties designed to correspond to multiple and continuously varied functional constraints. In order to implement this approach as a fabrication process, a novel fabrication technology, termed - variable property rapid prototyping has been developed, designed and patented. Experimental designs employing suggested theoretical and technical frameworks, methods and techniques are presented, discussed and demonstrated. They support product customization, rapid augmentation and variable property prototyping. Developed as approximations of natural formation processes, these design experiments demonstrate the contribution and the potential future of a new design and research field. Design case studies and experimentation The variable property modeling (VPM) design approach was developed in conjunction with the variable property rapid prototyping (VPRP) technology. Given certain of the technical limitations still under development such as automated axes control of material deposition, the approach was developed independently of its complimentary and corresponding technology. The VPM approach is demonstrated and executed using existing software and hardware platforms, with the aim of demonstrating the principles of variable property modeling (VPM) in the design of building components, products and potentially larger constructions. Three design products are presented, each demonstrating the VPM approach in different scales while utilizing different modeling strategies for the control of material properties based on performance constraints. All case study projects are characterized by the ambition to integrate structural and functional performance requirements within one continuous surface. In addition, in all cases material property variation is limited to a pre-assigned range of stiff and soft materials. In this respect, it is the properties of stiffness and elasticity that are being controlled rather than density, as is the case in many natural structures. Chair design The chaise combines structural, environmental and corporeal performance by adapting its thickness, pattern density, stiffness, flexibility and translucency to load, curvature, and skin-pressured areas, respectively. A single continuous surface acting both as structure and as skin is locally modulated to cater for structural support on the one hand, and corporeal performance on the other. Multiple algorithms were generated that correspond to these variables such that stability is mediated with pleasure, and structural integrity with visual and sensual experience. In this light, the chaise celebrates the negotiation between engineering and experiential performance. It is a method, as much as it is an object of pleasure that promotes material and structural integrity with the physical act of sitting and lying down against a hardsoft surface. The traditional chaise is transformed here to promote lounging of a different kind. It is designed as a three dimensional object that provides for multiple seating positions each promoting a completely different experience. The cellular pattern applied to its entirety is designed to increase the ratio of surface area to volume in occupied areas where the body potentially rests. A pressure map study was conducted that matches the softness and hardness of the cells to cushion and support sensitive and high-pressured areas. By analyzing anatomical structures that cause concentrated pressures, the chaise becomes softer and flexible where pressure needs to be relieved. The relative volume of each cellular cushion is locally informed by pressure data averaged with values representing structural support and flexibility. Its density is informed by global and local mean curvature values such that denser, smaller cells are organized in areas of steeper curvature whereas larger cells are found in areas of shallow curvature. The chaise s natural relation of structural and sense datum is propagated in variable polymer composites offering a wide range of physical properties. Through these algorithms force conditions naturally propagate functionality. Stiffer materials are positioned in surface areas under compression and softer, more flexible materials are placed in surface areas under tension. State of the art technologies are applied here for the first time to cater for a large range of physical properties and behaviours. The surface patches are 3D printed using a new multi-jet matrix technology simultaneously depositing materials of different properties corresponding to structural and skin-pressure mappings.</p>\n                                            <noscript><span itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"><meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"16 N.

The syndrome is a medical condition in which the median nerve is compressed at the wrist, leading to numbness, muscle atrophy and weakness in the hand. Night time wrist splinting is the recommended treatment for most patients before going into carpal tunnel release surgery. Carpal skin is a process by which to map the pain-profile of a particular patient its intensity and duration and distribute hard and soft materials to fit the patient s anatomical and physiological requirements limiting movement in customized fashion. The form-generation process is inspired by animal coating patterns where instead of colours we are controlling stiffness variation. Ballet sneaker shoe sole deign Similarly to the two previous case studies, the design for a shoe sole explores the possibility of controlling material property variation across the surface area of the shoe supporting the sole. This process entails the layering or compounding of different materials to create a single entity, and is particularly apparent in the construction of performance footwear, where various polymers are strategically inlaid to meet the ergonomic and athletic needs of consumers. Digital tool development The VPM approach was developed independently, and in parallel to the development of the VPRP technology. Illustrated in this paper are two design projects which provided the guiding principles for a variable-property approach to design fabrication. In this context, the projects are considered case-studies for the generation of form, designed and fabricated with variable material properties that integrate and correspond to one, or multiple performance criteria. Methodologically, the development of the digital environments supporting the generation of these projects focused on the generation of texture-based computational algorithms applied to the surface area of each product (Figure 10). In the case of the first study, the chaise s, the digital tool assists the designer in assigning a voronoi pattern to the surface area of the product, while in the second case, Carpal Skin, the digital tool assists the designer in assigning a reaction-diffusion pattern to its surface area. Both surface-based textures promote surface subdivision and assignment of material properties to each element. While in the digital form-generation approach, the assignment of material properties is guided by element size and surface texture, the physical technology is characterized by the assignment of material properties to performancebased gradients classified by color. In the latter case, geometrical patterns are replaced with color gradients further translated into continuous mixtures of materials with varied properties. Physical tool development Both design projects used to demonstrate the VPRP approach were 3D printed using OBJET Geometries Connex500 TM. The Connex500 TM is considered the first 3D printing system able to jet multiple model materials simultaneously. It offers the completely unique ability to print parts and assemblies made of multiple model materials, with different mechanical or physical properties, within a single build, enabling users to create composite materials that have preset combinations of mechanical properties (Figure 11).

For the structural performance, a stochastic computational process was developed in which stiffer materials are assigned to vertical regions which work for buckling and softer materials are assigned to horizontal regions that work for bending. The probability of a material being stiffer or smoother depends on the angle defining the level of horizontality in the chaise (Figure 13). With regards to the environmental requirements, the relative height of each cell is defined by the degree of pressure mapped onto the Chaise such that softer and bigger silicon bumps are located in regions of higher pressure (Figure 14).

In the very same way that load or temperature can be mapped in order to design structures that are highly optimized for their function, physical pain can also be mapped in the design and production of medical assistive devices such as pain reducing splints. Since the experience of pain is a very personal one, it is different for each individual. Pain is very difficult to define, and it is one of those conditions that are poorly understood by the western medical sciences. Carpal Skin is a prototype for a protective glove against carpal tunnel syndrome. The syndrome is a medical condition in which the median nerve is compressed at the wrist, leading to numbness muscle atrophy and weakness in the hand. Night-time wrist splinting is the recommended treatment for most patients before going into carpal tunnel release surgery. The main problem behind immobilized braces is that since they are mass-produced they often are too big, too small or too constricting in terms of mobilization. In this case, as is the case with most muscular and nerve-related syndromes, product mass customization as opposed to mass-production is crucial. Carpal skin is a process by which to map the pain-profile of a particular patient its intensity and duration and distribute hard and soft materials to fit his or her anatomical and physiological requirements limiting movement in a customized fashion. The formation process involves case-by-case pain registration and material property assignment. The 3D scan of the patient s hand, including its pain registration, is mapped to a 2D representation on which the distribution of stiff and soft materials is applied. This pain-map is then folded back to its 3D form and 3D printed using photopolymer composites. The mapping of required material properties and their assignment to the surface area of the wrist-splint is guided by a texture synthesis based on the simulation of local nonlinear interaction, called reaction-diffusion, which has been generally proposed as a model of biological pattern formation (Witkin and Kass 1991). In this context, the reaction-diffusion algorithm dictates the desired distribution of material properties (Figure 17). In this design context, the traditional reaction-diffusion systems has been extended to allow anisotropic and spatially nonuniform diffusion of material properties as a function of anticipated pressure on the surface area of the wrist (Oxman 2010a,b). Physical prototyping In this particular prototype, stiff materials constrain the lateral bending motion at the wrist, and can be identified by the oblique trajectory of dark and stiff materials. Soft materials allow for ergonomic wrist support and comfort through movement. The local thickness changes correspond Figure 17. Carpal skin.
