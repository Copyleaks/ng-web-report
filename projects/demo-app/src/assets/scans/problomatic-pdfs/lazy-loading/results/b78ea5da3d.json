By nature, and in its rite,\n\nKEYNOTE\nESSAYS\n\nNeri Oxman\n\nthe practice of craft is informed by matter, its method of fabrication, and by the environment.\nAs in Nature, when creation begins with matter, morphogenesis, or the generation of form, is a process\nengendered by the physical forces of Nature. Similarly, in the framework of this essay, Material is not\nconsidered a subordinate attribute of form, but rather its progenitor. Such is the story of form told from\nthe point of view of matter, and it begins, unsurprisingly, with form’s predicament.\nOver the long trajectory of architectural design history, the design and production of artifacts has been\ncharacterized by a growing separation between form and matter. In contradistinction to craft in which\nmaterial and form are organically intertwined into a tradition of making, modern design and production\nhave historically evolved away from this integration, or in its absence, towards the compartmentalization\nof form-making as a process independent of its sources in material knowledge. At least since the\nRenaissance, with the emergence of architectural theories, form generation has become somewhat of a\nself-directed and autonomous body of knowledge. Within architecture and industrial design, the most\nculturally sensitive of the productive design fields, form has grown in both eminence and temporal\nprecedence in the design process to the point that the condition of form preceding materialization has\nbecome normative and virtually intuitive in contemporary design culture. With the exception of few\npioneering cases in contemporary design, the secularization and debasement of the material realm has\nbecome axiomatic. Materiality has become, within the logic of the modernist tradition, an agency secondary\nto form.\nThe Industrial Revolution lay open the door to machine-based manufacturing and mass production. The\ncreation of form was now to be conceived and created by the power of industrial automation, detached\nand independent of environmental forces and influences. The values promoted by ancient crafts (not\nunlike Nature’s way), pronounced by the integration of material substance and construction methods,\nonce within the province of the craftsman, were abandoned while in their place emerged a design practice\nbased on values of mass production. Fast, cheap, repetitive and modular building types and parts were\nsynonymous with Ford’s visionary dream. Industry’s victory aside, it appeared as if design’s propinquity to\nancient crafts and its design expressions as portrayed by vernacular forms of design was now doomed\nlost; and with it the intimate context of material technologies. Eventually, this non-material approach to\nthe design and the automation of construction were to be reinforced under the command of computer\naided design and engineering.\nThe Digital Revolution, which marked the shift from analog to digital technology, has transformed the\ndesigner’s drafting board into a digital canvas. Form, it seemed, was now divorced completely from the\nphysical reality of its manifestation. This new design space afforded much liberation in formal expression,\nbut it has also broadened the gap between form and matter, and made the hierarchical and sequential\nseparation of modeling, analysis and fabrication processes infinitely more pronounced.\nThe implementation and broad absorption of enhanced computational design tools in architectural practice\nhas, since the early nineties, motivated a renaissance of the formalist project in architecture; geometrically\ncomplex shapes became emblems of creativity in digital design environments and supported the design\nmastery of complex geometries in form-generation. This formal and geometric design orientation has\nalso addressed “free form” design and architecture along with their enabling technologies as part of the\nlarger design phenomenon of “non-standard” form.\n\n18\n\n19\n\n// Keynote Essays\n\nACADIA 2012 // Synthetic Digital Ecologies\n\nToday, perhaps under the imperatives of growing recognition of the ecological failures of modern design,\ninspired by the growing presence of advanced fabrication methods, design culture is witnessing a new\n\nmateriality. Within the last decade in both industrial design and architecture, a new body of knowledge\nis emerging within architectural praxis. Examples of the growing interest in the technological potential\nof innovative material usage and material innovation as a source of design generation are developments\nin biomaterials, mediated and responsive materials, as well as composite materials. With the growing\n\nMATERIAL GENERATION\nMATERIALITY AND MATERIALISATION AS ACTIVE DRIVERS IN\nDESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nrelevance “materialization”, new frontiers of material science and digital fabrication are supporting the\nemergence of new perspectives in architectural and industrial design. Thus the role of digital design\nresearch as the enabling environment of the transformation to a new age of material-based design in\nvarious design disciplines has become the cutting edge of computational design research. Here we are\nat the cusp of a new paradigm inspired by the Troika structure of craft, at the interaction of Materials\nScience, Digital Fabrication and the environment.\n\nMaterial Ecology is an emerging field in design denoting informed relations between products, buildings,\nsystems, and their environment (Oxman, 2010). Defined as the study and design of products and processes\nintegrating environmentally aware computational form-generation and digital fabrication, the field operates\nat the intersection of Biology, Materials Science & Engineering, and Computer Science with emphasis on\nenvironmentally informed digital design and fabrication.\n\nComputation, in its most basic meaning, refers to the processing of information. In this way, both\nin the complex domain of the physical can be considered computational. While there is a strong bias\ntowards the former in contemporary design, sporadic investigations of the later have also occurred\nin architecture. What is more rarely explored, though, is the territory where machine computation and\nmaterial computation potentially overlap, where they not simply co-exist but intensely interact in the\ndesign process. Over the last ten year this has formed a central part of the design research we have\n\nWith the advent of digital fabrication techniques and technologies, digital material representations such as\n\npursued at the Architectural Association in London, at Harvard University and more recently at my new\n\nvoxels (3-D pixels) and maxels (a portmanteau of the words ‘material’ and ‘voxel’) have come to represent\n\ninstitute at Stuttgart University.\n\nmaterial ingredients, for instance in the context of additive manufacturing processes. In other words,\ndesigners are now able to compute material properties and behavior built-in to form-generation procedures.\nCombined with the designer’s capacity to analyze structural and environmental forces, the enabled\nmediation between matter and the environment through fabrication appears to be as powerful as the\nethos of craft itself.\n\nContrary to most current uses of computational design and digital fabrication, this research is based on\na synthesis of form, material, structure and performance in a process of integral materialisation, which\nfinds its conceptual roots in the processes of becoming in nature: Natural morphogenesis, the process of\nindividual growth and evolutionary development, derives the complex organisation, structure and shape\nof natural systems from the interaction of system intrinsic material capacities and external influences\n\nThe ability to design, analyze and fabricate using a single material unit implies unity between physical\n\nand forces. The resultant, astounding articulation, performative capacity and material resourcefulness,\n\nand digital matter, enabling nearly seamless mappings between environmental constraints, fabrication\n\nemerges through morphological differentiation, the summary process of each element’s response and\n\nmethods and material expression (Oxman, 2010). Such unity—like that found in natural bone, a bird’s nest,\n\nadaptation to its specific environment.\n\na typical African hut and a woven basket - might promote a truly ecological design paradigm, facilitating\nformal expression constrained by, and supportive of its hosting environment.\n\nAchim Menges\n\nmachinic processes operating in the binary realm of the digital, as well as material processes operating\n\nIn contrast to the reciprocities characteristic for natural systems, the relation between information,\nformation and materialization in architecture is typically linear and, at least in regards to the genesis of\n\nUltimately, the faculty to author new forms of expression will depend on the craft triptych (matter, fabrication,\n\nform and its materialization, one-directional and hierarchical.

Thus far the advent of widespread and increasingly\nubiquitous use of machine computation in architecture had seemingly very little effect on this condition.\nWhile the integrative character of computational design has been extensively utilized for the inclusion of\nprogrammatic, structural, environmental or economic information, material information is hardly ever\nconsidered, let alone employed, as a generative driver in design. Especially in recent years one could\nwitness a widening conceptual gap between the generation of form in the realm of the virtual and its\nmanifestation in the physical world, Emblematic for this schism is the strange coactive development,\nwhere the ability of digital design to generate ever more exotic shapes has been facilitated and accelerated\nby the ability of digital fabrication to produce them. It seems as if the age-long predominance of shapeoriented representational design techniques based on explicit geometry and their direct, conceptual\nextension in most contemporary CAD packages still preconditions contemporary design thinking: Even in\notherwise progressive and behavior-oriented design approaches materiality is still conceived as a passive\nproperty of shape and materialization understood as subordinate to the creation of form.
