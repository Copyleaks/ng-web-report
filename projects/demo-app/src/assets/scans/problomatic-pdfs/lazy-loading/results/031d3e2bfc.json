INTRODUCTION\n\nIn the days of smart materials, functionally graded materials are fast gaining\npopularity. These materials are a combination of two different types of\nmaterial layers with a graded interlayer. These materials exhibit the\ncharacteristics of each individual material plus the new functionality. A\nfunctionally graded material (FGM) is a two component composite\ncharacterised by a compositional gradient from one component to other. In a\ntraditional composite, which is basically a homogeneous mixture of its\nconstituents the pure identity of each constituent is altogether lost and thus\nwe have to make a compromise between the desirable properties of the\nconstituent materials and our requirement. Since significant proportions of an\nFGM contain the pure form of each component, the need for compromise is\neliminated. The properties of both components can be fully utilised. For\nexample, the ductility of a metal can be mated with the refractoriness of a\nceramic, without any compromise in the ductility of the metal or the\nrefractoriness of the ceramic. Functional grading, can, also, be defined as the\nselective and reproducible adjustment of the microstructure of a material to\nthe setting of macroscopic component properties (eg. Hardness,\nstrength). The procedure during the development of the FGMs is a continuous\nchange of the microstructure at least by one spatial dimension. During the\ndevelopment process, the properties keep changing at every step, till the\ntarget is achieved. The concept of FGM was developed in Japan in 1984\nduring a space craft research project. Where a combination of materials used\nwould serve the purpose of a thermal barrier capable of withstanding a\n\nIJSER © 2015\nhttp://www.ijser.org\n\nInternational Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, Volume 6, Issue 3, March-2015\nISSN 2229-5518\n\n1151\n\nsurface temperature of 2000 K and a temperature gradient of 1000 k across a\n10 mm section[1]. However since then this concept has gained international\npopularity, especially in Germany which is famous for its technological\nadvancements.\nA trans-regional collaborative research centre (SFB\nTransregio) was established in 2006 in Germany in order to exploit the\npotential of grading mono-materials, such as steel, aluminium and\npolypropylene, by using thermo-mechanically coupled manufacturing\nprocesses. It is funded by the German Research Foundation.\nHowever the concept of FGMs is present in nature in the form of the human\nbone and cellulose. Human Bone is a mix of collagen (ductile protein\npolymer) and hydroxyapatite (brittle calcium phosphate ceramic). The yellow\nmarrow consists of fat which contributes to the weight and the red marrow is\nwhere the formation of red blood cells occur. A gradual increase in the pore\ndistribution from the interior to the surface can pass on properties such as\nshock resistance, thermal insulation, catalytic efficiency, and the relaxation of\nthe thermal stress. The distribution of the porosity affects the tensile strength\nand the Young’s modulus. The human bone has high strength at the surface\nas it gradually lowers toward the inside by altering the porosity. From an\nengineering perspective, the human bone is a remarkable material having\nunique material properties that has the ability to repair itself and to adapt to its\nmechanical environment\n\nIJSER\n\nThe basic building unit of FGMs are elements or ingredients denoted\nby maxel. The term maxel was introduced Rajeev Dwivedi and Radovan\nKovacevic at Research Center for Advanced Manufacturing (RCAM ) in\n2005.[3] The attributes of maxel include the location and volume fraction of\nindividual material components. A maxel is also used in the context of\nthe additive manufacturing processes (such as stereo-lithography, selective\nlaser sintering, fused deposition modelling, etc.) to describe a\nphysical voxel (a portmanteau of the words 'volume' and 'pixel'), which defines\nthe build resolution of either a rapid prototyping or rapid manufacturing\nprocess, or the resolution of a design produced by such fabrication means.The\nmaterials can be designed for specific functions and applications. The properties\nthat may be designed/ controlled for desired functionality include chemical,\nmechanical, thermal, and electrical properties.\nDepending upon the nature of gradient and microstructure , the FGMs may be\nclassified as[1].\n1) Fraction gradient type (Fig. 1a)\n2) Shape gradient type (Fig.1b)\n3) Orientation gradient type (Fig.1c)\n\nIJSER © 2015\nhttp://www.ijser.org\n\nInternational Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, Volume 6, Issue 3, March-2015\nISSN 2229-5518\n\n1152\n\n4) Size (of material) gradient type (Fig.1d)\n\nIJSER\n\nFigure 1. Gradation of FGMs (a) volume fraction, (b) shape, (c)orientation and\n(d) size [14].\nThere arevarious techniques by which FGMs can be manufactured depending upon\nthe cost savings and expediency. The most popular is Powder Metallury others are\npowder stacking, plasma spraying, slip casting, electrophoretic deposition and\nsedimentation etc.\n2. Tribology and Functionally Graded Materials\n\nTribology is the science dealing with friction wear and lubrication of contacting\nmachine elements in contact. Most of the mechanical failures in the world are\ndue to wear of machine parts either due to improper lubrication or due to\nadverse working environment. Some other factors responsible for tribology\nrelated failures are:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nHigh Loads, Speeds or Temperature\nImproper Lubrication\nMisalignment\nMishandling\nNo break in\nLack of anti scuff additives\nImproper Maintainence\n\nThe different modes of tribological failures, specially seen in mobility\napplications can be due to:\n\nIJSER © 2015\nhttp://www.ijser.org\n\nInternational Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, Volume 6, Issue 3, March-2015\nISSN 2229-5518\n\nI.\n\n1153\n\nAbrasion: One contacting body abrades the other or there can be a\nthird body present between the bodies in contac[11]t. For example,\nabrasive wear at the lower turning point of the piston rings in cylinder\nliners can be observed (Figure 2.1). The second cylinder liner has\nbeen damaged by piston seizure. This kind of damage is typically\ncaused by hard particles (e.g., sand dust) and deposits on the piston\ncrown.\n\nFigure: 2.1 Cylinder Liner before and after wear.\nII.\n\nAdhesion: During relative motion between the two bodies in contact,\nparts of the softer body can break and adhere to the harder body, thus\ncreating pits and parallel furrows. For example adhesive wear in the\nbearing (Figure 2.2) occurs when intimate contact is made over a\nnumber of small patches or junctions. During sliding, these junctions\ncontinue to be made and broken, and, if a junction does not break\nalong the original interface, a wear particle is formed. These particles\neventually\nbreak\naway,\ncausing\npitting\nand\nspalling.\n\nIJSER\n\nFigure: 2.2 Automotive Bearing before and after wear.\nIII.\n\nFatigue: Due to the above two modes of wear or due to the presence\nof stress concentration points as a result of manufacturing procedures,\nmishandling or environmental adversities cracks can develop leading\nto fatigue failure[12]. For example fatigue wear can be observed in the\ngear tooth (Figure 2.3). The metal removal by pitting, spalling and\ncracking can be observed due to cyclic loading during transmission of\npower.\n\nIJSER © 2015\nhttp://www.ijser.org\n\nInternational Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, Volume 6, Issue 3, March-2015\nISSN 2229-5518\n\n1154\n\nFig 2.3 Gear Tooth before and after Fatigue Wear\n\nIV.\n\nCorrosion: is the material removal or loss by oxidative chemical\nreaction of the metal surface in the presence of moisture. It can further\nbe either\n•\n\n•\n\nFrictional corrosion is a general form of wear caused by loaded\nmicro-movements or vibration between contacting parts without\nany water contaminant being present, although humidity may be\nnecessary. It may also be referred to as fretting wear.\nFretting corrosion is the mechanical fretting wear damage of\nsurface asperities accompanied and escalated by corrosion,\nmostly oxidation in air with some humidity present. It occurs due\nto many oscillating micro-movements at contacting interfaces\nbetween loaded and mating parts in an unlubricated contact.\n\nIJSER\n\nFigure 2.4 Fretting Corrosive wear in pipings\n\nFigure 2.4.1 Electro-corrosive Wear on Aircraft\nServomechanism valve\nThe high velocity liquid flow, stray currents\nand the galvanic metal\ncombinations cause electro-corrosive wear on the aircraft servomechanism\nvalve, Fig 2.4.1 appearing as corrosion pits.\n\nIJSER © 2015\nhttp://www.ijser.org\n\nInternational Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, Volume 6, Issue 3, March-2015\nISSN 2229-5518\n\n1155\n\nApart from these modes there are many other modes of wear such as erosive\nwear, percussive wear, electric wear etc, which are secondary to the above\nmodes. During the tribological failure of a component, the mode of wear at the\ninitial stage changes or transforms to another mode in the final stage.\n\nFigure 2.5 Normalized Wear Rates for Industrial Machinery\n(Wear Volume/Distance) x (Hardness/Load)[9]\nIn Figure 2.5, the term “design wear rate” has a value of 1 for the conditions\nthat will achieve the manufacturer’s projections for machine life. Industrial\nmachinery is designed to survive about 40,000 hours mean time between\nfailures (MTBF). Increasing or decreasing wear rates can result in far more or\nfar less than 40,000 hours MTBF. Some wear prone mechanical elements in\nmobility applications are:\n\nIJSER\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nAutomobiles: Valves, Piston rings, Cylinder Linings, Gears,\nCylinder Lifter, Bearings, Gears, Seals, shafts, Chain drives etc.\nAerospace: Rocket heat shields Rocket nozzle, Heat exchange\npanels, Spacecraft truss structure, Reflectors, Solar panels,\nCamera housing, Turbine wheels etc.\nMarine: Most of the marine transport are powered by diesel\nengines that use inexpensive, high-sulfur fuel. However, their\ncombustion products contain oxidized sulphur and water vapor.\nThese combine to form sulfuric acid, which is highly corrosive to\nthe cast iron cylinders and piston rings. This corrosion is\neffectively controlled by using highly alkaline-type cylinder\nlubricants that neutralize the acids.\n\nThus, about 90% of failures worldwide are due to one or the other kind of\nwear modes. This hinders in the productivity, functionality, efficiency and\neconomical viability of the application[10]. FGMs offer great promise in\napplications, subjected to high wear and friction under adverse conditions.\n2.1\n\nWear Resistant FGMs\nA low-cost functionally graded material would be ideal for wear-resistant\napplications in automobiles, aerospace and water transport machinery.

The gradation would enhance the\ntoughness of the ceramic face and also prevent ceramic-metal debonding.\nSuch a material would uniquely combine the following attributes:\n•\n\nHigh Wear resistance (ceramic face)\n\n•\n\nHigh Toughness (impact resistance)\n\n•\n\nEasy joint ability: weldable/ boltable to metal supports\n\nIt would be pointless in developing such a material unless it could compete\ncommercially with the wear-resistant ceramics currently in the market, with\nalumina at the bottom end and imported tungsten carbide at the top end of\nthis range. Unless this can be achieved, the potential benefits of bulk wearresistant tiles of metal-ceramic FGMs will remain an unrealised possibility.\n3. TRIBOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS OF FGMs\n\nIJSER\n\nMacro-scale FGMs offer a new method of surface engineering to produce\ntailored tribological properties. FGMs finds wide spectrum of utility in diverse\nareas such as electronics and communication, electrical, structural,\nbiomedical, aerospace, automotive, defense, and general engineering[7].\nSome of the wear resistant applications of functionally graded materials are\nhighlighted below:\nMobility: Functionally graded materials can withstand very high\nthermal gradient, this makes it suitable for use in structures and space\nplane body, rocket engine component etc [[8]. They are being used as\ncylinder linings, valves. Bearings. Gears etc. In marine transport also\ndue to adverse environmental conditions they are being used as\ncoatings.\nMedicine & Biosciences :Living tissues like bones and teeth are\ncharacterized as functionally graded material from nature [35], to\nreplace these tissues, a compatible material is needed that will serve\nthe purpose of the original bio-tissue. The ideal candidate for this\napplication is functionally graded material. FGM has find wide range of\napplication in dental [36] and orthopedic applications for teeth and\nbone replacement. The functional gradient nano hydroxyl apatite\nreinforced polyvinyl alcohol (nano HA/PVA) gel bio-composites can be\nprepared through a layer-by-layer casting method combining with\nfreeze/thaw cycles technology. NanoHA/PVA gel biocomposites have\nbeen a promising and excellent artificial articular cartilage repair\nmaterial. Compared to hydrogel-based materials such as poly(vinyl\nalcohol) (PVA), poly(lactic acid) and chitosan, nanoHA/PVA gel\nbiocomposites possesses superior bioactivity and mechanical\nproperties because of the nanoHA existence in the composites [4].\n\nIJSER © 2015\nhttp://www.ijser.org\n\nInternational Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, Volume 6, Issue 3, March-2015\nISSN 2229-5518\n\n1157\n\nDefense: One of the most important characteristics of functionally\ngraded material is the ability to inhibit crack propagation. This property\nmakes it useful in defense application, as a penetration resistant\nmaterials used for armour plates and bullet-proof vests [5].\nEnergy: FGM have been used for various energy and sensor\napplications such as graded thermoelectrics and dielectrics (e.g. thin\nfilms prepared by chemical solution deposition), piezoelectrically\ngraded materials, applied for broadband ultrasonic transducers, and\ngraded composite electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). FGMs\nare also used in energy conversion devices. They also provide thermal\nbarrier and are used as protective coating on turbine blades in gas\nturbine engine [1,2]\nOptoelectronics: FGM also finds its application in optoelectronics as\ngraded refractive index materials and in audio-video discs magnetic\nstorage media. They are used as tungsten–copper composites for\nhigh current connectors and diverter plates, electrodes for thermionics,\nphotocatalysts, advanced superconducting wires, optical polymers,\nmagnetic properties, liquid crystals, single crystals with tuned lattice\nconstant for X-ray mono-chromators. Other areas of application are:\ncutting tool insert coating, automobile engine components, nuclear\nreactor components, turbine blade, heat exchanger, Tribology,\nsensors, fire retardant doors, etc [2-4].\nCommercial and Industrial: Pressure vessels, Fuel tanks, Cutting\ntool inserts, Laptop cases, Wind turbine blades, Fire fighting air bottles,\nMRI scanner cryogenic tubes, Eyeglass frames, Musical instruments,\nDrilling motor shaft, X-ray tables, Helmets.\n\nIJSER\n\nThe list is endless and more applications are springing up as the processing\ntechnology, cost of production and properties of FMG improve [10]\n3.1\n\nFGMs in Mobility Engineering Applications\n\nAs FGMs are a class of composites that have continuous variation of material\nproperties from one surface to another and thus alleviating the stress\nconcentration found in laminated composites. The gradation in properties of\nthe materiel reduces thermal stresses, residual stresses, and stress\nconcentrations\" [7]. The most exciting realization of FGMs, that gradients can\nbe designed at a micro structural level to tailor specific materials for their\nfunctional performance in particular applications is being utilized in the\nfollowing applications, replacing traditional composites and pure metals.\n•\n\nAutomobiles & Railways: Some of the applications are\n(SiC-SiC) Combustion chambers,(AISiC) Engine cylinder liners,\n(SiCw/AI-alloy) Diesel engine pistons, (E-glass/epoxy) Leaf\nsprings, (AI-C) Drive shafts, (AI-SiC) Flywheels,\nRacing car brakes, (SiCp/AI-alloy)\nCrank shaft\nShock absorbers disc brakes and clutches,\nvehicle support surface.\nIJSER © 2015\nhttp://www.ijser.org\n\nInternational Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, Volume 6, Issue 3, March-2015\nISSN 2229-5518\n\n\n•\n•\n\n1158\n\nAnti Corrosive Coatings\nRailway axle, wheels, rail tracks, bulletproof glass.

Among the conclusions\nderived from the above analysis the foremost is the that most of the\ncatastrophes of machine failure can be avoided by fabricating FGMs as per\nthe requirement of the application and proper condition monitoring. FGM are\nbecoming one of the potential advanced materials for most of the tribological\napplications. Since the FGMs are produced to achieve a certain property\nrequirement in particular positions of a component, it is better to work out an\ninverse design in developing the functionally gradient materials for the specific\napplication or component. There is vast potential for the development of new\nfunctionally graded composites as well as new processing methods.\n5. REFERENCES\n1) Andrew Ruys, D.
