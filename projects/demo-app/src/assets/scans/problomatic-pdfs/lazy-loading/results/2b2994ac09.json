Such variations are traditionally achieved as discrete delineations in physical behavior\nby fabricating multiple parts comprised of different materials, and assembling them only after the fabrication\nprocess has been completed. Recent advances in Computational Topology Design (CTD) and Solid FreeForm Fabrication (SFF) are promoting the creation of building components with controlled micro-, and\nmacro-architectural features. The FGRP approach combines a novel software environment with a mechanical\noutput tool designed as a 3-D printer to allow computer control of material distribution within a monolithic\nstructure. Inspired by the integration of material, structure and form found in natural systems, this biologically\ninspired design approach allows for physical prototyping of graduated properties in product and architectural\ndesign scales. FGRP introduces the potential to dynamically mix, grade and vary the ratios of different materials, resulting in continuous gradients, and structurally optimized designs with efficient use of materials, reductions in waste and production of highly customizable features. The paper presents the FGRP technology as\npart of an overall integrated design approach to functionally gradient design fabrication. Two work-inprogress explorations of FGRP implementation are presented: a robotic arm able to 3-D print concrete with\ncontrollable density and a 3-D printer for UV-curable polymers exploring variable elasticity. Research methods and processes devised for its development are presented and design applications demonstrated. Current\ntechnological limitations and future directions are discussed and their implications reviewed.\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Background\n\n1.2 Problem Definition\n\nCurrent rapid prototyping technologies, specifically\nadditive manufacturing platforms, are limited in\ntheir capacity to represent graduated material properties. Their basic strategy is typically to assign material properties to pre-shaped building components\nsuch as concrete columns or fiberglass panels (Sachs\net al. 1993). Within the design process, this translates into assigning a material property to predefined\nsolids or closed surface polygons (Sheng et al.\n2003). Both computer-aided design (CAD) tools and\nindustrial fabrication processes are thus not set up to\nrepresent graduation and variation of properties\nwithin solids such as varied density in concrete, varied elasticity in rubber, or varied translucency in\nglass (Oxman 2011). As a result, the design process\nis constrained to the assignment of discrete and homogeneous material properties to a given shape\n(Oxman 2011).\nThe paper introduces a data-driven fabrication approach for designing and prototyping materials with\ngraduated properties inspired by functionally graded\nmaterials found in nature.\n\nFunctionally graded materials, which are materials\nwith spatially varying composition or microstructure, are omnipresent in nature. A typical crosssection of a palm tree will reveal radial density gradients corresponding to the bending stiffness instantiated across its height (Rich 1987, Gibson et al.\n2010); cancellous bone exhibits sponge-like cellular\ntissue with dynamic distributions corresponding to\nloading patterns (Gibson 1985, Keaveny et al. 1993).\nSuch natural materials offer material and structural\nefficiencies at various length scales (Ortiz &Boyce\n2008).\nIn contrast to natural materials and biological tissues, industrially fabricated constructions, such as\nconcrete pillars, are typically volumetrically homogenous. While the use and application of homogenous materials allow for ease of production,\nmany qualities - such as improvements in strength,\nweight, material usage, and functionality - could be\nobtained by the development and application of\nfunctionally graded materials at the product and architectural scales.\n\n2 AIMS & OBJECTIVES\n2.1 Developing a New Fabrication Approach\nThe mechanical response of materials designed and\nengineered with spatial gradients in composition and\nstructure is of considerable significance in diverse\ndisciplines such as biomechanics, fracture\nmechanics, optoelectronics, geology, tribology,\nnanotechnology, product engineering and even\narchitectural design (Miyamoto 1999). Damage and\nfailure resistance of surfaces to normal and sliding\ncontact or impact can be substantially controlled and\nmodified through such gradients. Graded materials\nhold a profound place in the future of material\nengineering; the ability to synthetically engineer and\nfabricate products with material gradients using\nadditive fabrication offers improvements in\nstructural and environmental performance, enhances\nmaterial efficiency, promotes material economy and\noptimizes material distribution (Markworth et al.\n1995). These processes however, are known to exist\npredominantly at the micro scale, and are well\nknown in fields such as tissue engineering (Fan et al.\n2000, Yang et al. 2002, Yeong et al. 2004).\nGiven the significant potential of the ability to\ndesign and fabricate building components with\nvaried\nproperties\n(i.e.\ndensity,\nelasticity,\ntranslucency, etc.) supporting the integration of\nfunctions (i.e. load-bearing, natural ventilation, etc.),\nthis work seeks to develop modeling and fabrication\nenvironments for functionally graded products of\nindustrial application and architectural scale.\nThe paper aims to introduce the Functionally\nGraded Fabrication (FGF) process as a general\napproach to the design of structural components with\ngraduated properties. In addition, the work will\ndemonstrate a novel deposition technology, coined\nby the authors Functionally Graded Rapid\nPrototyping (FGRP). This technological framework\noffers gradation control of materials within one 3-D\nprint with the aim of increasing mechanical\nefficiency and reducing energy input in the product’s\ngeneration and lifespan.\nWe introduce the application of this approach in\ntwo material contexts – polymers and concrete –\nwith the aim of enabling 3-D rapid prototyping of\nstructural components with variable properties\ncorresponding to structural, functional, and\nenvironmental conditions.\n\n2.2 Developing Novel Design and Fabrication\nProcesses Using FGRP\nThe aim is to produce an automated tool able to dynamically mix and vary the ratios of different component materials in order to produce complex continuous gradients in monolithic structures. Two\nseparate examples of FGRP-based processes are being developed: a variable-density concrete system\nand a variable-elasticity polymer system. We report\nupon work-in-progress for the utilization of this approach in product-design scales, and speculate on its\nfurther development and automation.\n3 STATE OF THE ART\n3.1 Comparison to Existing RP Technologies and\nPrior Arts\nRapid Fabrication (RF) and Rapid Manufacturing\n(RM) technologies have emerged, since the mid\n1980’s, as promising platforms for building\nconstruction automation (Jacobs 1992). The FGF\napproach and potential technologies defer\nprofoundly from current additive fabrication\ntechnologies in that they aim to produce material\norganizations of varied properties. Generally\nclassified by the material phase used in their\nextrusion\n–\nwhether\nliquid-based\n(e.g.\nstereolithography), powder-based (e.g. selectivelaser sintering), or solid-based processes (e.g. fused\ndeposition modeling) – consistent to all such\ntechnologies is the use of materials with\nhomogeneous properties for prototyping and\nfabrication purposes (Jacobs 1992, Gibson &Shi\n1997, Weiss et al. 1997). An expanded review of\nprior arts is provided in (Oxman 2011).\n3.2 Functionally Graded Materials\nThe general idea of structural gradients was initially\nproposed for composites and polymeric materials in\n1972 (Miyamoto et al. 1999), but it was not until the\n1980’s that actual models investigating the design,\nfabrication and evaluation of graded structures were\nproposed.\nFunctionally Graded Materials (FGMs) are\ncharacterized by the gradual variation in\ncomposition and structure over their volume,\nresulting in corresponding changes in material\nproperties. Such materials can be designed and\nengineered for a specific set of functions and\napplications. Various approaches based on\nparticulate processing, preform processing, layer\nprocessing and melt processing are used to fabricate\nFGMs.\n\n4.2 Design Applications\nPotential design applications for Functionally\nGraded Rapid Prototyping occupy a vast range of\npossibilities in medical device design, product design, and architectural design (Oxman 2007, Oxman\n2009). We present two examples facilitated by the\nFGF approach: Beast, a prototype for a Chaise\nLounge, is a 3-D printed chair. It combines structural, environmental and corporeal performance by\nadapting its thickness, pattern density, stiffness,\nflexibility and translucency to load, curvature, and\nskin-pressured areas respectively. A single continuous surface acting both as structure and as skin is\nlocally modulated to cater for structural support on\nthe one hand, and corporeal performance on the\nother.\n\nFigure 1. Graphic illustrations of discretely graded (top) and\nmultiphase graded (bottom) microstructures of functionally\ngraded materials. Within FGMs, the different micro-structural\nphases have different functions; the overall FGMs attain their\nmultifunctional status from their property gradation, thus\nenabling various multifunctional tasks by virtue of spatially\ntailored microstructures.\n\nPREVIOUS WORK & APPLICATIONS\n4.1 Variable-Property Design Fabrication\n\nFigure 3. Variable stiffness and elasticity as demonstrated by\nBeast. Prototype for a Chaise Lounge. 2008. Boston Museum\nof Science.\n\nPrevious work has been carried out setting up the\ntheoretical, methodological, and technical foundations for Variable Property Design Fabrication (Oxman 2010).\nA variable-property 3-D printing prototype able\nto dynamically mix and vary the ratios of different\nmaterials in order to produce a continuous gradient\nin a 3-D printed part was developed. This project\nestablishes a novel nozzle design coupled with a\nmixing chamber that can produce a continuous gradient, using colors as a substitute for material properties (Oxman 2010, Oxman 2011).\nFigure 4. Variable thickness and elasticity as demonstrated by\nCarpal Skin. Prototype for medical splint. 2008. Boston Museum of Science.\n\nFigure 2. Physical prototype of Variable-Property 3-D printer.\n\nCarpal skin is a process by which to map the\npain-profile of a particular patient – its intensity and\nduration - and distribute hard and soft materials to fit\nthe patient’s anatomical and physiological requirements limiting movement in a customized fashion.\n\nThe formation process involves case-by-case pain\nregistration and material property assignment. The\n3-D scan of the patient’s hand, including its pain\nregistration, is mapped to a 2-D representation on\nwhich the distribution of elastic modulus is applied.\nThis pain-map is then folded back to its 3-D form\nand 3-D printed using photopolymer composites\n(Oxman 2010).\n5 METHODOLOGY\n5.1 Biologically-inspired Rapid Fabrication\nPrevious work and current work reported upon in\nthis paper are developed and implemented following\nresearch into biological systems and natural formation processes. Rather than a product-oriented approach to fabrication, we devise a process-oriented\napproach mimicking the formation of tissue and\nnatural material property variation as explored in\nmuscle (i.e. variable elasticity), or bone tissue (i.e.\nvariable density).\nMaterial formation processes found in nature do\nnot operate by the same logic traditionally applied in\ndigital design processes and rapid fabrication platforms, such as additive manufacturing (Sarikaya\n1999). Nature constructs solid objects by means of\nlocal processes using unformed locally available raw\nmaterials (Vincent et al, 2006). Demonstrably sustainable, natural structures possess the highest level\nof seamless integration and precision with which\nthey serve their functions (Oxman 2010). A key distinguishing trait of nature’s designs is the capability\nin the biological world to generate complex structures of organic or inorganic multifunctional composites designed with variable properties observed,\nfor example, in the way in which fibers are oriented\nin wood or mechanisms by which calcium is distributed in the bone as illustrated below (Benyus 1997,\nGibson & Ashby 1982, Freyman et al. 2001). Combined with extracellular matrices, these structural\nbiomaterials form microstructures engineered to\nadapt to prearranged external constraints introduced\nupon them during growth or throughout their life\nspan (Vincent 1982). Such constraints generally include combinations of structural and environmental\nperformance (Gibson & Ashby, 1982, Vincent 1982,\nVogel 2003). Since all biological materials are made\nof fibers, their multi-functionality often occurs at the\nmicro or nano scale and is typically achieved by\nmapping performance requirements to strategies of\nmaterial structuring and allocation; material is concentrated in regions of high strength and dispersed in\nareas where maximal stiffness is not required. The\nshape of matter is therefore directly linked to the influences of forces acting upon it (Neville 1993, Vogel 2003).\n\n6 3-D PRINTING VARIABLE DENSITY\nCONCRETE\n6.1 Variable Density Concrete Foam Fabrication\nPresented in this section is work-in-progress for the\nrapid fabrication of variable-density cement foams.\nFirst prototypes are presented illustrating foams of\nvarying densities using aluminum powder admixtures. The project is motivated by the hypothesis that\ndensity gradients in structural building components\nmade of concrete may increase the strength of a\nstructural component while reducing material waste.\n6.2 Biological Inspiration\n\nFigure 5. Left: radial density in palm-tree stem; Right: variable\ndensity in spongy bone. Palm tree cross-section image from the\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n(FAO, 1996).\n\nThe work is inspired by load-induced variable densities found in cancellous bone and by radial-gradient\ndensities found in palm tree stems. Palm trees maintain a roughly uniform diameter along their height\nby thickening the cell walls in certain regions, producing radial density gradients across the surface\nand volume area of the stem. The density is highest\nat the peripheries and lowest in the center, for example with densities ranging from 100-1000 kg/m3 in a\nsingle stem of the Iriartea gigantea (Rich 1987).\n6.3 Variable-Density Graded Fabrication of\nConcrete and Cement Foams\nThe aim is to design a novel rapid fabrication apparatus able to dynamically vary cellular materials corresponding to any given structural constraints. The\nfollowing work focuses on cement and concrete\nfoams where the density is controlled through an\nadmixture of aluminum powder and lime, which react to produce hydrogen gas bubbles.\nCompression samples of Type III Portland cement\nfoams with varying density were produced and\nmeasurements of material density, pore size, and\nmechanical properties were taken using mass measurements, micrograph image analysis, and compressive strength testing, respectively. Measured foam\ndata agrees well with existing data on cement foams\nmade with a protein-based foaming agent (Tonyan\n1991).\n\nture with either an aluminum foaming admixture or\na protein-based foaming agent. The use of a 6-axes\nrobotic arm offers complete positional and angular\ncontrol of the extruder head, generating interesting\nfabrication possibilities utilizing a setup similar to\ncurrent fused deposition modeling technologies. Additional material properties, such as aggregate ratios\nand optical properties (Figure 6) can also be controlled through dynamic mixing.\n\nFigure 6. Left: Radial density gradient in a concrete sample\nproduced by varying ratio of foaming agent (aluminum powder). Top right: Linear density gradient in a concrete sample\nwith the center of gravity highlighted by the pivot point. Bottom right: Functional gradients of other various properties such\nas aggregate ratios (top), color/optical properties (bottom), and\nother material properties are possible. Samples made using\nType III Portland cement and fly ash as the base material and\nwere made with assistance from Timothy Cooke of the Building Technology program at MIT.\n\nThe porosity was able to be controlled by the proportion of aluminum in the mixture; past an optimum amount the porosity decreased as the ratio of\naluminum to cement increased. The maximum porosity achieved was 40% using a weight ratio of 1.2\ng/kg aluminum to dry cement mix. The compressive\ntesting results strongly agree with the exponential\nceramic strength model, with a found value of q =\n5.4, compared to the q value of 7 found in the literature (Rice 1976). The implications of radial density\ngradients in concrete foams were explored and theoretical calculations using the experimentally found\nmechanical properties show that for a cylinder under\nbending stress, a graded beam can have 9% less\nmass than a solid cylindrical beam of the same dimensions and support the same load. This is\nachieved by grading the radial density to set the tensile strength equal to the tensile stress generated by\nthe bending load (while maintaining a shear stress\nlower than the shear strength to ensure failure in\nbending). This creates a more efficient use of material by optimizing bending stiffness relative to\nweight.\n6.4 Work-In-Progress: Automating Variable-Density\nRapid Fabrication\nCurrent work-in-progress looks into the controlled\nautomation of density gradients in concrete using a\nrobotic platform. Through the use of a dynamic mixing chamber and extrusion head mounted on a robotic arm (a 6-axes KUKA arm), we aim to 3-D\nprint concrete with controllable density. This demonstrate of FGRP will use a rapid-set concrete mix-\n\n7 3-D PRINTING OF U-V CURABLE\nPOLYMERS WITH VARIABLE ELASTICITY\n7.1 Variable-Elasticity Fabrication\nPresented here is work-in-progress for the rapid\nfabrication of functionally graded monolithic\npolymer products. The ability to 3-D print products\nwith controllable gradients in material properties\nmay allow for more optimized designs as well as\nreductions in the stresses and strains commonly\npresent at the interface between materials of\ndifferent properties.\n7.2 Biological Inspiration\nBiological structures are capable of transitioning\nseamlessly between materials of different\ncompositions, properties, and microstructures.\nNatural materials such as human cartilage and many\ntypes of bird beaks exemplify how spatial variations\nin density and stiffness can help optimize the\nresponse of structures to environmental and\nmechanical constraints. The goal is to mimic these\nsystems by developing a 3-D printer that is capable\nnot only of producing multi-material structures with\nan incredibly wide range of mechanical properties,\nbut also of stretching the current boundaries of\nhuman design and product manufacturing.\n7.3 Biologically-Inspired Variable-Elasticity Graded\nFabrication\nIn many biological systems, the physical properties\nof the materials are determined by the chemical\ncomposition and microstructure of its matrix. In soft\ncollagenous tissues such as cartilage, for example,\nthe mechanical behavior of the matrix is determined\nby the amount and crimp of the collagen it contains.\nExperimentally, increased ratios of collagen to\nproteoglycan in the cartilage matrix correspond to\nhigher tensile moduli (Williamson 2003). We are\ncurrently in the process of developing polymer\nmixtures that, when combined in different ratios,\nproduce blends with broad ranges of customizable\nmechanical properties. Shown in Figure 7 are\nexamples of silicone and polyurethane samples\n\ncontaining gradients in hardness produced through\nblended casting.\n\nmechanical stimuli, and overall improved product\nlife spans.\nFinally, it is expected that in parallel to the emerging\ncapabilities of multi-material, freeform fabrication,\nmaterials with a wide range of mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties will soon be\nseamlessly 3-D printed. Indeed as of today, traditional CAD programs are inadequate in efficiently\nutilizing this vast design potential. In this research,\nwe have outlined an approach and demonstrated the\nfirst steps in the design of a complimentary approach\nand potential technology acting as an additive digital\nfabrication platform supporting continuous cellular\nand elasticity gradients within a structural component to meet high level functional goals.\n\n\nFigure 7. Samples generated by combining UV curable silicones and polyurethanes with various properties in a gradient\nacross each sample.\n\n7.4 Work-In-Progress: Automating VariableElasticity Rapid Fabrication\nBy controlling the ratios in which two or more\npolymers are mixed immediately prior to deposition\nand UV curing, monolithic structures with functional\ngradients can be produced using additive fabrication\ntechnologies. Current work-in-progress is focused\non automating the controlled mixing and deposition\nof polymer layers using a 6-axes robotic arm, as well\nas integrating the physical fabrication platform with\nuser design interfaces.\n8 CONTRIBUTIONS\nFunctionally Graded Rapid Prototyping (FGRP) is a\nnovel approach and method introducing the ability to\ndynamically mix and vary the ratios of component\nmaterials in complex 3-D distributions in order to\nproduce continuous gradients in a 3-D printed part.\nThis ability expands the potential of prototyping,\nsince the varying properties allows for optimization\nof material properties relative to their structural and\nfunctional performance and for more accurate\nevaluations of the intended final product, such as\nstress testing. FGRP could also contribute to efficient conservation of material usage, high performance of integrated structures, optimized response to\n\n9 FUTURE WORK\nFuture work will focus on developing the robotically\nautomated design fabrication platform to achieve\nnumerically controlled variable density and variable\nelasticity in product scales. In addition, the development of a 6-axes 3-D printing platform (in contrast to conventional 3-axes platforms) will offer opportunities to explore additional avenues of 3-D\nprinting such as automated embedded-part printing\nand integrating additional fabrication technologies\nwith 3-D printing (i.e. milling, painting, casting,\netc.). In parallel, continued exploration and development digital of form-generation environments will\nsupport the generation of 3-D forms incorporating\nmaterial properties and behavior with potentially\nreal-time fabrication feedback.\n10 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe Mediated Matter group at the MIT Media Lab\nwishes to thank our network of colleagues and advisers.
