Chicago has often been at the vanguard of innovation and style, and I commend the experts,\npanelists, architects, designers, and others gathered here for their commitment to forging a better future for ourselves\nand the world.\nWhile you are here, I hope that you will take time to discover all that makes Chicago a great place to live and visit. I know\nyou will like what you find. From our great architecture and beautiful Lake Michigan shoreline to our exciting nightlife,\nMillennium Park, and many world-renowned cultural institutions, Chicago offers something for everyone.\nBest wishes to everyone for an enjoyable and productive event.\nSincerely,\n\nMayor Richard M. Daley\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n11\n\nFOREWORD\n\nWellington Reiter\n\nPresident of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago\n\nWelcome to the ACADIA 09: reForm() conference—a unique forum for the examination of emerging research and\napplication of emerging technologies in today’s building and design professions. The School of the Art Institute\n(SAIC) is proudly hosting this conference as it is SAIC’s goal to remain at the center of the evolving discourse\nrelated to the built environment and the tools that will enable us to do this in a more effective, responsible, and\ndynamic manner.\nAt SAIC, the Departments of Visual Communications and Architecture, Interior Architecture, and Designed\nObjects (AIADO) encourage and practice a vibrant engagement with the world through design. We know that\nfuture practitioners will need to be entrepreneurial in their approach to their work and willing to redefine the\nquestions instead of simply responding to them. We encourage deep explorations in the studio context where\nthe art of thinking and making translate into the ineffable—at the very intersection of art, design, architecture, and\ntechnology. Above all, we take creativity and risk seriously as we launch leading voices that will transform the field\nfrom the inside out, while connecting past traditions with future possibilities.\nI am excited to see students, teachers, researchers, and design and construction professionals attend this\nrevolutionary conference as a first step in helping to build a better tomorrow. I owe a special thank you to\nboth Tristan d’Estrée Sterk, Assistant Professor of Architecture, for serving as ACADIA’s Technical Chair and\nDouglas Pancoast, Graduate Program Director and Associate Professor in AIADO, as ACADIA’s Onsite Chair.\nTheir dedication to presenting an unparalleled conference is deeply appreciated.\nEnjoy the conference and the city of Chicago and please take part in the numerous public programs that SAIC\nhas to offer.\nSincerely,\n\nWellington Reiter, FAIA\nPresident, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago\n\n12\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nFOREWORD\n\nMahesh Senagala\nPresident of ACADIA, 2009\n\nBurnham would have loved ACADIA.\nSwiss psychologist Carl Jung coined the word “synchronicity” to describe temporally coincident occurrences of events\nthat appear to have no causal relationship. I believe that it is synchronicity and not a coincidence that the ACADIA\n2009 conference is taking place among the myriad festivities of the Burnham Plan Centennial, which celebrates the\n“bold plans and big dreams” behind the shaping of metropolitan Chicago in honor of Daniel Burnham. Nestled amid\nremarkable architectural works of our times, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago sets a splendid stage for a stirring\ndiscourse on the emerging topics in computing in architecture and related fields.\nACADIA has always been a refuge, a platform, a stage, and a community for radical and innovative thinkers whose work\nis on the razor-sharp edge of emerging design computation technologies and strategies. Our association consistently\nattracts internationally distributed authors and participants from all continents—evidence that ACADIA provides a rare\nand necessary forum for high-quality, relevant, and bleeding-edge discourses. This year, out of 105 paper submissions\nfrom 18 countries representing all continents, 37 papers were chosen (a 35 percent acceptance rate) for presentation\nand publication, which further solidifies ACADIA as a leader in promoting and showcasing cutting-edge work in the field.\nIt is heartening to see the overwhelming response to the timely theme and challenge set forth by the conference chairs.\nThese papers address complex, sophisticated, and provocative topics that dwell on the potent nexus of computation,\ncollaboration, design, geometry, biomimicry, materiality, making, pedagogy, interactivity, and the staggering challenges\nof our times. In these papers, I have no doubt, are the black swans of innovation that will bring about radical change in\nour field.

We are here to share ideas and to\nspeculate about what the world might look like if it were challenged, rethought, and rebuilt. We are here to uncover, piece\nby piece, a sense of our own ambitions for an architecture influenced by today but motivated by tomorrow.\nWe are all speculators and dreamers. We find places for dreaming in our work, our models, our essays, our lectures, our\nresearch, and our teaching. Through these activities we speculate on the architecture of tomorrow. Sometimes these\nspeculations hold great promise, while at other times they do not – certainly much of what we do can be improved, refined,\nqualified, quantified, and genuinely benefit from being computed. This could be horrifying; it could set the scene for an\nengineered architecture if we do not adapt.\nBut architecture is changing and responding to very fresh and different ways of thinking. As a movement, young architects\nare questioning their inheritance and establishing new values, new methods, and new forms of practice. We might\nbest think of these young architects as the Generation X of architecture – a generation who shapes discourse through\ntechnological, social, and environmental lenses. From its smallest technical process to its highest level of thought, this\nconference represents the spirit of this movement.\n\nThe Upbringing of Gen X: Nurture not Nature\nGenerations of architects do not grow from thin air. They take time to establish themselves, and as they mature, each\ngeneration experiences many different forms of practice. This is true for every generation of architects, but it might be even\ntruer for Gen X.1\nOver the past twenty years, change has ripped through the profession of architecture at an incredible rate, giving rise to a\nplethora of micro-movements that form a continuous line of thought from the late eighties through to today. Architecture’s\nGen X is unique in that it has witnessed each of these changes and, in many ways, adopted them as a collective\n\n18\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nI­ntroduction: Thoughts for Gen X—Speculating about\nthe Rise of Continuous Measurement in Architecture\nheritage. A case of nurture rather than nature gives this generation of architects a perspective like no other. But what is this\nperspective and how might we make sense of it?\nThe history of Generation X really begins in the late eighties when the seemingly all-encompassing grasp of postmodern\narchitecture began to exhaust its fuel and turn to examinations of material, form, and structure. As a form of postmodern practice, deconstructivism emerged to investigate rhetorical forays into truth, unity and humanist construction\nin architecture.2 Transforming the discipline, the deconstructivists arrived at what can only be described as the polar\nopposite to architectural convention. Evading conventional notions of building, their work established architecture as a\nchaotic, perhaps nihilistic, and fragmented practice. Without urgency for order or restriction, the works that resulted sought\nto be no more than ‘building’. To achieve this was a challenge. Peter Eisenman’s early thinking led the discipline to believe\nthat architecture should aim to upset conventional design methodologies and aesthetic outcomes by dislocating buildings\nfrom everyday expectations. Like Eisenman, Lebbeus Woods spent time producing several works of that dislocated\narchitecture from its ‘known’ environment.3 As an intellectual position, this was revolutionary and critical to the development\nof new discourse.4 But the necessity of this architecture was short-lived.\nAs deconstructivism fell new forms of practice came forward to fill its void. Not immune to postmodern discourse, these\nnew architectures absorbed selective chunks of deconstructivism.5 Part of this process involved debate from the related\narts of video and new media, which drew architectural thinking into concerns of the body and its adaptive capabilities.\nCyber-bodies, virtual space, and the televisual became important features of this new architecture.6\nVirtual and digital architectures, unencumbered by gravity, material connections, and time, opened the door to early Gen X\ninvestigations. Cheap and limitless exploration in networked social spaces that had no history or expected norm provided\nthe ideal forum.7 The works that resulted often emphasized what architects could not effectively or easily achieve in the\nreal world. Merging still further with notions of body, STELARC’s ideas became known to architects, giving rise to the\narchitectural hybridization of the human body. Architects could now directly realize that the spaces they were designing\nno longer needed to be detached from the body. Space could detect and adapt to people.8 The brightest genius of this\nmovement is found in the work of Marcos Novak. At its peek, his work inspired a class of remarkable, temporary digital\nforms to emerge.\nMarcos Novak’s most famous work was carried out in the mid- to late nineties in the area of practice known as liquid\narchitecture. He described it in 1995 in the following way: “If we described liquid architecture as a symphony in space,\nthis description should still fall short of the promise. A symphony, though it varies within its duration, is still a fixed object\nand can be repeated. At its fullest expression, a liquid architecture is more than that. It is a symphony of space, but a\nsymphony that never repeats and continues to develop. If architecture is an extension of our bodies, shelter and actor for\nthe fragile self, a liquid architecture is that self in the act of becoming its own changing shelter. Like us, it has an identity;\nbut this identity is only revealed fully during the course of\nits lifetime.”9 These virtual architectures adopt much of the\ncybernetic; they configure and adjust to our actions, our\ngestures, and our presence. As a field of practice, Marcos’\nwork introduced the discourse to extremely sophisticated\nnotions of event, interaction, and customization – making\neach central to the production of architecture. Though this\nwork was marked by the distinct aesthetic overtones of\ndeconstructivism its intellectual core was very different. His\nwork let Gen X develop, liberate, and question everything\nthat they had known about architecture.\n\nFigure 1 Lebbeus\nWoods, SCAB\nConstruction 1993\n\nHowever, architects were not the only people exploring this\nturf. While Gen X watched Novak blaze trails into the use\nof interaction in architecture, computer scientists worked\nindependently to lay claim to similar ground. Using very\ndifferent tools, computer scientists placed microcontrollers,\nsensors, and actuators into the fabric of the built world with\nthe desire to produce new types of controllable systems.\nThe pinnacle of this work was Bill Gates’ famous mansion.10 This intelligent building made headline news in 1997 when it\nwas reported that the house used microcontrollers and simple network technologies to produce spaces that could track\nusers and adjust its character to suit. Interactive systems were spreading and computing was becoming physical via\ncheap, reliable sensors.\nThough concurrent for the most part, the ultimate successor to Novak’s liquid architecture was Greg Lynn and the animate\nform movement. Lynn’s work11 fell in lockstep with Novak, adopting much of the larger ambition for architecture that liquid\narchitectures had sought. “Animation is a term that differs from, but is often confused with, motion. While motion implies\nmovement and action, animation implies the evolution of a form and its shaping forces; it suggests animalism, animism,\ngrowth, actuation, vitality and virtuality.”12 Lynn built upon this common foundation, extending the work to tackle the\nproduction of architecture in a much more direct way. In doing so, he adopted new methodologies and tools while refining\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n19\n\nI­ntroduction: Thoughts for Gen X—Speculating about\nthe Rise of Continuous Measurement in Architecture\nand repositioning the aesthetic from one of fracture to one of smoothness. By making this exchange, he resolved many\nbut not all of the practical problems architects face during construction. Intellectually, his work gave digital architecture the\nlanguage of dynamics, fields, and forces.\nNovak, and Lynn each used time in a different capacity to determine the role it could play in architecture, challenging the\ntheoretical and methodological frameworks of the discipline. Both found a place for using events and forces as structures\nto organize space and generate form – even if these forces and events were never rationally quantified. As each of their\nfields matured, both contributed to the advancement of digital architecture and its ability to incorporate more realizable and\nrefined notions of scripting, choreography, and emergence.\nThe baton pass of concepts from deconstructivism’s adoption of no measure, to virtual architecture’s explorations of form\nas a dynamic measure of body and event, to the animate exploration of time in relation to surface, forms a key sequence.\nWhile observing these developments and their gradual deepening within architectural thinking, a young generation of\narchitects learned the tools of their new trade. For this generation, computation and design were the same thing.\n\nFor a moment, we must pause and be cautiously critical. This still young movement has not yet matured its discourse to\nthe level of outright theory. Undoubtedly, these words will be received sensitively, but it should be realized that much of\nwhat we have been reading over the past several years, even within the work of Lynn, is method, not theory. Today, method\noften rests in the guise of theory, which is problematic because methods themselves do not produce movements – a point\nthat might account for some of the recent schism between thinking and making, and the perceived “thoughtlessness” of\ntechnology in architecture. This emerging movement is not thoughtless, but neither is it as thoughtful as it could be. It is a\nyoung movement and its practitioners are still finding their legs.\nSo we ask, what is to come. Is something deeper and more significant happening to our profession, or are we just looking\nat a change in methods and tools? Is this new architecture more than method, and what might its approach imply about\nthe aspirations and dreams of Gen X?\n\nFigure 2 Marcos\nNovak, trans\nTerraFerma/\nTidsvagNoll v2.0,\n1995\nFigure 3 Greg Lynn,\nStereolithography\nmodel, House\nPrototype in Long\nIsland, 1999\n\nMeasurement is not X’s Measure\nIf one concept can bind all of architecture it must be measurement. Measurement holds just the right degree of symbolic\nvalue and technical wit for nexuses between theories and methods to form. Throughout history, measurement has been\nthe primary method used by architects to conceive, describe, develop, and control their work. It is crucial.\nOr is it? If one concept defines the emergence of Generation X’s architecture, it is a change in the nature and role\nof measurement. Through a sequence of movements, architecture has reared away from the measure of modernism,\nthrough the wilderness of fragmentation, and toward a rationale of event and time. Measurement, its use, role, and visibility,\nhas changed dramatically at both intellectual and technical levels. So how does Gen X see measurement?\nConventionally, architects have used measurement for the production of architectural form, but as a tool used for this\npurpose, it no longer exists in the work of Gen X. Rather, form is produced intuitively and with great fluidity.13 It is cast,\npulled, stretched, and twisted by parametric processes as though it were toffee at a country fair. The architecture that these\nprocesses craft will still fill a site, they will still contain interiors, condition them and provide shelter, and at points through these\nprocesses, calculations will be done to find the usable area of a building – but that is about it. For Gen X, measurement is\nfound on the reverse side of the equation, within the analysis of form rather than in form itself. For the most cunning of Gen\nX, the bleeding edge of this process rests in developing automated loops that tie analysis directly to form.14 Here, analytical\nprocesses, not the architect, provide form with its measure. Though this sounds new, it is not; it is a direct relative of Lynn\nand Novak’s work from nearly ten years ago.\nIf we step back to look at the discipline of architecture as a whole, it is clear that architecture has made a series of major\nmoves. It has moved away from frozen form and toward dynamic form. It has shifted away from discrete measurement, to\n\n20\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nI­ntroduction: Thoughts for Gen X—Speculating about\nthe Rise of Continuous Measurement in Architecture\nFigure 4 SOM Black\nBox Studio, Analysis\ninforming form in a\nroof canopy, 2009\n\nmore fluid, parameterized notions of form. It has moved\naway from single processes to iterative systems and\nautomation. It has also come to accept analysis as\nthe primary means by which measurements are made\nand successes or failures are found.15 Furthermore,\nthis new generation is quickly adopting analysis as a\nmeans to drive everything from structural decisions\nto those that affect lighting, acoustics, and thermal\ncomfort. In this newfound capacity, the production\nof automated form is likely to become the hallmark of\nGen X’s work. So this is what has been happening:\nGeneration X has been slowly increasing its use\nof computation, in lieu of measurement, to take\nadvantage of convenient analytical techniques that are\nused produce an informed architecture.\n\nThe Future of Measurement Is Continuous Measurement\nWe are not really at this conference to deliberate what is known but, rather, to turn our attention to the unknown. If the\npower of computers to calculate quickly and accurately has dramatically changed the role of measurement in architecture,\naltering the nature of our work, then we might ask how to best envision the future.\nThere might be no more radical idea for our discipline than that of employing continuous measurement to produce works\nof architecture that can change autonomously. These works will bind measurement (in the form of analysis) directly into the\nfabric of our buildings. Such buildings will challenge not just the design methods we use, but also the very concept of what\na building can be. In effect, this move translates building systems into robotic architectural media.16\nAbout ten years ago, I began working in the field of robotics\nin architecture with the goal of producing a new class\nof buildings that echoed the work of Novak and Lynn.\nBuilding upon Novak’s idea of event-based architectures\nand Lynn’s idea of animate form, I concluded that the only\nlogical step forward was for architecture to incorporate\nanalysis directly into the fabric of a building, rather than into\nthe models that we use to describe buildings.17\nThis work took shape via a series of early structural\nexperiments that incorporated computational devices\ndirectly into built fabric. Each prototype was capable of\ncontinuously analyzing and measuring their geometry with\nthe goal of correcting and changing their shape. Using\nembedded control devices, with sensors and actuators,\neach structure directly responded to the forces that acted\nupon them. A new class of structures emerged from this\nwork to provide an early demonstration of the promise that\ncontinuous measurement holds for our discipline.18 As an\nidea continuous measurement has the potential to bring\nmajor change.\n\nConclusion\n\nFigure 5 Tristan\nd’Estrée Sterk,\nideaCloud:\nExperimental dance\ntheatre for Grange\nBeach, 1998\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nRecently, there has been a somewhat hidden, tenuous\nrelationship between parametric architecture, and\nmodernism. We often recognize this as a conflict\nbetween mass production (industrialization) and mass\ncustomization (parameterization), but more subtly and\nimportantly, the heart of this conflict can be found in the\ndifferences between the beliefs we hold for space and the\ntechnologies we use to produce it. It is a question of holding universal aspiration or being locally content.19 Continuing from\nthis we can understand digital tools, and by extension the architectures they produce, in one of two ways. In the modern\nsense as works that are built in and ascribe to universal space, or alternatively as works that support highly contextualized\nnotions of real space.\nThe incorporation of continuous measurement and the affect it will have on modulating and adapting architectural form\nmight provide a way for us to bridge this divide. It might enable us to build simple models that can be applied universally but\nadapted extremely quickly and accurately to suit real space. Parametric design should be capable of making these ideas\n\n21\n\nI­ntroduction: Thoughts for Gen X—Speculating about\nthe Rise of Continuous Measurement in Architecture\ntangible but this will only happen when the parameters we use are allowed to creep into the very fabric of our buildings. I\nam delighted to report that much of the work shown at this conference represents several first steps made by this younger\ngeneration of architects – first steps towards achieving a vision for the architecture of tomorrow.\n\nEndnotes\n1\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n\n15\n16\n17\n18\n\n19\n\n22\n\nDOUGLAS COUPLAND FIRST DESCRIBED THE NATURE OF GENERATION X IN 1989 IN A SHORT, ILLUSTRATED ARTICLE IN A TORONTO\nBASED BUSINESS MAGAZINE CALLED VISTA.

This discourse has become a vibrant hub for fostering transdisciplinary, provocative works in the architectural enterprise. At ACADIA 09: reForm(), the exhibition Calculation\nand Substance will foreground the works of four design practices that use a variety of context-specific hardware\nand software in the definition of design problems and the proposition of projects.\nWorks from Architecture and Vision, BlackBox Studio, Thom Faulders Studio, and Travis Saul cast architectural\nenvironments as an assembly of objects and processes that create relationships between buildings, people,\nand contexts. Prototypes of full-scope projects are presented “full-scale,” meaning they produce for the visitor a\nreal-time and real-place experience. The exhibition reveals how current artists and designers, in order to reform\nand improve the built environment, are inventing and applying a new “middleware,” that is, buildings consisting of\nsituational software and/or hardware systems.\nThis middleware interacts with a variety of sites and site conditions and points to ideas of human settlement more\nthoroughly and beneficially integrated into the complexity of some enveloping domain.\nSpeaking of integration, the timing of ACADIA 09: reForm() poses a rare opportunity to connect its events with\nLearning Modern, an exhibition (and series of programs) concurrent with the ACADIA conference in which Calculation\nand Substance is symbiotically installed. Conceived to celebrate Modernism and probe the presence of Bauhaus\nconcepts still at play in our world, the Learning Modern program foregrounds the history of modern speculations\nand examines two enduring points of Bauhaus pedagogy: (1) work produced in innovative interdisciplinary and\nmulti-technological ways; and (2) work with the intent to make a better world.\n\n24\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nKEYNOTES\n\nDigital Technologies,\nMethods, and Tools in\nSupport of the Architectural\nDevelopment at Herzog &\nde Meuron\nKai Strehlke\n\nHead of Design Technology, Herzog & de Meuron\n\nIntroduction\nThe architectural office of Herzog & de Meuron (HdM) started in 1978 and has grown, today, to a company of about 330\nemployees, with site offices in Madrid, Hamburg, London, and New York. Besides the two founding partners who participate\nin every project there are nine additional partners who take responsibility for individual projects. Project team members are hired\nfrom among highly qualified graduates of universities from all over the world. Furthermore, the office collaborates with artists and\noutside experts of various fields to support and enhance the available knowledge and skills. Today, buildings are being developed\nin Europe, North and South America, and Asia. The partners ensure that each project has a distinct and unique identity and is\nwell adapted to its environment. This emphasis on the uniqueness of a project characterizes the design philosophy of HdM.\nThe growth of the office and the size and complexity of the projects has demanded continuous adaptation of the office structure.\nThe amount of required data is increasing exponentially, while the design cycles are, generally, becoming shorter. There are\nindividual design teams for each project, but their size is restricted. They have a top-down hierarchy and develop the project in\na fairly traditional manner. Within the teams, individuality is fostered and supported. The design process is very fast. There are\nmany design cycles and, therefore, many drawings, models, and prototypes to be made.\n\nAnalog and Digital Tools Used in the Architectural\nAt the beginning of a project, there is a strong conceptual architectural idea. The architectural process consists of developing\nthis design concept and turning it into a workable architectural plan. The challenge is to find the right tools and media. HdM does\nnot restrict itself to the realm of digital tools but, rather, uses all possible media: hand sketches in pencil, together with diagrams,\ndrawings, and images, as well as physical and digital models. The media is used to translate the idea, not to create it. This raises\nthe issue on how digital tools are being used in this context.\nThere has been a lot of talk about BIM (Building Information Modeling software). BIM is a digital approach that goes far beyond\ntraditional CAD software by representing the project in the form of a database rather than pure geometry. BIM may be an\nexcellent tool for firms that use standardized architecture. In our office, it is applied for specific projects that are ideally represented\nby a consistent database. However, it is not the right tool for all our projects: First, a lot of young architects are still not familiar with\nthe underlying principles of BIM modeling and find it much more intuitive to work with pure vector geometry. Second, very often\nwe do not have a unique, consistent model of the project, because different sub-teams are working on confined themes of the\nproject, developing multiple parallel solutions. It is not easy to consolidate these solutions within a consistent model. Third, the\nuniqueness of each project makes it difficult to apply a BIM model. We have been working with BIM software and are continuing\nto use it, but not always with success.\nA suite of generic CAD and graphic software tools is used in the office to develop the architectural design. These tools are used\nfor image manipulation, diagrams, traditional architectural CAD drawings, 3D modeling, and renderings. Using standard tools\nallows for a very simple exchange between team members—an important issue at a time when project flow is often interrupted\nby economic conditions. The use of software should support the knowledge of the user, not replace it. If the user does not\nunderstand the basic principles of the geometry that he is using, then his ability to manage the component construction of the\nresulting project is compromised. For specific complex geometric tasks in-house generated software tools are being developed\nto support the architects.\n\n26\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nDigital Technologies, Methods, and Tools in Support of\nthe Architectural Development at Herzog & de Meuron\nPhysical models are a key component of the development process for the design team. In the office, a CAD drawing is not\nused as the sole document. Physical models are used in the first design stages to develop and verify the design intent.\nModels are made in all scales and sizes. Concept models as well as mock-ups are very important for the design cycles\nand are built throughout the whole design process. As such, a fully equipped analog workshop with excellent model\nmakers exists in the office. To support and expand the analog workshop, a digital workshop has been built in the office\nthat implements every existing and new technology—a strategy similar to that used in choosing our software. Our in-house\nmachine park consists of three generic CNC-machines: a large, size 3-achses milling machine, a laser-cutting system,\nand a cutting plotter. The advantage of these three machines is that they can easily be incorporated into the analog model\nmaking, and the production processes are fast and simple enough to be managed by the design architects in the office.\nRapid prototyping models are outsourced; we have only a critical approach to produce them in house. Rapid prototyping\nis not very flexible, and the machines needed are not generic. They have specific input requirements and give specific\noutput results. They are not as helpful to the design development as the three machines in the digital workshop. The result\nis often uninformative for anything besides visualization of geometry. Additionally, the models are difficult to incorporate into\nthe traditional workshop. They are flat and monolithic and do not provide many insights into the component construction\nor subdivision of the project. We use this technology as a final output mechanism for presentation models. Another\nadvantage of outsourcing these models is that this technology is still new, with new products regularly coming on the\nmarket. By outsourcing, we always have access to the latest available technology.\n\nThe Digital Technology Group\nTo be able to manage all the unique and different conceptual design approaches, a small digital technologies group\nhas been created inside the office to provide support and create tools that allow projects to move forward. The group\ncan be integrated into the design teams and is intended to enhance and support the creative abilities of the office as a\nwhole. The group serves to facilitate architecture, not create it, and is able to deal with complex geometries in a flexible\nand adaptive manner.\nThe process of developing digital tools for design is one of developing programmed strategies that are focused to a\nspecific idea defined by the design task. Typically it is about minimizing the driving input for the project while keeping the\noutput parametric adaptable enough to all the different cases. Parametric tools must be created appropriately so as to\nensure that the process can deliver the requirements of the design team. The main tasks consist in finding an abstraction\nof the design idea in order to map the idea into a digital data structure, and creating an efficient algorithm to process\nthe data. There are cases where the numbers of exceptions within the design are so numerous that the whole project\nbecomes a set of unique situations. At this point, the design team can either refocus the project to accept a more generic\nand flexible solution or move the design back to handwork or to the partner for clarification.\nSpeed is a critical issue in the design cycle. The technology group needs to work at the same speed as the design\nteam. If one cannot move at the same speed as those working by hand, then the project will move away from the CAD\ngroup. Often it is the opposite: The only way to maintain speed is to involve the group so that design cycles can move\nfast enough.\n\nDigital Chain\nThe term “digital chain” represents the complete digital process from initial design to building completion. In the academic\nworld, the digital chain has been realized in a number of small projects. At Herzog & de Meuron, the size and geometric\ncomplexity of projects make it very difficult or impossible to map the entire project process in a digital chain. Our strategy\nis to extract a specific design component and map this on a digital chain. However, this chain needs to be kept flexible.\nThere are always moments when the architect breaks the chain by integrating a new manual input. An important task of\nour group is to integrate this input into the digital chain. When we realize a complete digital chain, the design data can be\nautomatically transformed onto the production processes.\nMore than five hundred years ago, Leon Battista Alberti differentiated the intellectual act of designing from the act of\nconstruction in his book, De Re Aedificatoria; this separation is still in practice in architectural production today. In general,\nthe architect hands his design to a construction company. From the architectural plan, the construction company develops\na working drawing. The architect takes responsibility for the design; the construction company, for the construction. The\ncomplexity of some of today’s architecture makes this process expensive and inefficient. The digital chain overcomes this\nseparation. This is a very new reality in architecture and has yet to be evaluated from the viewpoint of liability and risks.\n\nProjects\nOut of the variety of projects the digital technology group is involved in, the following projects demonstrate the span of\nits activities.\n\nThe City of Flamenco in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain (2003)\nThe City of Flamenco is a cultural complex that includes an auditorium, a museum, a school, and a documentation\ncenter. The Ciudad del Flamenco is situated in the center of Jerez de la Frontera, a Spanish city with a rich Moorish past.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n27\n\nDigital Technologies, Methods, and Tools in Support of\nthe Architectural Development at Herzog & de Meuron\nThe project consists of a partially perforated wall, following the historical lines of the city. A tower rises above this wall; its\nscale recalls the two towers of the Alcazar, and it also takes up an urban dialogue with the nearby cathedral. The materiality\nof the project is reduced to the traditional, homogeneous use of stone that characterizes the old town. The perforated wall\nitself, as well as the interior of the garden, forms a topography out of extruded, sunken and projecting bodies, generating\na rich interplay between outside and inside spaces. The Ciudad del Flamenco is a radically contemporary and dynamic\nplatform for performers and audiences.\nThe surfaces of the Ciudad del Flamenco consist of poured, perforated, and artificially processed concrete; they follow the\nlines, shapes, and patterns of Gypsy tradition and Arabic ornamentation. Both traditions are extremely contemporary; to\nbe more precise, they are a centuries-old and ceaseless new source of inspiration for contemporary art and daily culture.\nWe encounter them in punk and rock music, in tattoos, in symbols and emblems, in patterns, and in many other places.\nThis kind of ornamentation informs the concrete material used at the Ciudad del Flamenco.\nA collection of digitally generated tags were developed to create the ornament. From the tags, a perforated wall was\ndesigned, surrounding and supporting a tower and part of the enclosure of the building project. For the placement and\nthe composition of the tags, a program was written. The ornament was to be made from concrete with openings resulting\nfrom the shape of the tags. The façade had to fulfill a variation of different functions, which defined the parameters of the\nprogrammed ornament.\nOf primary importance was the consideration of static requirements. The weight of the building had to be carried by the\nornament. For this reason, points were defined through which the loads of the slabs were conducted into the façade.\nSpecial tags were designed and precisely placed in the façade to fulfill this function. Another requirement was to leave\nseveral bigger openings to enable access for fire brigades in case of fire. Furthermore, the tags had to serve as sunshade,\ndepending on the position of the walls. This again called for specific adaptations of the tags.\nTo develop the multifunctional ornament, a large number of processes were programmed that, step by step, led to the\ndesired result. Some functions had to be met with a high degree of precision, others allowed for some scope of tolerance.\nTo keep a high level of flexibility and allow, at the same time, high complexity in the design, different types of data were\nused to parameterize the façade. Parameters that needed a high geometric precision were retrieved from geometric input\nfiles; the other parameters were stored in pixel-based image files.\nThe ornament was developed in a continuous digital chain that could be interrupted at any time, and carried further by\ntraditional methods. To enable the construction of the building, it was important to employ this approach. The final design\nexists as a conventional drawing and, likewise, as a model of digital data that can be used for the construction of the\nfacade with CNC-controlled machines. Furthermore, the digital model allows for adaptations of the design and production\nof the ornament throughout the whole building process.\n\nElbphilharmonie in Hamburg, Germany (2003)\nThe Elbphilharmonie is a cultural complex being built in the harbor of Hamburg. The design incorporates two distinct\nelements: a pre-existing brick warehouse and a new, crystalline tentlike structure that seems to float above the industrial\nbase. A public plaza on top of the warehouse, high above the river Elbe, separates the two elements. It is a highly\ncomplex project, not only for its geometry, but also for the building program, which contains two concert halls, a hotel,\nand residential apartments.\n\n28\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nDigital Technologies, Methods, and Tools in Support of\nthe Architectural Development at Herzog & de Meuron\nTwo elements of the project have been developed using a parametric scripting approach. For the concert hall, a tool to\nparameterize a sound diffusive surface pattern for the interior of the symphonic concert hall has been developed. Out of\nthe acoustical requirements, the architectural intention, and the production process, a highly flexible design has been\ncreated for this specific task.\nA second parametric approach has been undertaken for the design of the frit pattern of the glass façade. The glass\nfaçade, consisting, in part, of curved panels (some of them cut open), becomes a gigantic, iridescent crystal that\ncatches the changing reflections of the sky, water, and harbor. In total, there are about 2,200 glass elements with a\nhigh variety of different sizes. To reduce solar gains, about 30 percent of the glass surface of each space behind the\nfaçade had to be printed.\n\nBird’s Nest Lamp (2009)\nThe national stadium for the Olympic Games in Beijing, 2008, generally known as the “Bird’s Nest,” has attracted worldwide\nattention as a Chinese icon. A special lamp had been designed that was produced in China using traditional construction\nmethods. This lamp will now be produced in Europe. It has been found desirable to parametrize the new model, as the\nexact parameters of its production are not known. The same geometrical principle as the one for the “Bird’s Nest” will\nbe used in the design of the lamp. Ribs should run over double-bent surfaces and meet in defined knots. Modeling\nthis geometry directly is difficult to achieve. It is much easier to define the parameters in the 2D space and apply a\ntransformation of them into the 3D space. This cannot be achieved with regular 3D modeling software, as a sphere cannot\nbe unfolded in a plane. During this process, the points of the globe are defined in analogy to the degrees of latitude and\nlongitude of the earth. Hereby, the distances can be stretched and the points can be exactly transferred from the circle on\nthe globe. Therefore, the task is reduced by drawing the axels of the ribs on a circular surface. The knots of the existing\nlamp, thus, can simply be taken from the original model.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n29\n\nTools of Expression:\nNotation and Interaction\nfor Design Computation\n\nRobert Aish\n\nDirector of Software Development, Autodesk\n\nDesign considers function, fabrication, and aesthetics collectively. Computation is beginning to affect the competitive\ndynamics of design. Using algorithms, designers are exploring forms that are essentially “undrawable,” even with\nadvanced modeling and direct manipulation techniques. Determining the appropriate functional characteristics may\nrequire the application of increasingly complex structural- and environmental-performance analysis techniques.\nTo realize physically a design may require further geometric analysis and rationalization, and the use of complex\ncomputer-controlled fabrication techniques.\nDesign and Computation are converging, whether this is in the use of computational techniques to realize conventionally\ndrawn or modeled configurations or to generate the original form or configuration. In fact, the fundamental basis for\nDesign Computation is the recognition that algorithms are an expressive medium of design: algorithms are not just\nthe prerogative of computer scientists; designers with computational skills can develop them, and these algorithms\ncan play a critical role in the design of buildings and other artifacts. The implications are:\n• Design Computation allows the creation of geometric forms and configurations that would be difficult, if not\nimpossible, to conventionally draw or model by hand with interactive graphical manipulation.\n• Changes to the driving parameters or to the underlying algorithm allow for the rapid exploration of alternative forms\nand configurations (again with greater ease than with conventional design methods).\n• Combining generative and evaluative computational techniques enables a process of “form finding,” in which the\ndesign’s function, fabrication, and aesthetic characteristics can be synthesized (in ways previously unachievable).\nDesign Computation suggests a different approach to design. The designer need no longer focus on designing a\nspecific artifact (or configuration), but rather, he has the opportunity to externalize the underlying “design logic” and\nuse this to explore a whole range of alternative solutions. Design Computation also suggests a different approach to\nthe development of software applications. Instead of presenting a completely comprehensive “view” of the design\ndomain, the design application effectively becomes a platform that presents a more general abstraction of geometry\nand composition. The designer (with computational skills) uses this platform to create the final, customized layer of\napplication logic, specific to the design problem at hand.\nEssentially, with Design Computation, the designer is moving from “doing” (directly designing) to “controlling” (defining\nthe algorithm and the parameters with which the design or range of designs will be generated), and the role of the\nprogrammer is being blurred between the professional software developer and the designer as “end-user programmer.”\nAs the title of this paper suggests, our focus is to develop “tools of expression” for designers. This involves creating an\nappropriate “notation for design logic” (in the sense of an end-user programming language), as well as “instruments”\nthat can present the expressive possibilities of this notation to a creative audience of designers (in the sense of\ninteractive applications). These applications should not only be able to be “played” intuitively, but also support and\nrespond to “compositions” that are more complex. In addition, these applications should be capable of progressively\n\n30\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nTools of Expression: Notation and Interaction for Design\nComputation\nrevealing the potential of the underlying notation and allow for the expression of design that is more consciously\nconsidered. The notation and related interactive applications present a unique opportunity to understand and support\nthe diversity of design, which spans, potentially, from the improvised to the contrived.\nThe essential challenge here is to understand the learning curve that might enable designers without formal\ncomputational training to explore progressively the new possibilities that Design Computation has to offer. However,\nto be successful, the designer must be willing to free himself from established design patterns and rebuild his design\nknowledge based on a fundamental understanding of geometric and logical abstraction.\nThere is no imperative that suggests that Design Computation is “inevitable” or “has to be adopted.” It is an option,\na possibility, for those creative designers for whom geometry and logic are the essential foundations of design, and\nwho enjoy moving effortlessly between the abstract and the practical and understand the potential of computation\nas an expressive medium of design.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n31\n\nWhat Inspires Them:\nScience Fiction’s Impact\non Science Reality\n\nPeter W.

You never know whether or not it will come true.”\n—Donna Shirley 1\nThe Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame appropriately stands in the shadow of Seattle’s futuristic landmark,\nthe Space Needle. Set in a multicolored, globular Frank Gehry–designed building that looks like a cut-up guitar (a\n“ridiculous...monstrosity of postmodern architecture” is another writer’s take), it shares the space with the Experience\nMusic Project, a museum for rock and roll music. The odd juxtaposition of the two museums is actually quite simple:\nscience fiction and Jimi Hendrix music were the two boyhood loves of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who is the\nprimary funder of both.\nFounded in 2004, the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame is dedicated to exploring science fiction, both its\nhistory and how it shapes our culture, politics, and philosophy. While the Experience Music Project next door has the\nguitars used by Bob Dylan, Bo Diddley, and Kurt Cobain, the Science Fiction Museum rocks just as hard. Artifacts on\ndisplay in the museum include Captain Kirk’s command chair from Star Trek, the alien queen from Aliens, Darth Vader’s\nhelmet from The Empire Strikes Back, Neal Stephenson’s handwritten manuscript for the Baroque Cycle trilogy, and the\npistol used by Harrison Ford in Blade Runner. The Museum also runs a kids program, including a “summer camp on\nMars,” as well as a happy hour for the adults, with $3 beers on tap.\nIt is easy to think of the Museum and Hall of Fame as some sort of “Pantheon of Nerds,” as my editor jokingly called it,\nfor science fiction may well be the ultimate of geekdom. Perhaps no one puts it better than social commentator Chuck\nKlosterman, who once wrote that admitting you like science fiction is “like admitting you masturbate twice a day, or that\nyour favorite band was They Might Be Giants.”2\nYet, science fiction is undeniably popular. The earliest science fiction was by storied writers such as Mary Shelley,\nwhose Frankenstein was first published in 1818, and Nathaniel Hawthorne, whose story “The Birthmark” wrestled with\nplastic surgery before plastic was even invented. Today, roughly 10 percent of all books are in the science fiction and\n\n32\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nWhat Inspires Them: Science Fiction’s Impact on\nScience Reality\nfantasy genre. This does not even count major authors like Michael Crichton or Tom Clancy, who write “techno-thrillers,”\nwhich are science fiction in all but name.\nScience fiction has thrived even more in modern media forms. Six of the top ten grossing movies of all time are science\nfiction, led by the original Star Wars (inexplicably still behind Titanic in total sales). On TV, many of the most popular and\ninfluential shows of all time, from The Twilight Zone to Lost, have been science fiction. An entire cable network, the Sci\nFi Channel, is exclusively devoted to the genre. For having programming on such a geeky topic, the network is doing\nquite well, ranking in the top ten on basic cable.\nScience fiction is more than just popular; it is also incredibly influential, to an extent that is often surprising. Time and\nagain, science fiction makes its presence felt on real world technology, war, and politics. At iRobot, for example, the\nrobotics research group described how their team motto was a toss-up between “making science fiction reality” and\n“practical science fiction” (they could not yet decide which they liked better). Science fiction references and ideas also\nmake frequent appearances on the military side as well, coming up in almost any meeting on new military technologies\nor on how to use them. Even Admiral Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (that is, the man in charge of\nthe entire U.S. military), proudly described how the Navy’s “Professional Reading” program, which he helped develop\nto guide his sailors in their careers, includes the science fiction novels Starship Troopers and Ender’s Game.\n\nWhat is Science Fiction?\nDonna Shirley, director of the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame, is perhaps the best person in the world to\nexplain what science fiction is. Shirley recalls that as a kid growing up in Wynnewood, Oklahoma, she was “always\ninterested in airplanes.” At the age of ten, she went to her uncle’s college graduation. In the commencement program,\nthere was a listing for graduates with aeronautical engineering degrees. Shirley remembers asking her mother what that\nmeant. “My mother replied, ‘Those are the people who make airplanes.’ And so that’s what I wanted to be.”\nAt the age of sixteen, Donna Shirley got her pilot’s license. She then enrolled at the University of Oklahoma (she was\nthe only woman in her classes) and earned that degree her mother had told her about. “Although the guys in my\nclasses were fine with me being an engineer, my college advisor for aeronautical engineering told me girls couldn’t be\nengineers,” she recalls.\nIn 1966, Shirley joined NASA’s prestigious Jet Propulsion Lab; she was one of the space program’s first female\nengineers. Over the next thirty-two years, she worked on a variety of projects, from automating controls of military\nsatellites to working on the Mariner space probe’s ten trips to Venus and Mercury. She capped her career by serving\nas manager of the Mars Exploration Program, which included the 1997 Mars Pathfinder and the Sojourner robotic rover\nmissions. As one article describes, “Not only were these events two of the U.S. space program’s greatest successes,\nbut they may well provide the world with some of the most important scientific data of the 20th and 21st centuries.” 3\nShirley credits the science fiction she read growing up as key factor in her career. She recalls reading the stories of\nRobert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov when she was eleven. “The political issues in the books went over my head,” she tells,\n“but their heroes were always engineers and scientists...Heinlein and Asimov also frequently had women characters\nas heroes, which resonated with me.” During the publicity surrounding NASA’s Mars missions, the organizers of the\nScience Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame heard Shirley talking about science fiction’s influence on her work and invited\nher to join the team.\nShe sees her role and that of the Museum to “educate people about science fiction and to make people realize how\nimportant it is in our culture, and by implication get them interested in science and the social aspects of science. At the\nsame time, we can pass on some moral lessons...In a sense, it’s to capture their imagination away from, say, Playboy\nand into something a bit more important.”\nShirley notes that the fictional worlds science fiction authors often create are not what constitute science. Nor does\nscience directly drive the plot lines. Rather, science fiction invites the audience to entertain scenarios that force them\nto wrestle with the effect science has on society. She explains, “The technology is not the interesting part; it is what\npeople do with the technology.” Most science fiction deals with some sort of fallout, usually political, that comes from a\nnew event or technology. For example, Philip Dick’s 1952 short story Minority Report (later made into a film by Steven\nSpeilberg) posits a technology that allows the police to predict a crime. As Shirley explains, the story is not about the\ntechnology but “the political and legal ramifications of actually using such a system.” In short, science fiction is more\nabout asking thought-provoking questions than merely providing jaw-dropping special effects.\nThis focus on the dilemma, rather than the technology, is what allows science fiction stories to remain relevant even\nwhen the world and technology advances past the time of a story’s creation. Shirley points out an exhibit at the\nmuseum that shows how H.G. Wells’s 1905 novel War of the Worlds has been continually “remade and re-released\nevery time there was a perceived existential threat on this world.” Prior to World War II, Orson Welles did his famous\nradio broadcast. Then, the story was made into a movie at the start of the Cold War, and, again, in 2004 by Stephen\nSpielberg, who used imagery evocative of the 9-11 attacks.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n33\n\nWhat Inspires Them: Science Fiction’s Impact on\nScience Reality\nShirley sees several trends in how science fiction is wrestling with the modern world. The first is a trend towards more\nwomen writers entering the field, pointing to the pioneering work of the recently deceased Octavia Butler, one of the first\nAfrican American women science fiction writers and the only science fiction author to receive a MacArthur Foundation\n“genius” grant. This has a growing impact on topics. “Women writers tend to write more about the social stuff and what\nhappens to people.” There is also an evident increase in focus on the impact of computers and robotics. She notes the\nwork of writers such as Neal Stephenson and Bruce Sterling, who helped found the cyberpunk movement. This trend\nemphasizes not only the coming technology but also what happens when, as Shirley says, it is placed “in the hands\nof our depraved society.”\n\nScience Fiction and War\n“I thought Ender’s Game might be popular when I finished writing it—high-tension story, semi-tragic outcome. I did not\nexpect it to last as long as it has (so far) or to become as widely read by adults, teenagers, and children. Or, to put it\nanother way, I think all my books will do wonderfully well when I’m through writing them; with Ender’s Game, I happened\nto be right.”4\nOrson Scott Card has written fifty-nine books that have sold twenty million copies in North America alone. But it is still\nEnder’s Game (1985) for which he is best known. The story of Ender Wiggin, a child who expertly fights war as if it\nwere a sport, has won every major science fiction award, has been translated into eighteen languages, and is under\ndevelopment at Warner Brothers to be a major movie.\nMore importantly, the book’s stories of the command school of the future and of experiencing war from afar via virtual\nreality struck a particular chord with the military. Some two decades after its publication, it is still on various military\ncourse catalogs (such as at the Marine Corps University, where it is used as a text on the psychology of leadership),\nas well as various required reading lists that generals and admirals tell their officers they should read if they want to be\ngood warriors under their command.\nHe may be a writer of fiction, but like many in the field, Card also consults for the military, speaking on topics such as\n“Next Generation WMD: Anticipating the Threat.” Interestingly, for such an accomplished and influential writer, he grew\nup with little interest in science fiction or its links to war: “I did not grow up dreaming of writing sci-fi...Science fiction\nonly entered into my thinking rather late, and only as a sideline, a hobby—I was going to write plays. Then my theatre\ncompany collapsed in debts I couldn’t pay; I had to earn money.”\nCard is not surprised by the response his book has gotten from military readers. “Soldiers feel like Ender’s Game is\ntelling their story—young people doing their duty in spite of the idiocies of the officers who lead them. But I get similar\nresponses from gifted schoolchildren and from kids who do very badly in school, each of them seizing on the heroismin-isolation of Ender and extrapolating it to their own lives.”\nCard’s work is representative of a broader trend in science fiction, its overwhelming focus on war. While science fiction\nis known for peering into the future and bringing to light new fanciful technologies, the vast bulk of it places these stories\nand technologies in one particular context of our human experience, war. Each year, approximately five major science\nfiction movies that link to war are released. Fifteen of the ongoing science fiction TV series have a conflict or military\nelement. The thirty-five science fiction magazines in the field each carry multiple stories set in war. And, if you attend any\nof the fifty-two major science fiction conventions, your costume is most likely to pack a phaser, light saber, or blaster\nrifle. What some call “military science fiction” is by far the most popular part of the genre.\nThe reason why such a huge percentage of science fiction deals with issues of war, tells Card, is “Because war is a\nhuman constant. War also drives technological advance. And insofar as sci-fi was and remains a male genre, war will\ncontinue to fascinate readers.” He is more curious about why other genres don’t pay as much attention to war. “The real\nquestion,” Card asks, “Is why war is not more important in mainstream fiction?...Literary fiction generally skips over two\nof the primary occupations of humankind: war and religion. At least science fiction and fantasy can still address those\ntopics, along with everything else that literature can talk about.”\nOther writers point out that war is so popular in the genre because it is an unparalleled platform for wrestling with deep\nissues. Robin Wayne Bailey, president of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (a trade association for scifi writers; like the Teamsters with pointy ears), explains, “The conflict is obvious (in war), the opportunities for technologic\nexploration and idea exploration are vast, as is the case in real war as well, and war provides both a microcosm and\nmacrocosm for exploring human nature, and most pertinently human nature under stress.” Harry Turtledove and Martin\nGreenberg, noted authors themselves and the editors of a master volume of the field titled The Best Military Science\nFiction of the 20th Century, agree: “Fiction is about characters under stress. What we do when the heat is on reveals\nfar more about us than how we behave in ordinary times.”\nScience fiction authors have set their stories in the realm of war since the very start of the field. H.G. Wells is perhaps\nthe best known, but others include literary titans that we don’t often associate with science fiction, such as Arthur Conan\nDoyle, Jack London, and even A.A. Milne. Most know Milne as the creator of the lovable bear Winnie the Pooh, but\n\n34\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nWhat Inspires Them: Science Fiction’s Impact on\nScience Reality\nin 1909, he wrote a science fiction short story, titled “The Story of the Army Aeroplane.” Just six years after the Wright\nbrothers, it predicted that man might one day use those crazy flying machines for war.\nThe most influential author in developing the link between science fiction and war has to be Robert Heinlein. Heinlein\ncame from a military background, graduating from the Naval Academy in 1929 and serving until 1934, when he was\ndischarged for health reasons (during his convalescence, he invented the waterbed). When World War II started,\nHeinlein went back to work for the Navy doing aeronautical engineering. Interestingly, he recruited two young engineers\nto join his work at the Philadelphia Naval Yard, Isaac Asimov and L. Sprague de Camp, both of whom would later\nbecome among the biggest names in the history of science fiction.\nAfter the war, Heinlein became a key person in breaking science fiction into the mainstream, including being the first\nwriter in the field to pen for The Saturday Evening Post. Over the course of his career, Heinlein would write thirtytwo novels and fifty-nine short stories. But his two most influential were Stranger in a Strange Land (1961), which\nforeshadowed the “free love” of the sexual revolution and was embraced by the hippie movement, and Starship\nTroopers (1959), which, by contrast, is on the reading lists at the major military service academies, and inspired several\ntechnologies, such as robotic fighting suits.\nIn recognition of Heinlein’s popularity and influence, the U.S. Naval Academy even has an endowed professorship\nnamed for him, the Robert A. Heinlein Chair in Aerospace Engineering. There is also a movement to have one of the\nNavy’s newest warships named the U.S.S. Robert Heinlein, in honor of his 100th birthday. As the petition letter to the\nSecretary of Navy reads, “It only seems fitting that a man who spent his life writing about the 21st century should have\na 21st century destroyer named after him.” 5\n\nThrough the Looking Glass: Sci-Fi Predictions\nPart of the popularity and influence of science fiction comes from its remarkable record at foreshadowing the future.\nFor a fictional genre that often takes place in settings that don’t even exist, science fiction has forecast real world\ntechnologies, as well as resulting dilemmas, with stunning accuracy.\nPerhaps the best example of how predictive science fiction can be is the work of H.G. Wells, who is known as The\nFather of Science Fiction. Wells was born in 1866, but his various stories forecast the twentieth century with a nearincredible vision, predicting such things as computers, video cassette players, televisions, and even super highways,\neach of which seemed unfathomable at the time. His books often had a theme of conflict running through them, and\nso he also predicted various military developments well before their time. For example, in 1903, he wrote about tanks\n(or what he called “Land Ironclads”), which inspired Winston Churchill to champion their development a decade later.\nSimilarly, his book The Shape of Things to Come (1933), predicted a world war that would feature the aerial bombing\nof cities. Wells was not a fan of such technologies, as he saw them as “unsporting.”\nPerhaps Wells’s most important and influential prediction was in his story The World Set Free, written in 1911. He\nforecast a new type of weapon made of radioactive materials, which he called “the atomic bomb.” At the time,\nphysicists thought radioactive elements like uranium only released energy via a slow decay over thousands of years.\nWells described a way in which the energy might be bundled up to make an explosion powerful enough to destroy a\ncity. Of course, at the time, most scoffed, even the famed scientist Ernest Rutherford called Wells’s idea “moonshine.”\nOne reader who differed was Leó Szilárd, a Hungarian scientist. Szilárd later became a key member of the Manhattan\nProject and credited Wells’s book with giving him the idea for the nuclear “chain reaction.” Indeed, he even mailed a\ncopy of Wells’s book to Hugo Hirst, one of the founders of General Electric, with a cover note that read, “The forecast\nof the writers may prove to be more accurate than the forecast of the scientists.”6\nWells’s story ends with scientists trying to organize an effort against war and the use of the new bombs. The idea later\ninspired Szilárd, Einstein, and others to form the Pugwash nuclear disarmament movement, meaning Wells’s book, in\nturn, is the inspiration for the modern arms control movement, as well as the robotic “refuseniks” who now are organizing\nto prevent military use of their inventions.\nPerhaps the only equal to Wells was the work of Jules Verne, who has been called The Man Who Invented Tomorrow.\nBorn in 1828, Verne wrote Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea, among others, well before such things as largescale submarines existed. His greatest prediction may have been in his so-called lost novel. In 1863, Verne wrote a\nbook titled Paris in the 20th Century. In it, he predicted a future that would have skyscraper buildings made of glass,\nautomobiles powered by gasoline, calculators, worldwide communications, and even electronic music. To give a sense\nof how impressive this was, at the time Verne was writing, the electric light bulb hadn’t even been invented and the U.S.\nwas locked in a civil war over whether human beings could be owned as slaves. What is more, Verne predicted that\nnone of these fantastic improvements would make people happy. Instead, he foresaw that the technology advances\nwould turn into a crass commercialism that would overwhelm worthwhile arts and culture. The publisher didn’t like this\ndark, yet admittedly accurate, prediction of the future and rejected it. They published his Journey to the Center of the\nEarth instead, and the manuscript stayed locked away in a safe until 1994.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n35\n\nWhat Inspires Them: Science Fiction’s Impact on\nScience Reality\nScience fiction continued to tap into the future throughout the twentieth century, as the field extended into film and TV.\nThe only difference was that, with the speeded up timeframes, the imagined technology came to fruition much quicker.\nFor example, Stanley Kubrick’s film A Clockwork Orange (1971) predicted futuristic small music devices (what we would\nnow call MP-3 players or iPods), while in The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976), David Bowie plays a futuristic alien who\ndevelops an equally futuristic technology, what we now know as digital cameras. Indeed, even the animated sitcom The\nJetsons proved prophetic. George Jetson worked at Spacely Sprockets, pushing computer buttons as a “Digital Index\nOperator.” Spending your day in front of a computer seemed wildly futuristic in the 1960s, but pretty much describes\nmost of our jobs today.\nBy comparison, government often has a relatively poor track record when it comes to predicting the future. For example,\nin 1913, the U.S. government actually prosecuted Lee de Forest of RCA for telling investors that his company would\nsoon be able to transmit the human voice across the Atlantic Ocean. The idea seemed so absurd to the government\nthat they assumed de Forest was a swindler. Indeed, in his 1996 award-winning study, On Political Judgment, Phillip\nTetlock found that the professional “experts” who advise government are actually more often wrong in their predictions\nthan right. Industry equally has a mixed track record. For example, IBM president Thomas Watson famously said in\n1943, “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.”7\nIn the case of war, the same pattern holds. In an article from 2006 in Armed Forces Journal, one of the leading\nmagazines for U.S. military officers, it is noted, “We don’t do well, historically, in predicting the location and nature of\nthe next war.”8 For example, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, wrote a short story in 1914,\njust before World War I started. Titled “Danger,” it warned that the new invention of submarines might be used to sink\nmerchant ships. The Royal Navy’s Admiralty actually went public to refute and mock Doyle, saying, “No nation would\npermit it and the officer who did it would be shot.” Just seven months later, a German U-boat torpedoed the passenger\nship Lusitania, inaugurating the era of submarine warfare, which would almost starve Britain into submission. Part of the\nreason for this pattern is that while science fiction looks forward, the military typically plans what the next war will look\nlike by looking at how it fought the last one. In discussing how the American army that invaded Iraq in 2003 planned for\nit to be a repeat of the 1991 Gulf War, Armed Forces Journal concludes, “Our advances in technical intelligence have\nnot improved our ability to predict any specific war.”9\nThere are a couple of explanations for why science fiction tends to do well in prediction, even though it is working\nin the world of fiction. Many science fiction writers are scientists themselves, so they are typically well equipped to\nstay within the rules of science, yet extrapolate forward. Arthur C. Clarke, for instance, not only imagined a world of\nintelligent computers, but he is also the man who invented the real world communications satellite. As Donna Shirley\nexplains, science fiction authors tend to get their predictions right because they are most often writing about what they\nknow best: “Modern science fiction is increasingly being written by computer geeks, who are already experts on the\ntechnology side.”\nSecondly, these writers must create a narrative at some point (that is, the plot, which usually involves a battle of good\nversus evil, hence the frequent setting of war), but along the way, they must solve the same technical problems that real\nscientists do. However, they don’t have the constraints of a budget or lab time or bureaucratic politics. The freedom of\nthe fictional world allows them to work out solutions sometimes easier than in the real world. As one computer scientist\nnoted, “Science fiction is not making predictions, but playing with possibilities.” 10\nFinally, dealing with the “What if?” is what sets science fiction apart from regular fiction, as well as real world science.\nShirley explains, “The best science fiction deals more with the social consequences of technology change than the\ntechnology itself.” It’s the combination of scientific awareness with human imagination that allows science fiction to\nbetter deal with what happens when technology is put in a complex social setting. Science fiction author Robin Wayne\nBailey sums it this way: “Science fiction at its best is about ideas. Maybe, it’s criticized for often having wooden\ncharacters or unrealistic settings, but the ideas always come first...Science Fiction throws out ideas like some people\nscatter seeds. Most do not take root, but some do. And when they do, it is fabulous.” 11\nIt is important to note that in this seed scattering of ideas, science fiction is not always perfect. As Donna Shirley notes,\n“Science fiction did not predict computers very well at least until HAL...The same for Martians. Mariner 4 [the planetary\nprobe] killed all the Martians in 1965.”\nWhere science fiction tends to go most wrong in its predictions is not in the technology but in the timelines. Ray\nKurzweil, who makes a living out of timing technology predictions, explains: “Science fiction is unreliable because [there\nis] no requirement that the timeframe be realistic. Arthur C. Clarke chose the year 2001 as a literary device, not because\nthat’s when he was certain AI would come to fruition.” Shirley agrees in a way: “The technology is changing so rapidly,\nthey [science fiction writers] are increasingly having trouble keeping up.”\nOrson Scott Card thinks that holding science fiction to any standard for its prediction is beside the point. “Predicting\nis a trivial aspect of writing science fiction. We are extrapolating what would happen if a particular configuration of\nfuture possibilities became real. The result is that we plunge readers into an environment in which they must rebuild\ntheir conception of reality. So we aren’t predicting the future, we’re helping readers rehearse for the future, whatever it\n\n36\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nWhat Inspires Them: Science Fiction’s Impact on\nScience Reality\nmight bring.” He continues, “The job of the sci-fi writer is to envision all possibilities and bring them to life in the readers’\nimagination. What impact that will have is always debatable—less and less, these days, I believe. When things go\nhorribly wrong, it’s small satisfaction to say ‘I told you so.’”\n\nTurning Dreams into Reality\n“There is a back and forth between dreams and reality. Science fiction offers the dreams, the engineers make it the\nreality, and the readers are the ones who pilot the technology in planes, cars, rockets, whatever.”\nGreg Bear is the author of more than thirty books, and he has won two Hugo and five Nebula Awards (the science fiction\nversion of the Pulitzer Prize). His most recent novel is Quantico (2005), a thriller set in the “second decade of the War\non Terror” about young FBI agents taking on a brilliant homegrown terrorist. The book flap captures it best: “It’s the near\nfuture—sooner than you might hope.” 12\nBear is especially well equipped to reflect on how science fiction doesn’t just predict but also inspires real world\nchanges, as his name is frequently mentioned in the military research community. For example, an Air Force Lieutenant\nColonel commented how he even footnoted Bear’s work in a project proposal. By way of explanation he asks, “I mean,\nhow many science fiction books have appendices and glossaries?” 13\nGrowing up “a Navy brat,” who moved with his father from bases in California and Japan to the Philippines, Bear recalls,\n“In my living memory I don’t know a time when science fiction wasn’t in my life.” He started writing at eleven years old\nand sold his first story at age fifteen. The next year he met his hero, science fiction writer Ray Bradbury, and his career\nas a writer was decided.\nSince that time, The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Science Fiction has called Bear the “Best working writer of hard science\nfiction.” His impact, though, is decidedly beyond the world of fiction. Bear has served on various political and scientific\naction committees and advises the U.S. Army, the CIA, Sandia National Laboratories, and Microsoft Corporation on\nfuture issues. Indeed, when we spoke, Bear was just back from headlining a government conference on biotechnology\nthreats, inspired in part by his 1999 book Darwin’s Radio.\nBear is also one of the core members of SIGMA, a “think tank of patriotic science fiction writers.” 14 Arlan Andrews, a\nwriter who also worked at the White House Science Office, started SIGMA. “If you don’t read science fiction, you’re\nnot qualified to talk about the future,” Andrews said. Since the 9-11 attacks, SIGMA has worked closely with the\nDepartment of Homeland Security and influenced it, in particular, to set up the Homeland Security Advanced Research\nProjects Agency or HSARPA. A parallel to the Defense Department’s DARPA, HSARPA spends about $7 million a year\n(1 percent of the agency’s budget) on futuristic, “high impact” projects. At a government conference where authors like\nBear spoke in 2007, a government official defended the science fiction link to policy. “Congress asks me how can I\nafford to roll the dice with 1 percent of the taxpayers’ money,” says Jay Cohen, head of Homeland Security’s Science\nand Technology Directorate. “I say there are bad people in the caves of Tora Bora who are rolling the dice with 100\npercent of their money.” 15\nBear sees the influence of his work and his access to policymakers as coming, in part, from the focus on conflict.\nReferring to the many military readers of his work, he says, “If you lead the life, you tend to choose to read fiction about\nit.”16 He also sees science fiction’s influence spreading via its crossover into popular technologic thriller authors such\nas Tom Clancy and Dan Brown, who are especially popular among military readers.\nThis fandom extends to the top. “There is a pretty striking amount of government officials that read science fiction,”\nBear tells. “Harry Truman loved science fiction. He was an ‘other planets’ type of guy....Reagan liked the older writers\nlike Jules Verne and Edgar Rice Boroughs. Reagan even gave [promotional] quotes to writers and was not averse to\nreceiving papers from them, when he was President.” He goes on to note that, as someone who leans left in his politics,\nhe’s somewhat disappointed that recent Democrats tend to be less likely than the Republicans to be science fiction\nfans or pull in science fiction advice. “They seem to be more like FDR and get into the legal thrillers and mysteries.”\n\nDirect Inspiration, or “How William Shatner Changed the World”\nScience fiction may be incredibly popular, but raw fandom doesn’t necessarily translate into influence. If that were\nthe case, Hannah Montana would be the most influential person on the planet at this time. Rather, science fiction’s\ninfluence on real world science and even war comes through a variety of pathways. The simplest is the direct way,\ngiving scientists ideas of what to invent. Nothing proves this better than Star Trek. Or, as William Shatner (the actor who\nportrayed Captain Kirk on the original series) claims, “All this wiz-bangering didn’t happen by accident. I made it happen.\nOr rather Star Trek did.” 17\nWhile the original series only lasted three years (1966–69) before it was cancelled by NBC due to low ratings, Star Trek\nhas since boldly gone where no work of fiction has gone before. It spun off five other TV shows, ten movies (an eleventh\nis in the works), an entire library of books (Amazon.com lists 4,276 Star Trek books), and a city’s worth of exhibits, rides,\nand museums. The mecca of all this is the Star Trek: The Experience, an interactive museum at the Las Vegas Hilton\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n37\n\nWhat Inspires Them: Science Fiction’s Impact on\nScience Reality\nhotel and casino. Where Elvis used to do his famous Viva Las Vegas show, today you can drink a Commander RikerRita at Quark’s Bar or renew your Vulcan wedding vows. All told, the Washington Post estimates that the worldwide fan\nbase is 250 million Trekkies strong.18\nThe original show came out of the vision of Gene Roddenberry, a World War II bomber pilot turned Hollywood producer.\nWhile he wanted technology that “looked futuristic,” the reality often had a different point of origin. For example, many\nrecall the famous “transporter” that, each episode, would beam Kirk, Spock, and an anonymous, certain to die, redshirted crewman down to the planet’s surface. Screenwriters now tell that the origin of the transporter actually came\nabout when the prop company didn’t deliver a mockup of a shuttlecraft in time.\nThese ideas, however, certainly made an impression on a generation of kids turned scientists. They became determined\nto make the world have technology just like they had seen their heroes use in their favorite show. Martin Cooper, the\ninventor of the cell phone, recalls that his “eureka” moment of inspiration came when watching a Star Trek episode in\nhis lab. “There’s Captain Kirk, talking on a communicator, without dialing! I think ‘This thing is genius.’...The Star Trek\ncommunicator to us wasn’t a fantasy. It was an objective.” 19 Similarly, John Adler of Stanford medical school observes\nthat Dr. McCoy’s sickbay “revolutionized the way we think about patient care.” 20 Inspired by Bones’s medical tricorder\n(actually just a tricked out saltshaker), Adler revolutionized the medical field by inventing the cyber knife, which does\nsurgery by sending a beam into cancer tumors. Rob Hatani, who was equally inspired by the tricorder to invent the Palm\nPilot PDA, explains that this degree of influence is to be expected, given the popularity of the show. “In Silicon Valley,\neveryone’s a Star Trek fan. It’s like football in Green Bay.” 21\nThe franchise and its influence were reborn again in the 1980s with Star Trek: The Next Generation. The successor\nseries differed in often focusing on the darker side of technology (such as its introduction of the Borg, the new adversary\nspecies, whose robotic technology had eradicated all empathy), but it, too, had major influence on scientists. For\nexample, Steve Perlman recalls his inspiration moment came when watching an episode in which the robot Data relaxes\nby listening to several symphonies stored on his computer. Perlman went on to invent QuickTime, a software program\nthat stores and plays electronic audio and video files. This, in turn, helped make possible iPods and other portable digital\nmusic players. Today, Perlman is working to make a virtual reality playroom, modeled after the Enterprise’s Holo-Deck.\nThe inspirational role of science fiction extends beyond the world of Trekkies and is especially pronounced in military\ntechnology. An illustration comes from an anthology of short stories titled The Best Military Science Fiction of the 20th\nCentury. 22 The volume is a collection of the most popular science fiction short stories, written from 1900 to 2000, set\nin war. What is noteworthy is that thirty-four technologies dreamed up in the last century are now under development by\nthe U.S. military in this century. These range from exoskeleton suits that soldiers might wear to an automated defense\nsystem for tanks, now called by the Pentagon, “Active Protection Systems.”\nThose working in the military weapons development field are often surprisingly open about where they get their ideas.\nColonel James Lasswell is a former infantry officer now at the Marine Corp Warfighting Lab. He tells, “The fact that it\nexists in our own movies proves that is potentially possible...If you can imagine it, we think it can happen.”23 When\npondering how to aid Marines in the battle against IEDs in Iraq, his team sent a request to DARPA to start working on\nwhat he called “Jedi Broomsticks,” that is, the hovering speeder bikes that appeared in Star Wars: The Return of the\nJedi. “We wanted ground mobility, but not on the ground.” The jet bikes are still not yet deployed, but another science\nfiction idea come true are miniature communications devices Marines can wear on their wrists and watch video footage\nshot by a UAV above. “We got the idea from Dick Tracy,” Lasswell chuckles.\nAs Andrew Bennett, who leads the design team at iRobot, says, “We were all influenced by science fiction. You are\nalways looking for ideas and science fiction is one of many sources.” 24 His colleague Bryan Yamaguchi laments, “But\nnow, we are finding that our stuff is getting more advanced than science fiction.” 25\n\nFunding Sci-Fi\nThe researchers are not the only ones who grow up on this diet of science fiction. So, too, do the funders who\ndecide which weapons programs to pay for. As former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (who actually visited Isaac\nAsimov’s apartment when he was in Congress) explains, “People like Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and Carl Sagan\ndid an amazing amount to convince humans that science and technology were important.” 26\nPerhaps the best illustration of this is at the Air Force Research Lab’s Directed Energy Directorate at Kirtland Air Force\nBase in New Mexico. In 2005, it rolled out a new prototype weapon with the mundane title, “Personnel Halting and\nStimulation Response,” or PHaSR. People in the military tend to speak out an acronym as if it were one word, rather\nthan reading the letters. So the whole convoluted name was just a way to call the Pentagon’s new weapon a “phaser,”\nthe little ray gun from Star Trek that Kirk always “set to stun” before he beamed off to explore new worlds and romance\nbuxom alien women. The system is essentially a laser-rifle whose beam can stun a target more than two hundred yards\naway, a non-lethal weapon perfect for mounting on a robot. When asked why they chose that name, program manager\nCaptain Thomas Wegner answers, “We picked the PHaSR name to help sell the program. It’s an obvious homage to\nStar Trek.” 27\n\n38\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nWhat Inspires Them: Science Fiction’s Impact on\nScience Reality\nIt is often difficult to figure out just what the future will look like, but science fiction creates both an expectation, as well as\nearly acceptance to technologies that are not yet present. As Bill Gates explains, Star Trek paved the way for his job at\nselling small, easy to use computers to the public: “It told the world that one day computers would be everywhere.” He sees\nthe same happening with robots from movies like Star Wars and I, Robot. “The popularity of robots in fiction indicates that\npeople are receptive to the idea that these machines will one day walk among us as helpers and even as companions.” 28\nMilitary robot developers see the same trend when selling to the Pentagon. One explains, “It’s a way to make possibilities\nseem real, but also inevitable.” Sometimes though, the popularity of science fiction among military funders can actually\nmake it harder on researchers. “Naval customers just assume it will happen,” explains Thomas McKenna at the Office\nof Naval Research. 29 Likewise, the military funders tend to want the cooler technologies, while the mundane are less\nlikely to be funded. One U.S. Army researcher working on non-lethal weapons systems complains, “You have to beg\nfor money for things like beanbags or acoustics. But say it’s for a laser or a light saber and the money is no problem.” 30\n\nThe Lens of the Looking Glass\n“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” famously argued English physicist and science\nfiction author Arthur C. Clarke. Indeed, when the warriors of the Hehe tribe in Tanzania surrounded a single German\ncolonist in 1891, they seemingly had little to fear. But he had a magic box that killed almost one thousand spear-armed\nwarriors by spitting out death faster than they ever imagined possible, the machine gun. 31\nNew technologies often can seem not merely incomprehensible, but unimaginable. Science fiction, though, allow us\nto jump that divide. It helps to take the shock out of what analysts call “Future-Shock.”32 By allowing us to imagine the\nunimaginable, it helps prepare us for the future, including even in war.\nThis preparation extends beyond future expectations; science fiction creates a frame of reference that shapes our\nhopes and fears about the future, as well as how we reflect on the ethics of some new technology. One set of human\nrights experts I queried on the laws of unmanned warfare referenced Blade Runner, Terminator, and Robocop with the\nsame weight as they did the Geneva Conventions. At another human rights organization, two leaders even got into a\ndebate over whether the combat scenes in Star Trek were realistic; their idea was that this could help determine whether\nthe fictional codes of the Federation could be used as real world guides for today’s tough ethical choices in war.\nBy far the most influential writer when it comes to the right and wrong of robots is Isaac Asimov. Every single roboticist\nknows Asimov’s “3 Laws” by heart, and they have become the reference point for ethical discussions about robots. Yet,\nthey are fiction, never intended for the real world. Instead, each of the stories in I, Robot uses the laws as a jumping off\npoint to look at the problems that occur when robots try to follow the laws in the complexity of the real world.\nMany of our expectations and ethical assumptions around real world robots come from science fiction. The irony is that\nthe same stories that inspire and fund the research can also create assumptions that are often incredibly frustrating to\nreal world researchers. As one scientist discussed, “There seems a strong tendency over the decades to view robots\nas something evil, like technology run amok.”33 These fears date back to the slaves of Karel ČCapek’s play R.U.R. (1921)\nand the mechanical minx Maria, an evil robot in Fritz Lang’s film Metropolis (1927); her ultimate evil was illustrated by the\nfact that she liked to both oppress the urban poor and dance exotically. They continue today in movie franchises such\nas The Terminator and Matrix. Bart Everett of the Navy lab describes it as a “paranoia” that “stems from the fact that\ndoomsday scenarios make for better movies. As a result, there is often confusion with regard to what the technology\nactually can and cannot do today, as well as where it’s headed in the future.” 34\nRegardless, the reality is that science fiction always lies in the forefront of debates over key questions such as to\nwhether robots should be armed or how much autonomy they should be given. Yet, this doesn’t drive the field towards\nany one conclusion. The galaxy of stories that writers have created is simply too diverse.\nIndeed, just as there is not one single world of regular fiction, there is no one culture of science fiction. The field itself can be\ndifferent across time and space and, thus, have changing influences on how we frame the world of science. For example,\nif Star Trek was dominant in the 1960s, Harry Potter is the power series of today. To put it another way, kids today are\ninfinitely more likely to know what a Chizpurfle is than a Tribble (for the uninitiated, a tiny, mite-like creature that feeds on both\nmagic and electricity vs. pink furballs that reproduce at exponential rates). Even though J.K Rowling created a world more\nof fantasy than science fiction, it shouldn’t be all that surprising that its influences are already being felt within the real world\nof war and weapons development. For example, researchers in both England and the U.S. (with DARPA funds) are now\nhard at work on an invisibility cloak that works just like the one young wizarding student Harry inherited from his father. The\nreal world one is set to be made of novel “metamaterials,” which can be tuned to bend radio waves and light, so that the\ncloak would neither reflect light nor cast a shadow (a true science fiction comparison would be the chameleon camouflage\nused by the alien in Predator). John Pendry, a physicist at the Imperial College London, notes that the Harry Potter link may\nnot be an exact one: “To be realistic, it’s going to be fairly thick. Cloak is a misnomer. ‘Shield’ might be more appropriate.” 35\nOlder scientists also note that, as Rodney Brooks of iRobot puts it, “There is becoming a generational difference in where\nthe science fiction influence comes from.” As he explains, his major influences were science fiction books. For his colleague\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n39\n\nWhat Inspires Them: Science Fiction’s Impact on\nScience Reality\nHelen Greiner, it was movies. Today, for his students at MIT, it is video games. “And I have no idea what will be the different\nimpact of these.”36 One may be that the “new media” allow better special effects but demand far less introspection. As\nsoldiers grow up more familiar with the first-person shooters of video games like Doom or Halo and less with the moral\nquestioning books like I, Robot or the “Prime Directive” dilemmas of Trek, we may find that the medium matters greatly.\nCulture also appears to play a role. Just as the French love their Jerry Lewis and the English their Benny Hill, the\npopularity and influence of certain science fictions are linked to national tastes. For example, Dr. Who is perhaps the\nmost popular sci-fi series in the United Kingdom, running for over a quarter-century on BBC (1963–89) and spinning\nout two movies. In the U.S., however, Dr. Who remains mainly a cult thing. Part of the explanation may lie in that the\nmain hero is, basically, an oddball, go-lucky sort of guy, who stumbles into trouble while flying about the world in a\nspaceship that looks like a phone booth. We Americans like our science fiction heroes to be a bit more strong, cool,\nand dangerous, like Star Wars’ Han Solo.\nIf the British and the Americans differ along these lines, science fiction truly leaps in culture between East and West,\nespecially when it comes to perceptions of robots. While the robot is consistently something suspicious in Western\nscience fiction, it is the exact opposite in Asian science fiction. Indeed, the very first popular robot in Japanese science\nfiction was the post-World War II “Mighty Atom,” also known as Astro-Boy. A robot that keeps the peace among\nhumankind, he was also a response to the role of the atom at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nTo this day in most Asian science fiction, especially in the anime genre, the robot is usually the hero who battles evil.\nThis has heavily influenced both Japanese scientists and its populace. “The machine is a friend of humans in Japan. A\nrobot is a friend, basically,” says Shuji Hasimoto, a robotics professor at Waseda University in Tokyo. “So, it is easy to\nuse machines in this country.”37\nJapan’s traditional religion of Shintoism holds that both animate and inanimate objects, from rocks to trees to robots, have\na spirit or soul just like a person. Thus, to endow a robot with a soul is not a logical leap in either fiction or reality. Indeed, in\nmany Japanese factories, robots are given Shinto rites and treated like members of the staff. Masahiro Mori, a professor\nat Tokyo Institute of Technology, explains that Buddhism also makes for a more soulful approach to what a Westerner\nwould see as just a tool or maybe a mechanical servant. Mori, who wrote the 1974 book The Buddha in the Robot, argues\nthat robots can have a Buddha-like nature and that humans should relate to them as they would a person. “If you make\nsomething, your heart will go into the thing you are making. So, a robot is an external self. If a robot is an external self, a\nrobot is your child.”38\nIn Asia, “companion” robots for the elderly are becoming quite common. One woman even found out she was dying of\nheart disease and included her Wakamura robot in her will. By contrast, Rodney Brooks of iRobot explains that mass\nmarketing robots as friends for elderly shut-ins is yet to be tried in the U.S. because most Americans find such a concept\n“too artificial and icky.”39 Sebastian Thrun, the Stanford professor who won the first robotic car race, tells how the differing\nscience fictions create a “willingness [in Asia] to go into new technologies and gadgets that is higher there than anywhere\nin the world.” 40 As a result, his lab has more collaboration with Asian companies than American ones.\nThe same differing attitudes and influences affect what different cultures think is acceptable in war. The question of arming\nunmanned systems and giving them the ability to shoot at humans is perhaps the most important issue within the U.S.\nrobotics community. It is far less controversial in Asia. Indeed, South Korea sent two robot snipers with rifles to Iraq in 2004\nwith essentially no debate; they were reported to have “nearly 100%” accuracy. 41\nEven more notable is the Autonomous Sentry Gun, made by Samsung. The company, more known for making highdefinition TVs, has integrated a machine gun with two cameras (infrared and zooming) and pattern-recognition software\nprocessors. The system cannot only identify, classify, and destroy moving targets from over a mile away, but as Louis\nRamirez of Gizmodo tells, “[it] also has a speaker that beckons the fool that walks near it to surrender before being\npulverized.” 42 South Korea plans to use the robo-machine guns to stand guard along the 155-mile demilitarized zone\n(DMZ) that borders North Korea.\nThe attitudinal differences become even more evident when you watch the promotional video put out by the company for\nits new toy. The footage shows the machine gun automatically tracking a human test subject, who unsuccessfully tries\nto dodge the robotic gun by running back and forth and hiding behind bushes. For something that a Westerner weaned\non a diet of Terminator movies can’t help but find disturbing, the vibe of the Korean commercial is a bit more celebratory.\nThe footage of a real world, automated machine gun tracking humans is paired with the rousing theme song of the Disney\nmovie Pirates of the Caribbean. 43\n\nThe Feedback Loop\n“There’s definitely a feedback between the sciences and science fiction,” says James Cameron, creator of Terminator,\nas well as a board member of the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame. “It flows both directions...Not only does\nscience fiction inspire people to become scientists and want to ask questions about the real nature of existence and\nmatter and reality, but what they’re finding then feeds back into the science fiction community, and gets embraced by\nthat, and spins out a whole new generation of science fiction.” 44\n\n40\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nWhat Inspires Them: Science Fiction’s Impact on\nScience Reality\nReal scientists, soldiers, and policymakers may be influenced by science fiction, but change is coming so quickly that\nthe creators of these imaginary worlds are increasingly borrowing from the real one. As Greg Bear notes, “I actually\nworry that science fiction isn’t keeping up.” Author and science fiction writers’ union head Robin Wayne Bailey concurs,\n“The military is doing a fine job with robotics. The toys they have could be placed within any science fiction story...but\nto see what they have on the drawing board is mind-boggling to even science fiction writers.”\nHowever, as science fiction experts look at some of what the military is doing today, many of them get frustrated.\nDonna Shirley may be the director of a science fiction museum in Seattle, but when the topic turns to the future of\nwar, she is as smart as any political analyst is inside the DC beltway. “The Pentagon just doesn’t get it. This high\ntechnology stuff just doesn’t work versus a distributed enemy like al Qaeda...No matter how many bunker busters\nyou can drop from afar, if you don’t know where someone is hiding it will not matter.” And don’t even get her started\non the plans for National Missile Defense. “The idea of trying to hit a bullet with a bullet is silly. It is much easier and\nefficient to place your interceptor system offshore and take the missile out early in the launch stage when it is slow\nand easy to target...But instead we are spending billions on the harder part just because it sounds really cool.”\nYet, the field still has a stigma that keeps its experts hidden away, even when on Pentagon contract. For all science\nfiction’s influence on the future of technology and even war, “It is ironic then that we are rarely invited to the table to\ndiscuss these issues openly,” laments Robin Wayne Bailey.\nPerhaps we as a society ought to be paying more attention to the world of science fiction. It not only predicts and\ninfluences the future, but nothing may prepare us better to assess the consequences of a new technology than a\nfield whose very essence is to ask questions about the moral, ethical, and societal dilemmas that new technologies\nmight provoke. As Donna Shirley explains, “Science fiction asks ‘What if?’ So, it doesn’t say how exactly you can\nbuild the bomb. Instead, it says, if you build this bomb, you are going to get Dr. Strangelove.”\n\nEndnotes\n1\n2\n3\n\nDONNA SHIRLEY, INTERVIEW BY PETER W.

Gage\n\nThe Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London\n\nAbstract\nA distinction is drawn between designing settings that are part of the performative framing of immediate behavior and,\nthe often more difficult task, constructing an architecture of possibilities.\nAnalogies are drawn to the work of stage magicians and software interface designers that suggests some attributes of\nboth of the above aspects of architecture.\nThe concept of “Utilitas” is explored both as a way of reducing variety so change can be introduced in an orderly manner\nand as a way of initiating a rich and complex user illusion.\n\nBackground\nThis paper is the second in a series written to show how concepts from cybernetics can help to illuminate and possibly\nresolve some central, linked questions in architecture. The first paper1 asked where delight (or wonder) and surprise\nmight lie in physical architecture. “Delight” is an attribute taken from Sir Henry Wooton’s Introduction to Vitruvius’ work.2\nVitruvius was a Roman architect whose texts are the first professional descriptions of architecture to survive from\nantiquity. One of the conclusions in the first paper is that it is possible for an architect to make architecture that is\ndelightful with no more than a very primitive understanding of the people who might inhabit it.\n\n44\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nConstructing the User\nWooton suggested that architecture should have the attributes of firmness and commodity in addition to delight.\nFirmness approximately translates into structural stability, durability, water-tightness, and thermal performance.\nCommodity is usually equated with usefulness. This paper is about usefulness in its broadest sense. In order to attribute\nusefulness to an object, we must begin to define to whom it is useful. An extension of this argument suggests that\narchitects should go to people and find out their wants and needs.\nA further extension suggests that architects should look at how people behave in the built environment and infer wants\nand needs from these observations. This approach led, in the 1960s and 1970s, to a form of research into the built\nenvironment that sought through survey techniques to establish the spatial requirements of defined organizations on the\none hand and the generalized rules about the behavior of people in the built environment on the other. A good example\nof the former is the “Activity Data Method” developed by Bruce Archer3 and a good example of the latter is the work of\nBill Hillier4 in developing the concepts that underpin “Space Syntax.”\nBoth of these approaches start with statements about what people will do (or are likely to do) in given circumstances.\nThese statements mesh together with the descriptions of the built environment to produce outcomes of considerable\ncomplexity. The descriptions of individuals are, however, simple and deterministic. Space Syntax rules can, for example,\nbe stated in the form of simple agent behavior, from which complex group behaviors can be shown to emerge. These\nbehaviors are similar to those that occur in other emergent systems.\nHow useful are these descriptions? Do they give us a sophisticated description of what is going on? Do they help\nus invent novel ways of making and occupying the built environment? This paper argues that the way that this type\nof description has evolved and is thought about stands in the way of sophistication and novelty. Sophistication and\nnovelty require invention, which in turn, requires a conceptualization of a future that cannot be predicted from the past.\n\nWhy are people predictable?\nThe great twentieth-century cybernetician Heinz von Foester described two metaphorical machines:5 machines that\ngive outputs of the type y=(f)x are trivial machines, and machines that give unpredictable outputs as a result of hidden\ninternal functional relationships are non-trivial machines. He argues that human beings are essentially non-trivial and that\nhuman invention and understanding can only be understood through the metaphor of the non-trivial machine.\nThe metaphor of the non-trivial machine cannot on its own explain the human:human and human:object systems that\nare manifested in the built environment. We only need to look at the world to realize that the behaviors of human beings\nin their environments are often extremely predictable. We know, for example, that in continental Europe, people always\ndrive on the right-hand side of the road and always travel on the right-hand escalator, while in the UK, they drive on the\nleft and take the left-hand escalator, where, however, they stand on the right. These are simple manifestations of social\nconventions operating in the built environment as trivial machines.\nHow do these conventions come about? Some startling experiments have demonstrated that the way we see the world\nis learned, and that it can be un-learned and re-learned with ease. Examples include research into vision where people\nwearing inverting prisms as spectacles re-learn “up” and “down” within six to ten days sufficiently well to function in an\nupside-down world.6 Perhaps human beings can be likened to essentially non-trivial machines that negotiate the world\nby individually, but more often collectively, trivializing it.\nConventions are ways of dealing with the world, reducing variety, and making it less scary. There is an implication that\nthe worlds we construct in this way tend towards stability. Observation suggests that this is not the case; the way that\nwe behave in the built environment is continually changing, both in terms of our behaviors and in terms of the physical\ncontext of that environment. How are conventions learned, maintained, and ultimately changed and re-established?\n\nLearning\nA likely social learning mechanism is mimicry and affirmation.7 This occurs when an observer in a system of conventions\ncopies a behavior that he or she observes in response to a particular signal, and is rewarded by affirmative behavior\nfrom another, more experienced observer in the system that the behavior is, indeed, correct. The first observer in the\nsystem has to construct and experiment with a range of potentially correct behaviors before the appropriate response\nis achieved. When this happens, the observer in the system has performed an appropriate y=(f)x routine.\nIn this, we are an “advanced” society no different from our ancestors in superficially simpler groupings. We learn to perform\nthe elements of our culture in much the same way as a pupil learns to type on Gordon Pask’s SAKI self-adaptive keyboard\ninstructor8 or a tribal initiate learns the totemic distinctions described in Levi Strauss’s The Savage Mind.9 The keyboard\nthat is learned using the SAKI machine is in itself a physically constructed social convention. It is so thoroughly embedded\nin Western culture that it is hard to imagine how it will ever be abandoned. The reason it is so thoroughly embedded is\nthat it is very widely and consistently used. Levi Strauss describes the fragility of meaning in totemic structures and how\nthey are maintained through stories and rituals. Once achieved, the routine must be repeated as a performance in order\nto sustain the convention. This is best done with others. We can speculate that, because we are social animals, group\nrepeating of a convention will maintain the convention more powerfully than the equivalent sum of individual repetitions.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n45\n\nConstructing the User\nMaintenance and performance\nBeeman10 describes how performance is both mimetic (in that it imitates action) and affective (in that it transforms\naction). An anthropological view of performance is that it encompasses all institutions of public behavior, including those\nwhich control and direct ritual and social interactions. The built environment contains both the settings and the props for\nthe performance of the everyday. Beeman quotes Bauman to describe how performance is always “emergent” but “in\nthe context of the ground rules for the conduct of performance that make up the structured system of conventionalized\nperformance for the community.” This is close to concepts of emergence that are derived from the agent-based\nrepresentation of social interaction. It is also close to the behaviors that are displayed by the various protagonists in\nan effective major public hospital. Unfortunately, the same approach can also be taken to a major public hanging in\na society where hangings are still part of “the structured system of conventionalized performance for the community.”\n\nInvention\nGregory Bateson11 described the notion of “framing” in his essay, “A Theory of Play and Fantasy.” He described play\nas a quintessential example of “Framed Behavior,” whose individuals regulate their behavior according to a set of rules\nthat operate only as long as the play frame is in force. Bateson distinguishes this from “ordinary life.” Those involved in\nthe making of the built environment and the activities within it do not have the luxury of believing that ordinary life exists\nsomewhere outside their area of operation. Goffman takes a similar concept of framing and places it in everyday life\nfrom a psychological standpoint.12 More recently, this concept has been used to examine the way that large-scale and\nimmediate social action takes place. For example, Victor Argothy13 shows how the press framed the presentation of the\n9-11 assaults on the World Trade Center, and how that constructed frame structured mass volunteering by members\nof the public in the wake of the tragedy. The concept of framing has recently been used as a tool in the construction of\nmulti-agent software systems.14 The concepts of framing can also apply directly to the built environment, as long as it\nis recognized that the frame contains both a physical construct and a cluster of congruent mental constructs. The latter\nare expressed in predictable behaviors.\n\nBottom up or top down?\nIf human behavior in the built environment is analogous to that of children’s when playing a game, we must ask how the\ngame might be created. There appear to be two conflicting possibilities. It could be argued that social behaviors are the\nproduct of the interaction of autonomous agents, a “bottom-up” approach. Cyberneticians in general are attracted to\nthe idea that the process of constructing social convention is best done in this way. We can hypothesize a number of\nreasons for this. One is the liberal political position that underpins the work of Norbert Wiener, Ross Ashby, and Heinz\nVon Foester. A second is the undoubted potential inherent in tapping the capabilities and invention of a large number\nof human beings rather than a few. A third reason might be the slightly dated feel that a “top-down” approach conjures\nup—an image of social control engineering.\nOn the whole, cyberneticians are really nice people and recoil at the thought that they might be involved in constructing\nrealities that involve taking people’s money, overfeeding them, and locking them up, even if other hypothetical realities\ninclude helping people to get well, offering them the opportunity to learn and to live in comfortable surroundings. The\nreverse is generally true of architects, however nice they may be as people. The production of a building is generally\nthought to be a top-down process, even if the reality is more complex than this and involves a large number of\nstakeholders each performing a very specific role.\n\nA theatrical model\nPangaro neatly sidestepped the ethical problem of a “top-down” approach in his paper “Pask as Dramaturg.” In it,\nPangaro describes the top-down approach as “organizational modeling,” identifying the essentially auto-poetic quality\nthat underlies the creation of a performance that did not previously exist. He describes, in relation to Pask, how these\ncreations contain the detritus of earlier ideas reformulated to be new vibrant entities. By focusing on Pask, Pangar draws\nattention to the extraordinary creative pleasure that can exist in a team that invents the future.\nThe theatrical model has one great attribute: by including the audience as “observers in” the system, we immediately\noffer them the possibility of disbelief and boredom. Disbelief and boredom are major drivers of change in a human\nconstruct that is otherwise working. This applies in “everyday life.” While in everyday life it is not always possible to walk\nout of the show altogether, there is usually something else going on in another part of town.\n\nTwo types of observer\nWhat are the basic characteristics of the theatrical top-down system? A minimum meta description of a top-down social\nsystem includes “creators of” the system and “observers in” the system; the creators both design the system and find\nthe initial resources to make it happen. I will argue that the “observers in” the system are either “active” or “passive,” and\nthat the distinction between active and passive is critical.\nGordon Pask15 was one of the great twentieth-century second-order cyberneticians. Like Heinz Von Foerster, he was a\nperformer and a showman. He also built objects that went beyond demonstrations and explorations­. He built artifacts\nto entertain and engage his audience—pieces of interactive architecture that are as fresh today as they were when he\n\n46\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nConstructing the User\nfirst created them 50 to 60 years ago, even though today we only have his account of them.16 Although Pask was both\negocentric and eccentric, his interactive architecture started with an appreciation of an observer’s point of view. He\nplaced the observer’s aesthetic17 appreciation of his work at the center of many of his endeavors.\nIn Pask’s view, an aesthetically potent environment should have the following attributes:\na) It must offer sufficient variety to provide the potentially controllable novelty required by a man.18 (However, it must not\nswamp him with variety—if it did, the environment would merely be unintelligible.)\nb) It must contain forms that a man can interpret or learn to interpret at various levels of abstraction.\nc) It must provide cues or tacitly stated instructions to guide the learning and abstractive process.\nd) It may, in addition, respond to a man, engage him in conversation, and adapt its characteristics to the prevailing\nmode of discourse.\nPask goes on in his paper to describe his “Musicolour” machine (an interactive music and lighting device that needed a\npantechnicon to move it, and which made its final appearance in 1957) and his “Colloquy of Mobiles” (a group of three\ninteracting mobiles that also interact with their observers. This was exhibited at the Cybernetic Serendipity Exhibition\nat the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1968). Both machines were technologically ambitious, both entertained their\naudiences, and both had an inbuilt attribute that Pask considered a problem, which could be considered a result of\nPask’s own abilities as a performer.\nPask described how the Musicolour light system interacted with a group of musicians and could interact with the\npublic who were dancing (via the group of musicians). In reality, the public was easily distracted from the lights and\nresponded to the musicians directly. He also described how the Colloquy of Mobiles worked in much the same way,\nin that the public could interact with the mobiles through their light signaling arrays. In reality, in moderate light levels,\nthe public was easily distracted by the moving mobiles and did not try to intercept their signaling “conversations.” Both\nphenomena are capable of a simple explanation, which is that there are, in a group situation, at least two different\nclasses of observers: those that interact and those that observe interaction.\n\nBoredom and novelty\nPask’s description of how a performing system\nmust present a degree of novelty to its observer\nis given in point a) above. He also describes, in\nthe same paper, how a constructed performative\nsystem becomes “bored.” Indeed, both the\nMusicolour and the Colloquy of Mobiles contain\nelectromechanical functions that he describes\nas the machines “getting bored.” In the absence\nof any input stimulus, the system becomes\nincreasingly sensitive. When there is repetitive\ninput, the system “directs its attention” to the\npotentially novel. Although “boredom,” in this\ncase, is a metaphor, it is likely that Pask was of\nthe opinion that boredom and a need for novelty\nexist in all classes of observers in a performative\nsystem. It could be argued that boredom becomes more likely when observers are consciously aware that the\nconstruct has been constructed—and is consequently mutable—and that it can be changed. This argument leads to a\npossible hypothesis, which is that an urge for novelty and change may be greatest among the “creators of” these social\nconstructs. Because Pask was a creator of performances, he built his own expectation of boredom into his machines.\nThe “creators of” a top-down system inevitably become the “observers in” the system as time proceeds.\n\nA landscape of trivial machines or a user illusion?\nAny form of built environment is immediately experienced through a variety of senses, and is constructed by the observer\nthrough a process of learning. The constructed experience is the subject of potential delight in Wooton’s terms. How is\nthis to be induced? The arguments contained in “The wonder of trivial machines”19 suggest that an environment could\nbe constructed out of an array of exquisite objects: enclosing structures, lighting systems, environmental modulators,\nroutes, passages. The “observers in” these worlds of natural magic would construct their own understandings and\nwould be delighted in the process of doing this. Wherever possible, the physical constructs would be laid out to engage\nseasonal variation and moment-to-moment changes in the natural weather systems, so that the observers in these\nbuildings and landscapes are offered the possibility of repeatedly reconstructing their environments.\nThe reality is that this approach is rarely tried. Something else is being attempted: buildings and spaces are constructed\nto embody adjectival qualities such as “biggest,” “tallest,” “boldest.” However, we live in an age of unprecedented\nbuilding and landscape conservation. The punters, the “observers in” the worlds that are being constructed, are\nclearly not that enthusiastic about them, preferring the worlds that were constructed some centuries ago, mostly in the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, as a result of Sir Henry Wooton’s work.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n47\n\nConstructing the User\nThe architecture that Wooton promoted was the illusory\nrepresentation of an architecture that was, by then, fifteen\nhundred years old, and which was, itself, largely a representation\nof an architecture that was five hundred years old at the time. An\narchitecture that is founded on illusion has considerable staying\npower, possibly because it has the concept of an audience\nembedded in it. A durable architecture of possibilities may be\nconstructed as an architecture of illusions.\nAn explicit consideration of audience and illusion leads us to\nconsider the relationship between the practice of stage magic and\nthe creation of both physical and “virtual” architecture. The stage\nmagician has to thoroughly consider his or her audience. Bruce\nTognazzini describes this in an article that draws parallels between\nmagic and the software design that supports graphical user\ninterfaces.20 Tognazzini finds an eerie correspondence between\nthe two:\n“Perhaps no field other than magic is tied so closely to the field of graphical interface design: the people working\nat Xerox PARC of the 1960s and early 1970s were aware of the principles of theatrical magic when creating the\nfirst graphical interfaces, to the extent that David Smith named the interface itself the “user illusion.”21 We are\ndesigning interfaces for an interface system based on magic, yet there is almost nothing written about it in our\nliterature. Magicians have been struggling with the principles, techniques and ethics of illusion for at least 5000\nyears. There is a lot we can learn from them.”\nThe identification of two parallel realities is the key to understanding magic. “Actually there are two simultaneous acts\nperformed in magic: the one the magician actually does—the magicians reality—and the one the spectators perceive—\nthe spectators reality. The magician’s reality consists of all the sleights of hand and manipulation of gimmicked devices\nthat make up the prosaic reality of magic. The spectator’s reality, given a sufficiently competent magician, is entirely\ndifferent: an alternate reality in which the normal laws of nature are repeatedly defied, a reality where the magician, as\nwell as his or her tricks, appears supernatural.”\nTognazzini goes on to quote Henning Nelms to show the way that these realities are represented in the magician’s mind.\n“All of the most successful showman-conjurers agree that you must believe in your own magic; you cannot hope to\nconvince an audience unless you first convince yourself.”22\nSecond-order cyberneticians (including biologists such as Humberto Mantura and Francisco Varela) have created\nmassively powerful understandings of nature—and human cognition as part of nature. They are all, in one way or\nanother, interested in circular descriptions, which fold in on themselves. Stage magic is an example of an interaction\nthat can only be understood by treating the relationship between magician and audience as circular, continually iterated\nover time during the performance. But what happens if the magician is not there and all that is left is a set or a stage?\nTognazzini’s electronic interfaces are like this; the user interfaces to the architectures that support design in the physical\nworld could be considered in the same way.\n“The magician’s tools should be disguised to look like objects in the real world, if these are common things, objects with\nwhich the spectator is familiar, this spectator will accept them in terms as he knows them.”23\nMagicians and interface designers have no problem with the idea that a “real world” exists “out there,” from which\nmetaphors can be drawn that will convince their audiences. Designers and architects might be uncomfortable with this\nopportunistic notion. Their discomfort would be natural because they construct the “real world” from which many of\nthe metaphors are drawn and, in principle, can change it if they wish. This is where the parallels between stage magic\nand architecture are closer than those between stage magic and interface design as understood by Tognazzini. The\ninterface designer seeks to construct a stable “reality” using whatever means are available. The magician uses “real\nworld” metaphors to create the illusion that the audience’s understandings of the “real world” do not apply. The magician\nconstructs a new, albeit temporary, reality that destabilizes the old. A new physical environment is a new, possibly longterm reality that frequently replaces the old.\nTognazzini has abstracted a range of tools that might be useful in physical architecture and design. All the tools go to\nmaking a construct of the observer for the magician and the electronic interface designer that is far more sophisticated\nthan any of the trivializations of “the user” the architectural profession currently employs. The question of whether and\nwhere these representations could be regarded as representations of potentially non-trivial machines will be examined\nin a future paper.\n\n48\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nConstructing the User\nAn architecture of possibilities\nOne can conclude that constructs of human behaviors with appropriate supporting physical artifacts will establish an\narchitecture of commodity. Is this the whole story? Perhaps architecture goes beyond this. Computer hardware and\nsoftware engineers think so. They have appropriated the term “architecture” for their own uses, and in all cases, the\nterm is used to describe the structure of something that can contain a particular program, together with a lot of other\nsimilar programs.\nTom Demarco differentiates “architecture” from “design.”24 He describes architecture as a framework for the disciplined\nintroduction of change. He also describes “architecture” as applying to a family of products, while “design” applies to a\nsingle product. Tom Demarco is a software engineer writing from the perspective of someone who wishes to create a\ndurable and useful product—and from a standpoint that architecture that lasts for fifteen years is extraordinarily durable.\nBuildings and cityscapes typically last for fifty years. Some are still in use after two thousand years. It is well known that\nmost buildings start to be altered and reconfigured from the moment they are built.25\nFigure 1 Teatro\nOlimpico showing\nfixed set\n\nThe conundrum of commodity in this context is that many spaces in the built environment\nwill probably, over their lifetime, contain a range of different activities that are, in themselves,\npart of larger, precise short-term constructs that can be framed and are analogous to play.\nFrank Duffy and John Worthington26 took the theatrical analogy to develop an approach\nto office design that differentiated the building from the “set” inside it, ascribing different\nlife spans to each. The “set” is the local partition layout and the associated doors and\ninternal finishes. “Furniture” in the “set” can be modified to provide an even faster change in\nresponse to changes in day-to-day company procedures. The “furniture” and the “set” are\nthe physical aspects of “framing” as described by Bateson.\nMoving and replacing partitions and local finishes can be very expensive and disruptive.27\nJohn Weeks put forward an alternative strategy,28 which he calls the “long life loose fit,”\nreferring to the creative use of redundancy.29 In this approach, spaces are large enough to contain generic human\nactivities, rather than small enough to contain particular human activities.\n\nPalaces\nThe idea of a generic architecture means that the specific environmental support for groups of framed behaviors must\nexist either in the “set” or in the “furniture.” Fred Scott30 and Bob Evans31 convincingly argued that the palaces of the\nRenaissance adopted the latter. They suggested that the absence of corridors in these buildings meant that it would\nnot be possible to convincingly attribute invariant functions to particular rooms, and that any functionality that existed lay\nwith the occupants and their assorted pieces of loose furniture at any one time.\nThe palaces of the Renaissance are full of frescos, decorated ceilings, colonnades, and wonderful, permanent floor\nfinishes. In these palaces, the generic spatial description is complete. The palace is the antithesis of the contemporary\noffice block. Something is being framed in the palace that goes beyond any particular framed set of activities within it.\nIs the palace a form of generic stage, like the fixed set in Palladio’s Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza? The theatrical analogy\nonly works in this case if one envisages a theatre without blackout, one that uses daylight for illumination, where furniture\nand local setting are as visible as the surrounding enclosure.\nTom Demarco’s distinction between design and architecture appears to hold in the built environment. Design is\ncontained by architecture and has different attributes. Specific user behavior is very closely constructed in design and is\nmuch more indeterminate in architecture. When these constructs are made through a top-down process, the architect\nand the designer can be the same person operating in different modes, or these roles can be split. A good example of\nan architect who operated in both capacities in the seventeenth century is British architect Inigo Jones. More than half\nhis work involved creating the sets and costumes for the masques performed by the court of King Charles I.32 These\nmasques can be considered extreme constructs of great specificity.33 A more recent architect who has operated as\na designer in this way is Mark Fisher; he has exclusively worked on staging major events, such as the Rolling Stones\nworld tours, throughout his career.\nThe concept of “use” is much more difficult to grasp in architecture than in design because the user is much more\nelusive. It may be more appropriate in this context to readdress Wooton’s notion of commodity, if for no other reason\nthan because Wooton was writing at a period when the palaces that Evans and Scott describe were being replicated\nacross the UK for wealthy clients. Wooton was a Latin scholar and a master of rhetoric. His “commodity” can be taken\nto be the Latin “Utilitas,” a word that is not easy to translate into modern English. It is sometimes translated as “utility” but\ncan also be understood as “expediency” or “advantage.” Cicero uses it in the context of “communis utilitas,” which can\nbe translated as the common good, or common expediency, or common advantage. He describes it as an attribute\nof the body politic or of external things, and includes among the latter fields, ports and other things that go beyond\nnecessity, such as the spaciousness and uncommon ornamentation of a city.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n49\n\nConstructing the User\nFollowing Cicero’s terms, we must reconstruct the user of a piece of architecture as a generality, a “body politic” whose\nappreciation goes beyond immediate necessity. The architecture must also be expedient and give advantage. Can this\nbe pinned down in the twenty-first century?\nWooton’s “body politic” was the oligarchy that ruled Britain in the early seventeenth century, a very small section of the\noverall population; he probably knew most of it either directly or through his family and friends. Today’s body politic is\nassumed as the whole population. However, the number of people who have direct control over significant spending\non the environment and on major building projects is probably little different, as a proportion of the population to the\nseventeenth-century figure. These people, the commercial and public clients, developers, project managers, and their\narchitects, are the “creators of” the theatres of everyday life in the twenty-first century.\nAlthough it is possible to use this argument to examine critically contemporary urbanism, it is probably more fruitful to\nuse it to examine buildings, groups of buildings, and semi-private landscapes. The contemporary city as a physical\nentity is often hopelessly compromised by current modes of transport and communication that, on the one hand,\ndestroy its homogeneity and, on the other, make it less and less relevant. The city as a whole is perceived to offer very\nlittle in the way of “communis utilitas” to many of the “creators of” the buildings within it. Private and semi-private space\nis a different matter. There are often very strong political and economic pressures that drive the “creators of” these\nenvironments. The aim is to ensure that the “observers in” these environments find them of value.\nThe spatial organization and the aesthetic qualities of the surrounding enclosures in the palace (or any contemporary\nversion of the palace) could be considered a form of metasystem that “contains” the specific “performances” that occur\nwithin it. If so, it is a very strange form of metasystem, far distant from the “Metasystem Transition” proposed by Valentin\nTurchin.34 Turchin’s Metasystem is an evolutionary construct where higher levels of control emerge in system structure\nand function through a “bottom-up” process.\nPerhaps “metasystem” is the wrong term for John Weeks’ “loose-fit” building or a Renaissance palace. In a modification\nto Ross Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety, it was suggested that variety is reduced in control systems by a process\ncalled “buffering,” which exists independently of the control function in the system. It is appropriate to consider many\nhuman interventions in the physical environment as physical buffers that ensure stability in the face of disturbance.\nRanulph Glanville gives the example of reservoirs that accommodate changes in rainfall and the “slack” space that\narchitect Cedric Price incorporated into his buildings.35 Both the palace and the loose-fit hospital contain buffer spaces\nin the form of generously sized rooms, wide internal “streets,” and internal courtyards.\nOne can also view the construction of physical walls and edges as a way of reducing variety in occupant behavior.\nThe distinction between the frame that forms part of moment-to-moment behavior and the environment that supports\na range of behaviors allows us, with caution, to consider the latter to be analogous to a channel of communication of\na finite and particular capacity, with a particular functional “frame” being analogous to a message. Noise in the channel\ncan be taken to be the distortion that the environment places on moment-to-moment behaviors. A hypothetical example\nof this is an environment consisting entirely of long, thin rooms. Consider a group of people trying to hold a round-table\ndiscussion in such a place. The long, thin rooms will necessitate a long, thin table, and conversations will fragment\nalong it, except when the meeting is formally addressed from a particular point.\nIt is possible to describe buffers, walls, and edges as constraints that reduce variety, while still permitting the\nintroduction of change. The resulting environment can be considered a terrain on which temporary local systems\ndevelop and evolve. As such, it resembles the “terrain” that is described by Valentino Braitenberg in his bok, Vehicles,36\nand some of the “patches” that exist in a “Star Logo” environment. The users of this terrain are people, performing\ncomplex framed behaviors and bringing their own furniture and tools to support these behaviors.\nThe nature of this terrain poses significant questions for the architect if it is to be directly experienced by the users, if\nit is to be more than a shell. An inference from the communication analogy is to suggest that such spaces should be\nas bland as possible while they await the furniture that will frame a day-to-day event, so that the “noise” in the building\nis kept to a minimum. The problem with this approach is that the furniture is often also bland. The resulting spaces\nfrequently offer the observer very little in the way of visual stimulus. This comment especially applies to the main\ncirculation and waiting areas in large public buildings and the external spaces outside of them. These spaces could offer\nvariety in Pask’s terms, forming part of a second-order cybernetic system when reconstructed by their observers. The\nvisual cues to be read in this way may well be embedded in surface illusions and spatial sequences, vital to the Utilitas\nof the place, rather than being an expression of its functionality.\n\nConclusion\nIt is likely that the concept of Utilitas that Sir Henry Wooton translated as commodity described a building\nattribute other than direct functionality. It is probable that this quality allows for the orderly introduction of\nchange on a day-to-day basis by reducing variety. The resulting buildings can also offer the observer a\nseparate investigation into each building’s aesthetic qualities without prejudicing its long-term performance.\n\n50\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nConstructing the User\nEndnotes\n1\n\nGAGE, S (2006). “THE WONDER OF TRIVIAL MACHINES.” IN SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE (IN PRINT).

Sabin\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nFigure 1 Networking\nSimulation 3, Jenny\nE. Sabin, 2008\n\nRecent technological leaps in data production and computation have afforded both architects and scientists an\nextraordinary ability to generate information and complex form. Rather than deal in the composition of wholes, architects\nspecializing in generative and parametric design strategies—more formally known as design computation—have\nadopted a bottom-up approach to the negotiation of constraints within the design process (fig. 1). This renewed\ninterest in complexity has offered alternative methods for investigating the interrelationships of parts to their wholes, and\nemergent self-organized pattern systems at multiple scales and applications. The contemporary architecture avantgarde has provided many examples that showcase the proven power such digital tools afford the designer, inspiring\nand leading to the generation of beautiful form. But what are our next steps in addressing complexity? How should\narchitects with expertise in design computation situate themselves in larger design dialogues concerning pressing\ntopics such as those concerning our environment?\nThere is the potential, for example, to harness these skills and techniques to address such global issues through a\nbottom-up, systems-based approach to design ecology. This endeavor demands a closer look at the formal interplay\nbetween code and context. Biology provides useful systems-based models for architects to study to understand how\ncontext specifies form, function, and structure. While the end goals may differ in science and architecture, there is a\ndriving necessity in both disciplines to spatialize, model, and fabricate complex, emergent, and self-organized systems.\nHow do we intuit, see, and inhabit complex wholes that are indiscernible from their parts? Intersections between\ncomputation and material organizations reveal powerful models for visualizing and perceiving the intangible. Information\ngains meaning through multiple modes of expression. This desire to inhabit these realms may be driven by a deeper\nneed to locate ourselves within this daunting terrain of digital processes, including formal, ecological, and sustainable\nmodels. Here, form is the product of the interaction of contextual events and code over time and in space. This dynamic\ninterplay between code and context enables the production of performative and changeable architecture at multiplelength scales and oscillatory states.\n\n52\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nCode, Context, and Perception: Matrix Architecture and\nthe Architect Weaver\nThe evolution of digital media has prompted new techniques of fabrication as well as new understandings in the\norganization of material through its properties and potential for assemblage. The scope of much of this experimental\ndesign work and research probes the relationship between code and pattern, material and geometry, fabrication\nand assembly. The following projects integrate these relationships with contextual constraints. These are frequently\ndriven by diverse datasets arising from intersections found between science and architecture. The bringing together\nof code with context, through the study of natural systems and biological models, provides insight into relationships\nbetween form, behavior, and environment. Through transformations in geometry, form, and materials over time and in\nspace, design models are found at varying scales, from that of cells to woven geometries and products to structures\nand forms and, finally, to building. Natural models—and, more specifically, those found in biology—offer the architect\na new way of considering design ecology. The combined architectural result depends upon the visualization of\ncomplex datasets through the generation and design of computational tools. Material, geometry, and environment\nare not separate from each other but, rather, share reciprocal and, therefore, ecological relationships through a\ncomprehensive modeling of inputs and outputs.\nBeyond form and code or even mathematical models, this work considers contextual constraints such as site, program,\nand human occupation integral in the development of generative design tools and the overall scripted process. Here,\ncode is altered, mutated, and informed by context, thus, generating not just form, but also architectural purpose and\nintent. In some of the listed projects, the vehicle for translation is found through material constructs and simulations\nthat recapitulate the power of biological phenomena into different formal data constructs, while preserving essential\nrelationships through scalable leaps into architectural contexts (see Branching Morphogenesis, figs. 2–7).\n\nFigure 2–7 Branching\nMorphogenesis, Jenny\nE. Sabin & Andrew\nLucia with Peter Lloyd\nJones and Annette\nFierro, 2008\n\nLooking to nature for design inspiration is not a new idea, but perhaps, the way that we “see” is. Architects and\nstructural engineers, for example, have historically turned to natural models to design and build better shell and\nmembrane structures. Cable nets have been inspired by the high strength-to-weight ratio of the spider web, as\nhave pneumatic structures after Frei Otto’s well-known soap bubble experiments, or vaults after shells and eggs\ncomposed of hard and curved materials, as well as geodesic domes after single-celled aquatic radiolarian. The\nstructural designer Robert Le Ricolais studied the tension networks inherent to radiolarian in order to understand\nthe dynamic properties and qualities of closed and open “skeletal” structures. Le Ricolais professed that he had\n“found no better discipline in this unpredictable problem of form than to observe the prodigies created by nature.”\nLe Corbusier also looked to nature to inform his well-known proportional building system, called the “Modulor.” Le\nCorbusier stated, “In Nature, the smallest cell determines the validity, the health, of the whole.”1 Corbusier sought to\nstandardize and rationalize space, and the order found in nature informed many of his ideas.2 He was intrigued by\nthe architecture of the homes of ants and honeybees and he referred to the biology of the city.3 He spoke of “Radiant\nArchitecture,” an architecture that would impose its influence upon its surroundings, and would be made radiant\nthrough the Modulor. This was an applied (not generative) but rule-based system Corbusier designed. In order\nto scale up or scale down units, the Fibonacci sequence\nwas used to generate infinitely large or small dimensions.\nAs a numerical algorithm whose qualities and properties\nare found in nature, the Modulor was a tool to modulate\nand arrange dimensional relationships to each other. One\nmay even call it a very early example of a parametric and\nassociative model.\nContemporary design tools have also made the generation\nof complex patterns and forms accessible to architects.\nConcurrently, the sophistication of our design tools provides\nmethods and means for seeing and modeling natural\nsystems. Consequently, designing through complexity to\nachieve coherent results demands an ever-closer look at\ntruly dynamic systems and a return to the study of natural\nmodels. Organic models such as those found in nature\noffer up modes for understanding issues of feedback,\nadaptation, growth, and self-assembly, as they negotiate\ntruly dynamic environments. A rigorous understanding\nand analysis of these types of models will allow architects\nto retool and reevaluate how we negotiate topics such\nas complexity, emergence, and self-organization in\narchitecture. It is not possible to translate directly these\nmicro-scale examples to macro-scale applications, as\nthere is no logical linear and scalable jump in geometry\nand material make-up from the micro to the macro. Rather\nthan mimic or directly translate these scientific models to\nthe human built scale and vice versa, this type of research\nrequires a break from perceived pedagogical boundaries,\nthus, giving rise to new modes of thinking and working in\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n53\n\nCode, Context, and Perception: Matrix Architecture and\nthe Architect Weaver\ndesign and science. It is through this immersion that our design tools may become more flexible by engaging a\nthorough assessment of truly complex and emergent systems.\n\nMatrix Architecture: Code in Context\n\nFigure 8\nnetworking simulation,\nChristopher Lee and\nAndrew Lucia, 2008\n\nThis immersion within trans-disciplinary work found at the interface between\narchitecture, computation, and science was initiated and further fostered through\nthe Nonlinear Systems Organization (NSO), a research arm at PennDesign\nfounded by the visionary structural engineer, Cecil Balmond. This interface has\nbeen substantially bolstered by a 4-year strong collaboration with Dr. Peter Lloyd\nJones, Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine based at the Institute for\nMedicine and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. Within the context\nof this collaboration, we have co-founded a hybrid architectural-biological\nresearch and design unit, the Sabin+Jones LabStudio; therein, we are primarily\ninterested in architectural models and design tools that emerge through the\nstudy of cells and tissues within tissue-specific, dynamic, extracellular matrix\nenvironments. More specifically, we are observing how micro-environmental\narchitectures, at the level of the matrix, control cell behavior at the geometric,\nbiochemical, and biophysical levels. The matrix environment is a cell-derived,\nwoven and globular protein network that contacts most cells within the body—\nan architectural textile of sorts. Importantly, as I have come to learn from my\ncollaboration with the Jones laboratory, this environment changes dynamically\nthroughout development and disease; we are specifically interested in models\nthat show how these alterations feed back to control cell and tissue behavior at\nthe level of code and beyond, in multiple dimensions including time.\nThis exchange of information between the inside of the cell and its exterior\nenvironment presents a potent architectural model for understanding how context\nor environment shares a reciprocal relationship with code, geometry, and matter.\nMatrix Architecture, a term that we have coined, features formal and material\nattributes that are based upon interdependent relationships between environment\nand code. In one project, we have developed advanced imaging and scripting\nprocedures to generate new forms and structural organizations within architectural\ndesign. This project (figs 2–7), titled “Branching Morphogenesis” (design by Jenny\nE. Sabin and Andrew Lucia with Peter Lloyd Jones and Annette Fierro), investigates\npart-to-whole relationships that are revealed during the generation of branched\nstructures, which are formed in real-time by interacting lung endothelial cells4 placed\nwithin a 3D gelatinous and fibrous matrix in vitro. The study and quantification of\nthis network allow for a greater understanding of how variable components might\ngive rise to structured networks in both biology and architecture. The “Branching\nMorphogenesis” installation, originally installed in the Design and Computation\nGalleries at Siggraph 2008 and now currently on exhibit at Ars Electronica in Linz,\nAustria, materializes five slices in real time to capture the predicted force network\nthat interacting endothelial cells exert upon the neighboring matrix. The time lapses\nmanifest as five vertical, interconnected layers made from over 75,000 cable zip\nties. Gallery visitors are invited to walk around and in between the layers and to\nimmerse themselves within an organic and newly created “Datascape.” The\ndynamic matrix change fuses with the perceiving body through human occupation,\nall through the constraints of a ready-made.\nMany student design projects have also applied the ideas set forth by the Sabin\nand Jones LabStudio collaboration, as well as those explored within the context\nof our co-taught research elective at PennDesign titled Nonlinear Systems\nBiology & Design. Elective courses and design studios have further developed\nthese principles. For example, students Misako Murata and Christopher Lee\napplied generative tools and simulations developed in Nonlinear Systems\nBiology and Design to a design project calling for a public pavilion and student bookstore on the Schuylkill River\nwaterfront in Philadelphia, PA. This second investigation took place in an advanced research studio co-taught by\nCecil Balmond and myself. The students observed the networking behavior of lung cells in both normal and diseased\ncontexts (fig. 8). In addition, the students were investigating how internal cellular mechanics, as a response to\nthe matrix, may inspire the novel design of deployable systems and structures (fig. 9). Here, the algorithmic and\ndigital exploration of relationships between interacting cells and their immediate tissue environment gives rise to an\nabstract, yet deeper understanding of architectural form as it relates to a dynamic boundary condition. The students\nused the tools and simulations designed to track and model these behaviors through time and in space in scalable\narchitectural contexts for the final pavilion design. No longer working with cells, the students replaced what were\n\n54\n\nFigure 9 deployable\nstudy model informed\nby cellular mechanics,\nas response to matrix\nenvironment, Misako\nMurata, 2008\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nCode, Context, and Perception: Matrix Architecture and\nthe Architect Weaver\n\nFigure 10–14 Final\nPavilion Design—The\ndeployable systems,\nearlier informed and\nprogrammed by the\ninner workings of\ncellular morphology,\nnow respond, adapt\nand grow in concert\nwith their existing\nenvironment, the\nUPenn campus\nwaterfront along\nthe Schuylkill River\nin Philadelphia.\nMisako Murata and\nChristopher Lee, 2008\n\nonce micro-scale parameters with macro-scale site-based constraints such as existing bridge and road networks\nand fluctuating car, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic patterns (figs. 10, 11). The deployable systems that, earlier, the\ninner workings of cellular morphology informed and programmed, now respond, adapt, and grow in concert with\ntheir existing environment, the UPenn campus waterfront along the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia (figs. 12–14). For\nexample, existing constraints governed by bridge and campus infrastructure inform and alter the overall programming\nof the deployable pavilion. Additionally, seasonal events sparked by local campus programming, infuse the pavilion\ndesign with variegated structural and spatial behavior in response to user need.\n\nCode, Context, and Perception\nThe international SmartGeometry Group has also served as a testing bed for several of the design ideas explained\nabove. In one project by student Devin Jernigan, for example, he addresses the topic of waste with generative\ndesign strategies in networking models (figs. 15, 16). Jernigan’s project represents a network of U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency dirty waste points in New York City. The points themselves represent a diverse network of different\ntypes of waste: sewage, hazardous waste, and air emissions. These hazardous waste points are then activated as\nsensors for the city to determine highest density regions in the city. These regions are then equipped with cleansing\n“seed” towers that are able to precisely store, clean, and redistribute the waste material, acting as a local ecological\ncontact within the city. This geometrical model is based specifically on self-justifying point sets that will create their\nown sub-networks specific to individual “seed” locations (fig. 17). In moving forward with this project, Jernigan hopes\nto produce analytical data systems, which will program and influence the design of the “seed” towers.\nLike Jernigan’s project, the notion of constantly recombining architecture in response to contextual circumstances\nis perhaps best visualized in architecture through Cedric Price’s architectural proposals of the early 1960’s. Price\nsets forth an initial coded hardware or component that is then exposed to unlimited variation through circumstances\nexternal to the actual building units. As Arata Isozaki comments on Price’s Fun Palace project in his essay titled Erasing\nArchitecture into the System, “Fun Palace would change its entire appearance as performance spaces moved about\nand contents shifted. The important thing was that there no longer was any strict time or space composed by the\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n55\n\nCode, Context, and Perception: Matrix Architecture and\nthe Architect Weaver\n\nartist but, rather, mechanical systems reconfiguring in every possible way in response to circumstances.” Isozaki\ncontinues by stating that this may even be called anonymous design. Here, Price gives us a minimal selection\nof networked units that may reconfigure into architectural elements (screens, light poles, inflatables, frames, and\nsunblinds) based on users’ requests, programmatic need, environmental factors such as weather, or just plain fun.\nFun, in this sense, is generated by improbable events elicited by the uncertain chance of hardware (component\nnetworks) recombining and responding to human occupation and play. Code and context form a reciprocal loop\nwhere the newly created by-product is architecture of excess and unpredicted activity. Our own perceptive prowess\nnow enters the mix.\n\nFigure 15–17 WASTE\n– networking strategies\nto address the topic of\nwaste in NYC – Devin\nJernigan with Smart\nGeometry senior tutor,\nJenny E. Sabin, 2009\n\nThe possibility of bringing biomaterial behavior into tangible architectural constructs presents new models for\narchitecture. These models express how context-driven form is, substantially, the result of a complex interaction\nof code with contextual events and/or constraints. This format challenges our contemporary understanding of\ndigital and generative design through rigorous collaborations with scientists and a return to the study of nature. In\nturn, it calls for greater responsibility and agency on the part of the architect. Given today’s suite of environmental\nand economic issues, architects working in design computation should expose themselves to larger questions\nsurrounding the topic of complexity. We need to address issues of performance, feedback, and ecological building\nin new ways, alongside those of human experience, occupation, and perception, among others. As was presented\nin the project “Branching Morphogenesis” (figs. 2–7), geometry and code alone do not complete an architectural\nand spatial proposal. It is the insertion of the human body, and of perception coupled with code and context, that\nworks to create a generative interface, a perceiving and sensing architecture, one that is fleeting and boundless, and\nconstantly being woven and unraveled by radical codes, relentless environments, and perceiving bodies.\n\n56\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nCode, Context, and Perception: Matrix Architecture and\nthe Architect Weaver\nDesign ecology, therefore, is a product of reciprocity, where code, pattern, geometry, material, issues of fabrication,\nand, especially, the body in its environment are inextricably linked. This reciprocity situates our roles (researcher,\narchitect, teacher/student) at the interface between environment and entity at multiple-length scales and oscillatory\nstates. The once daunting terrain of digital and generative processes may challenge and afford us not only beautiful\nform, but also informed form.\n\nConclusion: The Architect Weaver\nThe exploratory and experimental architecture described here demands collaboration and requires participation\nin two-way dialogues. It favors process-driven research over goal-driven research. Its vitality is dependent upon\nintuition or knowing where to look along the way. This clarity comes forth from doing, making, collaborating, and\nfailing. ”Knowing where to look” requires a constant refinement of one’s intuition.\nThere are no fields in this artful and scientific pursuit; rather, it undulates within a multi-set of refined intuitions.\nIt embraces, teaches, and explores abstract concepts that reflect across and over perceived pedagogical and\ndisciplinary boundaries. Spikes along this continuum articulate discovery and new ways of seeing. It is neither about\nbreaking down walls nor sampling across, but rather is about continuity and connectedness. Specificity, specialty,\nand subjectivity are in the “seeing.”\nIn this act of “seeing,” the architect designs through a space of connectedness. This space is an unfolding body that\ndraws itself from an undulating matrix of data rich in qualities. It is more than just sampling bits. As opposed to connecting\nthe dots, the architect intuits the next, the prior, and the adjacent simultaneously. The architect is a conceptual weaver\nworking backwards, forwards, and across linked data sets. Here, loose-loop and tight-loop configurations give rise to\nnew rhythms, new effects, and perhaps, new visions for an adaptive and performative architecture.\nThe generosity of this collective creative force draws itself from the undulating plane at a distance, which takes in\nall past, present, and future collaborative acts. We might call these momentary acts of disturbance “fray.” Intuition\nenables the architect-weaver to locate zones of fray within the undulating plane, where geometric figures, matter,\nand form reside.\nHistorically, the visionary and short-lived Black Mountain College of the late 1940s and early 50s occupied one such\nconceptual zone of fray. Here, designers, artists, choreographers, structural engineers, and musicians gathered\nto push forward new techniques and proposals in design and the arts. Bucky Fuller’s failed attempts at his first\ngeodesic domes gave rise to new questions and new ideas on tensegrity structures. Simultaneously, the artists\nand Black Mountain College instructors Anni and Josef Albers introduced a concept that they called Meander. They\nused this concept to teach a bottom-up approach to pattern generation and simple mathematical relationships to\ndescribe parts in relationship to their compiled wholes. Such abstract concepts reflected across and over perceived\npedagogical boundaries gave rise to new ideas in design and the arts. Perhaps we are in our own Meander, this time\nembracing established disciplines in a collaborative environment devoid of boundaries, sifted through, compiled, and\nwoven by architect-weavers.\nCode in context informs the weaving of structure and space to generate a boundless and undulating architectural\nfabric. Intuition offers the on/off nature of the weave a fourth dimension. Systemic oscillations undulate along the\nconceptual fabric, and the pattern responds. Architecture resides within the events elicited by the undulating and\ninterlacing conceptual threads. In loose-loop and tight-loop configurations, an event emerges from chaos. The\narchitect-weaver engages a space that is about working across disciplines, where collaborative design drives new\nvisions in structural and intensive flows. What is even more potent, however, is the conceptual space these linkages\noffer. The fabricated result may always exist within metric space, but the process itself engages a smooth space that\nundulates and moves horizontally as it searches for optimal applications, either material or digital, within a coded and\ncontextual logic. What lies immanent finds meaning and material through a filtered space, a woven space that holds\nthe residual tracings of code, context, and perception.\n\nEndnotes\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nFLORA SAMUEL, LE CORBUSIER IN DETAIL (OXFORD: ARCHITECTURAL PRESS, 2007), P. 1.\nIBID., PP. 15–16.\nIBID., P. 16.\nENDOTHELIAL CELLS LINE THE INTERIOR SURFACE OF ALL BLOOD VESSELS, FORMING AN INTERFACE BETWEEN CIRCULATING\nBLOOD IN THE LUMEN AND THE REST OF THE VESSEL WALL.

It surveys significant past and current projects that deal with interactive,\nresponsive environments. The principal argument is that change in architecture is far from being adequately addressed\nor explored theoretically, experimentally, or phenomenologically.\n\nTOWARDS PSYCHOTROPIC AND EMOTIVE HOUSES\n“It was a beautiful room all right, with opaque plastex walls and white fluo-glass ceiling, but something terrible had\nhappened there. As it responded to me, the ceiling lifting slightly and the walls growing less opaque, reflecting my\nperspective-seeking eye, I noticed that curious mottled knots were forming, indicating where the room had been\nstrained and healed faultily. Deep hidden rifts began to distort the sphere, ballooning out one of the alcoves like a\nbubble of overextended gum.” —J.G. Ballard, The Thousand Dreams of Bellavista\nJames Graham Ballard,1 the British novelist, describes in his short story “The Thousand Dreams of Stellavista,” a\n“psychotropic house,” a machine-like, mood-sensitive house that responds to and learns from its occupants. The\nimagined sci-fi house is made from a material Ballard referred to as “plastex,” a combination of plaster and latex that\nallows the house to change its shape as needed. Furthermore, the house features, distributed over it, many “sensocells,” which are capable of “echoing every shift of mood and position of its occupants, such that living in one was like\ninhabiting someone else’s brain.”\nWhile Ballard’s “psychotropic house” belongs to science fiction, the “E-motive House” by Kas Oosterhuis2 edges closer\nto contemporary technological and material reality. Oosterhuis describes a responsive, interactive house that can\ndevelop its own emotions, “a house with a character of its own, sometimes unyielding, sometimes flexible, at one time\nsexy, at another unpredictable, stiff and unfeeling.” The goal is to create an “emotional relationship between the house,\nits occupiers and the elements.” The E-motive House can be a “reactor” as well as an “actor,” where the “acting will be\nmade possible by a cooperative swarm of actuators like pneumatic beams, contracting muscles and hydraulic cylinders.”\nThe house is also capable of reacting: “The movement of the users and the changes in the weather are registered by\na diversity of sensors, and are translated by the brain of the house into an action.” In this way, the inhabitants and the\nactuators of the house will develop a common language so that they can communicate with each other.\nIn 2003, Oosterhuis and his Hyperbody research group designed and constructed the Muscle, a working prototype of\na programmable building that can reconfigure itself “mentally and physically.” The Muscle is a pressurized soft volume,\nwrapped in a mesh of tensile Festo “muscles,” which can change their own length and, thus, the overall shape of the\nprototype. The public connects to the prototype by sensors and quickly learns how the Muscle reacts to their actions;\nthe Muscle, however, is programmed to have a will of its own, making the outcomes of interactions unpredictable. The\nultimate goal of the project is to “develop an individual character for the Muscle.” The Muscle has demonstrated that\nthe E-motive House is not so techno-utopian—and that Ballard’s “psychotropic” house could perhaps become a reality\nof our inhabitation in the future.\n\n58\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nExploring Architecture of Change\nTOWARDS ARCHITECTURE THAT IS ADAPTIVE, FLEXIBLE, INTERACTIVE,\nRESPONSIVE...\nA common thread that runs through Ballard’s “psychotropic house” and Oosterhuis’s E-motive House is a vision of an\narchitecture in which buildings can change their shape, their form, the configuration and appearance of space, and environmental\nconditions—on the fly—in response to patterns of occupation and contextual conditions (and shape those, in return, too).\nBuildings will become adaptive, interactive, reflexive, responsive...\nAs the external socio-economic, cultural, and technological context changes, so do conceptions of space, shape, and form\nin architecture. Over the past decade, we have seen an increasing interest in exploring the capacity of built spaces to change\n(i.e., to respond dynamically to changes in the external and internal environments and to different patterns of use). Oosterhuis’s\nMuscle is just one of many experimental projects that have been completed. The principal idea is that two-way relationships\ncould be established among the spaces, the environment, and the users: the users or the changes in the environment would\naffect the configuration of space and vice versa; the result is an architecture that self-adjusts to the needs of the users.\nThe first concepts of an adaptive, responsive architecture where born in the late 1960s and early 1970s, primarily as a result\nof parallel developments in cybernetics, artificial intelligence, and information technologies, in general, and as a response to\narchitecture’s rigid, inflexible articulation of space and its configuration.\nGordon Pask set the foundations for interactive environments in the 1960s; he was one of the early proponents of cybernetics in\narchitecture, whose concept of Conversation Theory,3 as a comprehensive theory of interaction, is particularly applicable today\nas various attempts are made to create constructive relationships between humans and machines (as in interactive architecture).\nPask’s ideas had a tremendous influence on both Cedric Price and Nicholas Negroponte, whose pioneering work in the 1960s\ncontinues to inspire; Pask worked with both Price and Negroponte.\nCedric Price was the first to adopt concepts from cybernetics and use them to articulate a concept of “anticipatory architecture,”\nmanifested in his Fun Palace and Generator projects. Nicholas Negroponte was among the first to propose in the late 1960s\nthat computing power be integrated into buildings so that they could perform better. In his book Soft Architecture Machines,4 he\nmoved beyond the “architecture machines” that would help architects design buildings and proposed that buildings could be\n“‘assisted,’ ‘augmented,’ and eventually ‘replicated’ by a computer.” The ambition was to “consider the physical environment as\nan evolving mechanism.” In the last chapter, he made a prediction that “architecture machines” (in the distant future) “won’t help\nus design; instead, we will live in them,” echoing the sci-fi “psychotropic houses” of J.G. Ballard.\nAt roughly the same time that Negroponte was working on his “architecture machines,” Charles Eastman5 developed the\nconcept of “adaptive-conditional architecture,” which self-adjusts based on the feedback from the spaces and users. Eastman\nproposed that automated systems could control buildings’ responses. He used an analogy of a thermostat to describe the\nessential components: sensors that would register changes in the environment, control mechanisms (or algorithms) that would\ninterpret sensor readings, actuators as devices that would produce changes in the environment, and a device (an interface)\nthat would let users enter their preferences. That is roughly the component makeup of any reactive system developed to date.\nJean Nouvel’s Institut du Monde Arabe, completed in 1989 in Paris, was the first significant, large-scale building to have an\nadaptive envelope. The building’s kinetic curtain wall, a technological interpretation in glass and steel of a traditional Arab lattice\nscreen, is composed of some 30,000 photosensitive diaphragms that control light levels and transparency in response to the\nsun’s location (the system no longer works due to mechanical problems). Hoberman Associates (led by Chuck Hoberman) is\nperhaps one of the best-known contemporary practices to have designed several kinetic, performance-based adaptive shading\nsystems for building projects by firms such as Foster and Partners and Nikken Sekkei. More and more designers and firms are\nbeginning to experiment with innovative sensing, control, and actuation technologies to create kinetic, adaptive performancebased systems.\n\nTOWARDS PASKIAN RESPONSIVE ENVIRONMENTS\nThe primary goal of constructing a truly responsive, adaptive architecture is to imbue buildings with the capacity to interact\nwith the environment and their users. Architecture that echoes the work of Nicholas Negroponte could be understood as an\nadaptive, responsive machine—a sensory, actuated, performative assemblage of spatial and technical systems that creates an\nenvironment that stimulates and is, in turn, stimulated by users’ interactions and their behavior. Arguably, for any such system\nto be continually engaging, it has to be designed as inherently indeterminate in order to produce unpredictable outcomes. The\nuser should have an effect on the system’s behavior or its outcome and, more importantly, on how that behavior or outcome is\ncomputed. That requires that both inputs and outputs of the systems be constructed on the fly. It is this capacity to construct\ninputs and outputs that distinguishes interactive from merely reactive systems.\nThe distinction between interactive and reactive is what enables adaptive, responsive architecture to be seen as an enabler\nof new relations between people and spaces. When Philip Beesley and his colleagues describe a responsive environment in\nResponsive Architectures: Subtle Technologies6 as a “networked structure that senses action within a field of attention and\nresponds dynamically with programmed and designed logic,” they are referring to what is essentially a reactive system. In\ncontrast, Michael Fox and Miles Kemp7 argue that in “interactive” architecture, the interaction is circular—systems “interact”\ninstead of just “react.” The distinction between interaction and reaction (i.e., a system’s response) is not clear-cut, because\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n59\n\nExploring Architecture of Change\na dynamic action of a component, for example, could be seen not simply as a reaction but also part of the overall scenarios\nof interactivity. Tristan D’Estree Sterk8 distinguishes direct manipulation (deliberate control), automation (reflexive control), and\nhybridized models as forms of interaction between the users and the technologies behind responsive systems. For Sterk,\n“the hybridized model can also be used to produce responses that have adjustable response criteria, achieving this by using\noccupant interactions to build contextual models of the ways in which users occupy and manipulate space.”\nAs Usman Haque9 puts it, the goal is “a model of interaction where an individual can directly adjust the way that a machine\nresponds to him or her so that they can converge on a mutually agreeable nature of feedback: an architecture that learns from\nthe inhabitant just as the inhabitant learns from the architecture.” Thus, one of the principal challenges is how to construct\n(Paskian) systems that would provide enough variety to keep users engaged, while avoiding randomness, which could lead\nto disengagement if the output cannot be understood. The question: How does architecture avoid boredom and retain a\nhigh degree of novelty—another Paskian challenge. As observed by Haque, “unlike the efficiency-oriented pattern-optimization\napproach taken by many responsive environmental systems, an architecture built on Pask’s system would continually encourage\nnovelty and provoke conversational relationships with human participants.”\nThere are other, more operational-based challenges that have to do with resolution of potential conflicts within systems. For example,\nSterk10 discusses the coordination of responses at coincident, i.e., shared boundaries between spaces, as in a movable partition\nwall between two spaces, which can have actuators accessible by two independent control processes. Another issue is that while\nchange is desirable, for most purposes, it would have to occur in predictable and easily anticipated ways. If that is not possible, then\nthere ought to be a way (in certain circumstances) for users to preview changes before they are executed, or to choose among\nalternatives for one (perhaps suboptimal) that fits the current circumstances, needs, and/or desires. Users may need to be informed\nof the impact that selected changes would have on the environment or the shape and configuration of the space. The overall issue\nof control is critical. In Smart Architecture, Ed van Hinte11 warns that “sometimes a simple and hence ostensibly ‘dumb’ building is\nsmarter than a technology-dominated living-and-working machine over which the user has lost control.”\nWhen it comes to designing adaptive, responsive environments, the “software” side does not seem to present as many\nchallenges as the “hardware” side, the building itself, whose majority of systems are inherently inflexible. That is perhaps where\nthe biggest challenges and opportunities exist, as buildings would have to be conceptually completely rethought in order to\nenable them to adapt (i.e., to reconfigure themselves). Then there is the “middleware” that sits among the software and hardware\nand the users as devices that facilitate the feedback loops between the components of the system.\nThere are also some fundamental questions that have yet to be adequately addressed. For example, while Beesley and his\ncolleagues predict, “the next generation of architecture will be able to sense, change and transform itself,”12 they fail to say\nclearly towards what ends. Even though they ask what very well may be the key question—how do responsive systems affect\nus?—they do not attempt to answer it explicitly. Similarly, Fox and Kemp,13 in their Interactive Architecture book, avoid explaining\nfully—and admit as much—why interactive systems are necessary, meaningful, or useful, and simply state, “the motivation to\nmake these systems is found in the desire to create spaces and objects that can meet changing needs with respect to evolving\nindividual, social, and environmental demands.” Fox and Kemp position interactive architecture “as a transitional phenomenon\nwith respect to a movement from a mechanical paradigm to a biological paradigm,” which, as they explain, “requires not just\npragmatic and performance-based technological understandings, but awareness of aesthetic, conceptual and philosophical\nissues relating to humans and the global environment.”\n\nTOWARDS ARCHITECTURE OF CHANGE\n“Accepting the dynamics of buildings and cities...can turn architectural change into an ecologically efficient process as\nwell as a new urban experience.” —Ed van Hinte, et al., Smart Architecture\nThe quest for an architecture of change is a reflection of the context in which we live and work. An ever-increasing pace\nof change is what defines contemporary life: socio-economic, political, cultural, and, in particular, technological context are\nconstantly shifting, altering the norms, customs, and expectations and affecting how we use and relate to space. A rapidly\nchanging socio-economic, cultural, and technological environment demands buildings that can adapt quickly. How buildings\ncan adapt and how they respond to change depends on the nature of change (i.e., on the context in which the change occurs\n[programmatic use, building systems, etc.]).\nIn Flexible: Architecture that Responds to Change, Robert Kronenburg14 argues that for a building to be “flexible,” it must be\ncapable of (1) adaptation, as a way to better respond to various functions, uses, and requirements; (2) transformation, defined\nas alterations of the shape, volume, form, or appearance; (3) movability; and (4) interaction, which applies to both the inside and\nthe outside of a building. Such capacities in buildings will be provided by “intelligent” building systems, which will be driven by\nmany factors, from environmental ones, such as the control of energy use, to changing the appearance of the building through\nvarying images and patterns. The systems could be either automatic or “intuitive,” suggesting a capacity of the system to infer\nfrom the context an appropriate set of responses without overly explicit inputs.\nIn a quest to establish a context for change and variety in architecture, an international network for so-called Open Building\n(www.open-building.org) was established early in this decade. In Open Building, the focus is on disentangling building systems\nand subsystems from each other so that they can be better organized to facilitate not only their efficient assembly, but also\ntheir disassembly and reassembly in different configurations. Open Building separates the major systems into the building site,\n\n60\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nExploring Architecture of Change\nstructural envelope, division of space inside the building, plumbing, wiring, heating/cooling, and the cabinets, furniture, and\n“other stuff that people put inside the building.” One of the main distinctions that Open Building makes is between “support” and\n“infill,” where “support” refers to the structural envelope, and “infill” to all the other systems that are housed within the envelope.\nWithout referencing the Open Building movement, Tristan d’Estree Sterk15 also separates the components of buildings into two\nmain classes of parts: the serviced spaces (responsive, internal partition systems) and the external shells (responsive building\nenvelopes or structures). Thus, building design becomes two-level: first, the overall structural envelope is designed, and then the\ninfill. Critical to successful implementation are interfaces between different systems, which should be designed to allow different\nchoices of systems and their replacement, as in different fit-out systems applied in each unit, depending on the choices made\nby the users.\nWhile Open Building as a design and building method aims to address the changing social and technical context in which we\nlive and work, it focuses on building systems as a technological enabler for effective changes in use (i.e., adaptive re-use). It\nrecognizes that there are distinct levels of intervention in the built environment; that users may make design decisions, as well;\nthat design is a process that involves many different disciplines and professionals; and that the built environment is in constant\ntransformation (i.e., subject to continuous change) and is the product of a never-ending, ongoing design process in which it is\ntransformed part by part.\nEd van Hinte and the other authors of Smart Architecture16 also articulate a need for architecture to develop ways of designing\nbuildings that can change, but do so with a dimension of time explicitly in mind. According to them, buildings could be divided\ninto seven system-based layers, each with its own lifespan that ranges from centuries, down to a couple of years. The layers\nare (in ascending order, depending on life span): location, structure, access, façade, services, dividing elements, and furniture.\nThey warn that the dynamics of these layersand their different life spanshave to be taken into consideration when designing\n‘integrated’ buildings. (A building with tightly integrated building systems may not have a capacity for change if the systems are\nimpossible to separate and disassemble.)\nIf we were to accept change as a fundamental contextual condition—and time as an essential design dimension—architecture\ncould then begin to truly mediate between the built environment and the people who occupy it. As Ed van Hinte and his\ncolleagues note, “instead of being merely the producer of a unique three-dimensional product, architects should see themselves\nas programmers of a process of spatial change.” The principal task for architects is to create “a field of change and modification”\nthat would generate possibilities instead of fixed conditions. The inhabitable space would then become an indeterminate design\nenvironment, subject to continuous processes of change, occurring in different realms and at various time scales:\nIt is the form that is no longer stable, that is ready to accept change. Its temporary state is determined by the circumstances of\nthe moment on the basis of an activated process and in-built intelligence and potential for change. Not product architecture then,\nbut a process-based architecture whose form is defined by its users’ dynamic behavior and changing demands and by the\nchanging external and internal conditions; an architecture that itself has the characteristics of an ecological system, that emulates\nnature instead of protecting it and therefore engages in a enduring fusion of nature and culture.\nAs Ed van Hinte and his colleagues point out, “that would be a truly ground-breaking ecological architecture.”\n\nEndnotes\n1BALLARD, JAMES GRAHAM, “THE THOUSAND DREAMS OF STELLAVISTA,” IN VERMILION SANDS (LONDON: VINTAGE, 2001), ORIGINALLY\nPUBLISHED IN 1971.\n2 OOSTERHUIS REFERENCE (2002)\n3 PASK, GORDON, “ARCHITECTURAL RELEVANCE OF CYBERNETICS,” IN ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN, SEPTEMBER 1969, PP. 494–496.\n4 NEGROPONTE, NICHOLAS, SOFT ARCHITECTURE MACHINES (CAMBRIDGE, MA: MIT PRESS, 1975).\n5 EASTMAN, CHARLES, “ADAPTIVE-CONDITIONAL ARCHITECTURE,” IN N.

Thus wood displays significant\ndifferentiation in its material makeup and structure as compared to most industrially produced, isotropic materials. Upon\ncloser examination wood can be described as an anisotropic natural fiber system with different material characteristics\nand related behavior in different directions relative to the main grain orientation. Because of its differentiated internal\ncapillary structure wood is also hygroscopic. It absorbs and releases moisture in exchange with the environment and\nthese fluctuations cause differential dimensional changes. In architectural history the inherent heterogeneity of wood\nand the related more complex material characteristics have been mainly understood as a major deficiency by the\nrelated crafts, timber industry, engineers and architects alike. This paper will present an alternative design approach and\nassociated computational design tools that aim at understanding wood’s differentiated material make up as its major\ncapacity rather than a deficiency. Along two design experiments the related research on an integral computational design\napproach towards unfolding wood’s intrinsic material characteristics and performative capacity will be discussed. The\nfirst experiment explores the anisotropic characteristics of wood by exploiting the differential bending behavior in relation\nto the local induction of forces through which a specific overall morphology can be achieved. The second experiment\nfocuses on the hygroscopic property of wood as the base for developing a surface structure that responds to changes\nin relative humidity with no need for any additional electronic or mechanical control.\n\n1 Introduction: The Complex Structure\nand Characteristics of Wood\nWood differs significantly from most other building materials in that it is naturally grown. The resulting differentiated\nmaterial makeup of wood accounts for most of its properties and characteristics (Barnett and Jeronimidis 2003). As\nthe computational design approach presented in this paper aims at exploring ways of capturing and capitalizing on\nthe specific material characteristics of wood, first its heterogeneous structure needs to be understood in greater detail.\n\n66\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nPerformative Wood:\nIntegral Computational Design for Timber Constructions\nTherefore the following paragraphs will serve as a short introduction to the material makeup and anatomical features of\nwood that are of particular relevance to the research and related design experiments presented in this paper.\nContrary to building materials specifically designed and produced to satisfy the needs of architects and engineers,\nwood evolved as a functional tissue of trees. All trees, despite their wide diversity, share certain characteristics. They are\nall vascular, perennial plants capable of secondary thickening, or in other words, of adding yearly growth to previously\ngrown wood. Growth mainly happens in the cambium, a microscopically thin layer of living cells between the bark and\nthe inner stem structure of sapwood and heartwood. Cambial cells have very thin primary walls and divide lengthwise\nduring the growing season. Following the cell division, one of the two newly formed cells enlarges to become yet\nanother cambial mother cell while the other matures either into a bark cell or, if formed toward the inside of the cambium,\na new wood cell. Once these cells have developed to their ultimate shape and size, on the inner surface of the fragile\nprimary cell wall, a secondary wall is built from cellulose consisting of long-chain polymers. The long-chain cellulose\nmolecules are mainly oriented in the direction of the long axis of the cells, which accounts for many of the basic\nproperties of wood. The resulting cellulosic structure is subsequently reinforced by lignin, the material that characterizes\nwoody plants (Hoadley 2000).\nIn order to understand the following research on integral computational design for timber constructions it is critical to\nrecognize the heterogeneous makeup and anisotropic characteristics of wood resulting from the arrangements of\ngrowth layers in the tree, as well as the horizontal or vertical orientation of the individual cells (Dinwoodie 2000). The\ncell structures of softwoods differ considerably from those of hardwoods, which are believed to have evolved much\nlater than the softwoods. In the relatively simple structure of softwoods more than 90% of the wood volume comprises\nof tracheids, the remainder being mostly ray tissues consisting either of ray tracheids or ray parenchyma cells (fig. 1a).\nThe tracheids are fiberlike cells arranged parallel to the stem axis in radial/tangential layers and have an approximate\nlength/diameter ratio of 100/1, in which the length can vary from 2 to 6 millimeters in different species. The tracheid\nmorphology largely determines the structural characteristics of the respective wood.\nA much greater diversity of cell types and more variation in their arrangements are present in hardwoods (fig. 1b) than\nin softwood. The function of support and conduction is accomplished by the evolution of a range of specialized cells.\nFor example vessel elements, which have a very large diameter, and thin side walls but no end walls, are arranged endto-end parallel to the stem axis to form continuous channels for sap conduction. When cut transversely, the exposed\nopen ends of the large conduit-like vessels are called pores. As all hardwoods contain vessel elements they are also\nreferred to as porous woods. In contrast to tracheids and particularly vessels, fiber cells are much smaller in diameter\nand posses closed ends and thick walls, and mainly contribute to the strength of the wood. Critical for the appearance\nand, more importantly, uniformity of hardness in the transverse or radial plane of a hardwood are the size, number and\ndistribution of vessels and fibers. For both softwood and hardwood the structure, distribution and orientation of cells\nare the determining factors for the anisotropic, structural, and hygroscopic characteristics of wood (Wagenführ 1999).\n\nFigure 1a/b Microscopic\nPhotograph of White Pine\n(left) and Black Walnut\n(right) (Hoadley 2000)\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n67\n\nPerformative Wood:\nIntegral Computational Design for Timber Constructions\n2 Integral Computational Design\nIn architecture and structural engineering, the anisotropic and hygroscopic characteristics of wood resulting from its\ninternal cellular structure are traditionally seen as problematic and disadvantageous compared to more homogeneous,\nimpervious and stable, industrially produced materials. While it is commonly understood that any genuine design\napproach for timber constructions requires knowledge of its internal cellular structure, the awareness of its material\nmakeup has been mostly employed to counterbalance its complex material behavior by the related crafts, timber\nindustry, engineers, and architects alike (Herzog 2003). The more recent history of timber construction is littered with\nattempts of compensating for the supposed deficiency of wood, ranging from special construction techniques to the\ndevelopment of industrial wood products that seek to homogenize the material.\nThis paper will present an alternative design approach that aims at understanding wood’s complex material makeup\nand behavior as major advantages rather than deficiencies. Computational design lends itself to such an approach as it\nenables employing complex behavior rather than just modeling a particular shape or form. The transition from currently\npredominant modes of Computer Aided Design (CAD) to Computational Design allows for a significant change of\nemploying the computer’s capacity to instrumentalize wood’s complex behavior in the design process. CAD is very much\nbased on computerized processes of drawing and modeling, stemming from established representational techniques\nin architectural design (Terzidis 2006). In this regard, one of the key differences lies in the fact that CAD internalizes the\ncoexistence of form and information, whereas Computational Design externalizes this relation and thus enables the\nconceptualization of material behavior and related formative processes (Hensel and Menges 2006). In Computational\nDesign, form is not defined through a sequence of drawing or modeling procedures but generated through parametric,\nrule-based processes. The ensuing externalization of the interrelation between algorithmic processing of information\nand resultant form generation permits the systematic distinction between process, information and form. Hence,\nany specific shape can be understood as resulting from the interaction of system-intrinsic information and external\ninfluences within a morphogenetic process (Menges 2008).\nConceiving of computational design processes as morphogenetic enables the systematic integration of material\ncharacteristics and constraints. Therefore, the complex behavior of wood resulting from its differentiated material\nmakeup and structure can constitute an integral aspect of the genotypic datasets from which a specific, phenotypic\nshape is derived. Obviously this requires both in-depth empirical studies of the microstructure and resultant behavior of\nthe wood to be used, as well as the development of appropriate computational design techniques. The two research\nprojects explained in the following paragraphs present different takes on developing such computational design\ntechniques and related timber constructions, each with a special focus on wood-specific characteristics.\n\n3 Performative Wood: Two Research Projects\nThe following two projects form part of the author’s larger research project investigating the possible integration of\ncomputational form generation and materialization. They were chosen as they present two different facets of the\ndevelopment of an alternative, performance oriented approach to the design of timber constructions that unfolds from\nthe inherent characteristics of wood.\n\n3.1 Differential Actuation of Uniform Timber Elements\nThe first research project was developed in the context of the GPA Studio (Michael Hensel, Prof. Achim Menges)\nby David Newton and Joe Kellner at Rice University’s School of Architecture. It explores the possibility of utilizing the\nanisotropy of timber to construct a material system consisting of uniform elements that can be employed to achieve\nvariable yet stable structural configurations with complex curvature through a vast array of local actuations.\nAs a result of its fibrousness, wood displays anisotropic properties. While anisotropy is most often understood as a\nproblematic characteristic of wood, this project explores ways of strategically exploiting it as a significant material capacity\n(Wagenführ 2008). The considerable difference in modulus of elasticity in relation to fiber direction is of particular interest,\nwith the modulus of elasticity parallel to the main fiber direction (between 9000 to 16000 N/mm2 for different kinds of wood)\ngenerally being approximately fifteen times higher than perpendicular to the fibers (between 600 to 1000 N/mm2). In other\nwords, wood has the interesting characteristic of variable stiffness in relation to grain orientation.\nThis project explores the possibility of utilizing the differential elastic deformation of wood under the influence of an\nexternal force to form a material system with enhanced structural capacity. The basic system constituent for achieving\nthis is incredibly simple: an element consisting of two thin, rectangular timber patches, which are fastened to one\nanother in two opposite corners, while the two other corners are equipped with a basic actuator element, in this\ncase simple bolts that act as adjustable spacers. Once these bolts are “actuated,” that is tightened to induce a\nbending force to the lower patch, the element starts to bend along its longitudinal axis, as the main fiber direction\nof both patches is initially parallel to the longer rectangle edge. If the main fiber direction is changed in one or both\npatches in relation to the longitudinal axis, changes in bending behavior and resultant element geometry can be\nobserved. In general, the bending behavior is dependent on a number of parameters such as patch size, length to\nwidth to thickness ratio, actuation force (measured as the torque setting of the bolt), the aforementioned main fiber\ndirection and related modulus of elasticity, as well as the general material properties of the chosen type of wood.\n\n68\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nPerformative Wood:\nIntegral Computational Design for Timber Constructions\nThe same parameters are critical if a larger panel is covered with arrays of these small patches. For such an assembly\nof multiple elements mounted to one panel, the incremental actuation and consequential bending of each individual\nelement leads to a cumulative induction of curvature in the panel (fig. 2).\n\nFigure 2 Top\n(left) and\nBottom Side\n(Right) of Initial\nTest Model\n\nElaborate empirical tests and comparative analysis established the relation between different variable settings\nfor the aforementioned parameters and the resultant shape changes of the panel assembly. For these particular\nexperiments, and all subsequent tests, birch was chosen due to its remarkable properties of being relatively elastic\nwhile having high bending strength at the same time.\nBased on the findings of the first tests, the number of variable parameters was limited to [i] the main orientation of\nelements on either side of the panel, [ii] the actuation setting for each bolt (specified through the torque setting)\nand [iii] the changes of main fiber direction (defined as the deviation angle from the longitudinal axis). In subsequent\nempirical test series, the specific behavior of the panel’s shape change resulting from changes to these parameters’\nvariables was investigated and encoded step by step in a parametric computational model. Based on the empirically\nestablished database, which remains open and extendable in case more information becomes available in the future,\na number of interrelated recursive procedures derive the parameter settings, and the related actuation protocol\nrequired for the construction of any specified system geometry within the limits of the material capacity.\nThe computational set-up was further refined by additional tests exploring the changes in behavior of larger\nassemblies, consisting of arrangements with multiple horizontal and vertical rows of panels (fig. 3). The investigation\nof the non-linear increase in gravitational impact, especially in areas of system overhang, as well as the increase in\nstiffness at overlapping panel joints, further informed the developed computational process for modelling the required\nconstruction data for larger material systems.\nFigure 3\nActuators on\nLarger Surface\nAssemblies\n\nAs a final corroboration of the developed integral computational design process and related material system, a large\nscale prototype was constructed based on the information obtained by the computationally derived assembly and\nactuation protocols (fig. 4). Consisting of 48 identical panels, 1920 equal patches, and 7680 bolts, the structure\ninitially remains to be entirely planar and flexible. Only through the subsequent tightening of each actuator bolt,\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n69\n\nPerformative Wood:\nIntegral Computational Design for Timber Constructions\nguided by the computationally derived data, does\nthe structure incrementally assume curvature and\nrise into a stable, self-supporting state.\nDue to the significant convex and concave curvature\nassumed in the ultimate state of actuation, the\nsystem gains considerable load-bearing capacity\n(fig. 5). The ten-meter-long but just four-millimetresthick structure becomes astonishingly stiff and\ndisplays a remarkable level of structural performance,\nespecially when compared to the extremely flexible\nstate after primary assembly. In addition, if need be,\nthe shape of the system can be changed at any\ntime by changing the actuator setting based on an\nupdated actuation protocol. This demonstrates how\nan integral computational design process based on\nthe capacity inherent to the anisotropic nature of wood can derive a reconfigurable, performative material system\nmade up of amazingly simple, uniform timber elements.\n\nFigure 4 Graphic\nof Computationally\nDerived Assembly and\nActuation Protocol\n\n3.2 Responsive Veneer Surface Structure\nThe second research project was developed in the Department for Form Generation and Materialisation (Prof. Achim\nMenges) by Steffen Reichert at HFG Offenbach. It investigates the hygroscopic characteristics of wood and aims\nat employing the related dimensional changes of wood resulting from changes in relative humidity to construct a\nclimate-responsive surface structure.\n\nFigure 5 Large\nScale Prototype\n\nThe fiber saturation point describes the state in which the cell walls of timber are fully saturated with bound water,\nwhereas the cell cavities are emptied of free water. How much of the bound water evaporates and therefore how\nmuch shrinkage will occur mainly depends on the relative humidity level of the atmosphere; for example at 100%\nrelative humidity, no bound water is lost while all bound water would be removed at zero relative humidity. As\nexplained in the introduction, the long axis of the cells is more or less parallel to the orientation of the long-chain\ncellulosic structure in the cell walls. Consequently, as water molecules leave and enter the cell walls due to changes\nin relative humidity, the resulting shrinkage or swelling is mainly perpendicular to the cell walls and does almost not\ninfluence their length. Thus the main effect of changing bound water content in wood occurs in tangential shrinkage\n\n70\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nPerformative Wood:\nIntegral Computational Design for Timber Constructions\nand swelling and the correlated dimensional changes. The anatomical structure of wood causes the main difference\nbetween tangential and radial shrinkage and swelling, the later having generally a considerably lower value due to the\nrestraining effect of wood rays, whose long axes are radially oriented (Skaar 1988).\nThe main focus of this project is utilizing the hygroscopic characteristics of wood in the development of a surface\nstructure capable of adapting its porosity to changing humidity levels. Rather than employing complicated electromechanical control devices, the project aims at employing the shape change of simple veneer elements triggered by\nchanging bound-water content. The gaps opening up between the deformed veneer elements and the substructure\nlocally regulate the structure’s degree of porosity. At any stage in the design process, the complex reciprocal\nmodulation of environmental conditions triggering changes in thermodynamic behavior and at the same time affecting\nthe material response to changes in relative humidity needs to be considered.\nThe development process commenced with a series of\nphysical experiments investigating a simple composite\nveneer element (fig. 6). Critical variables of the key\nelement’s parameters, as for example the length-widththickness ratio in relation to main fiber directionality, were\ntested for their influence on the element’s shape change\nand response time in changing humidity conditions.\nInitially, rotary cut beech veneer was selected on the base\nof its high-swelling and shrinkage value in the tangential\nplane. However, a number of comparative empirical tests\nproved that sycamore maple veneer was more suitable\ndue to its considerably lower elastic modulus.\n\nFigure 6 Composite\nVeneer Plate Responding\nto Changes in\nRelative Humidity\n\nFigure 7a/b CFD\nAnalysis (left) /\nComponents in Closed\nand Opened State (right)\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n71\n\nPerformative Wood:\nIntegral Computational Design for Timber Constructions\nFollowing the first series of empirical tests, the development of a surface element as the basic constituent of the\nsystem commenced. Through iterative computational and physical test models, the element is derived as an\nassociative geometric component based on the manufacturing and assembly logics of a larger, multi-component\nsystem, as well as investigations of the thermodynamic behavior of the element’s open and closed state (fig. 7a).\nThe resulting surface component consists of a load-bearing substructure on which two triangular veneer elements\nare mounted along their long edge. The substructure to which the moisture-sensitive elements are attached is\ndeveloped as a parametrically defined folded structure with planar component-to-component attachment faces.\nThe cut pattern of each component to be constructed from sheet material is automatically generated through the\nparametric computational model. Similarly, the associative model defines the main fiber direction of the element as\nbeing parallel to the fixed edge, which is also reflected in the automatically derived cut pattern of each element. The\nveneer element’s shape change perpendicular to the main fiber direction caused by changes in relative humidity\nresults in local surface openings (fig. 7b).\nAn increase of moisture content triggered by a rising level of relative humidity causes the swelling of the veneer\nelements. Due to the fibrous restrictions of wood anatomy explained above, the elements expand primarily in the\ntangential plane orthogonal to the grain. This dimensional change causes a shape change and the veneer elements\ncurl up, creating an opening for ventilation. A large number of test cycles verified that the movement induced by\nmoisture absorption is fully reversible. Furthermore, the response time is surprisingly short. The shift from a closed to\na fully open state takes less than 20 seconds given a substantial increase in relative humidity.\nInstrumentalizing the material’s hygroscopic behavior, the simple veneer elements are in one sensor, actuator and\nporosity control element. The developed component enables the construction of a locally controlled, humidityresponsive surface structure, in which each sub-location independently senses changes of local humidity\nconcentrations and reacts by changing the local level of system porosity. The emergent thermodynamic modulation\nalong and across the surface is directly influenced by both the local component geometry as well as the overall\nsystem morphology (fig. 8).\n\nIn order to account for the complex reciprocity of individual component and overall system behavior and related\nmacro- and micro-thermodynamic modulations, a feedback-based evolutionary computational process is used\nto prototypically develop a global surface articulation. For this process, the surface geometry is mathematically\ncontrolled through an equation with a number of variables. Iterative changes to these variables provide a robust\nyet simple base for the hygromorphic evolution of the surface geometry. This process is driven by the stochastic\nalteration of the mathematical surface, the subsequent associative component generation, and the related Computer\nFluid Dynamics analysis of each system instance’s behavior. The relevant data is continuously fed back and informs\nthe next system generation. The evolving load-bearing structure’s overall curvature orients the responsive veneer\nelements either towards or away from local airstreams and humidity concentrations. The resultant calibration of\noverall curvature and local component morphology in different opening states enables a highly specific modulation\nof airflow and related humidity levels across and along the system.\n\n72\n\nFigure 8 Iterative CFD\nAnalysis During The\nGlobal Surface Evolution\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nPerformative Wood:\nIntegral Computational Design for Timber Constructions\nFigure 9a/b Functional\nPrototype (left)\nwith Responsive\nVeneer Skin (right)\n\nFigure 10 Functional\nFull-Scale Prototype\n(left) / Close-Up\nView (Right)\n\nIn order to verify and further inform the developed integral design approach, a full-scale, functional surface prototype\nwas built from 600 geometrically different components (fig. 9a). Subsequent test cycles confirmed the performative\ncapacity of the responsive surface structure (fig. 9b). Once exposed to changes in relative humidity, the veneer\ncomposite elements respond by opening or closing components, resulting in different degrees of porosity over time\nand across the surface. Thus the resultant material system is directly responsive to environmental influences with\nno need for any additional electronic or mechanical control. This demonstrates the high level of integration of form,\nstructure, and material capacity enabled by the computational design process (fig. 10).\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n73\n\nPerformative Wood:\nIntegral Computational Design for Timber Constructions\nConclusion\nThe research presented in this paper demonstrates both the potentiality inherent to an integral design approach\nutilizing the particular material characteristics of wood and the capacity of computational design tools to facilitate\nsuch an approach. The innovation in design methodology presented through the two research projects is based\non an in-depth investigation of the material anatomy and resultant characteristics from which performative material\nsystems are developed through custom-scripted computational design tools.\nNevertheless, what has been presented here needs to be understood as the first development stages of basic\nresearch requiring further elaboration. One obvious goal may be the more comprehensive integration of material\nsimulation procedures as developed for timber engineering applications in order to achieve more precise feedback\nin the design oriented tools. However, this only becomes productive and coherent with the overarching argument\npresented here, if the variability inherent to timber anatomy can be more directly embedded as well. For example,\none of the obvious shortcomings of both research projects presented above is the way they generalize material\nmake-up and, in particular, fiber direction. While the integration of wood properties approximated more as orthotropic\nrather than truly anisotropic characteristics is already a step forward, the full recognition and integration of individual\nfiber direction in more adaptive computational design processes may yield further potential. For this purpose, highspeed pre-scanning of the individual anatomy of each timber element to be used may be necessary. As such,\nprocesses are already in use in the timber industry, as for example, for the recognition and removal of knotholes in\nhigh-quality timber panels. This seems to be a realistic goal rather than a mere vision.\n\nRefErences\nBARNETT J. R. AND JERONIMIDIS G. EDS. (2003). WOOD QUALITY AND ITS BIOLOGICAL BASIS.

This paper proposes an interface that enables the user\nto parametrically search for such tilings. Assembly rules are explained by which arbitrary geometry as specified\nby NURBS surfaces may be based on the pattern to form a non-repeating complex surface. As an example, the\nfabrication in concrete of a cylindrical tiling is used to demonstrate the mass production of a continuous, free-flowing\nstructure with the aid of a minimum amount of formwork.\nKeywords: Quasicrystals, aperiodic tiling, strip projection method, assembly rules, tangential continuity, formwork, modularity.\n\n1 Introduction\nIn The Self-Made Tapestry, Philip Ball defines pattern as “arrays of units that are similar but not necessarily identical,\nand which repeat but not necessarily regularly or with a well-defined symmetry” (Ball 1982). Patterns are rendered by\nexternal forces and travel extensively in space, motifs are static and self-contained. Quasi-periodic structures were\ndiscovered in 1982 within the field of crystallography from electrons diffraction disclosing patterns with icosahedral\nsymmetry (DiVincenzo and Steinhardt 1999). They are special crystals with no translational symmetry. That is,\ncontrary to crystals they cannot repetitively align themselves as tiles or building blocks to fill up space without\nresorting to rotational symmetry. Crystals have close-range order, whereas quasicrystalline structures disclose longrange order even though they are comprised of only few different polygons. A 2D Penrose tiling portrays a similar\nstructure to those found in Quasicrystals. Growing interests in aperiodic structures have been applied in recent years\nwithin the field of design. The Water Cube (National Swimming Centre) for the Beijing Olympics by PTW Architects\nand Arup, the RMIT Storey Hall in Melbourne, Australia, by ARM Architects, or Aranda/Lash’s quasi-furniture (Aranda\nand Lash 2006) are some examples. Philip Beesley’s Orgone Reef installation (Beesley 2005) uses a Penrose\ntessellation as a subtle underlying geometry to efficiently organize its intricate hybrid fabric and allow its structure\napparent freedom from periodic symmetry. Architecture profits from the intrinsic properties of aperiodic formation as\nit provides modularity without the repetition of the same module throughout (e.g., Erwin Hauer architectural screen\n[Hauer 2007] or a singular object built up of many variant components (e.g., Greg Lynn BlobWall [Lynn 2008]. In all\ncases, the patterns are used to generate apparent variety of form from a limited set of basic polygons. This they do\neconomically and precisely. The well-known tilings by Penrose (Penrose 1989) and Danzer (Danzer 1989) are only\ntwo examples of an infinite set of possible tilings. In 1981, N.G. De Bruin (De Bruin 1981) showed that the Penrose\npattern could be seen as the projection of an object in 5-dimensional space onto a plane, and Marjorie Senechal\n(Senechal 1995) suggested an early implementation, asking Eugenio Durand to develop a program to generate\nPenrose tilings using the projection method (Durand 1994). Related methods like the Updown generation method\n(Austin 2005) and the dual grid or Pentagrid method (Duffy 2004) for generating such tilings also exist. This paper\nproposes an interface that enables the user to parametrically search through this infinite set of such tilings, and thus\ngenerate a base on which to form a non-repeating complex surface that can be used in architecture.\n\n75\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nQuasi-Projection: Aperiodic Concrete Formwork for\nPerceived Surface Complexity\n2 The Strip Projection Method\nThe basis of the projection method consists of selecting from a regular n-dimensional grid all the points falling\nwithin an area defined by a clipping boundary (the strip), and then of projecting the selected points onto a lower\ndimensional sub-space.\n\n2.1 From 2d to 1d (x, y)\nIn figure 1b, a set of points are projected from a 2-dimensional grid onto a 1-dimensional line. If the gray segments\nwere labelled A and the dark ones B, the angle between the line and the grid axis results in a series of this sort:\n{...ABABAABABAABABABAAB...}. Although only the two units A and B are used throughout, their arrangement\ndoes not form a group that repeats itself across the series. This in contrast to strings disclosing clear translational\nsymmetry such as {...BBBBBBBBBBB...} in figure 1a or {...AABAABAABAAB...}. The latter can be produced by\nsetting the clipping boundary in perfect alignment with an axis, or at an angle exactly through a given series of points,\nbut any rotation defined by irrational numbers, as they are not expressible as whole number fractions, will result in an\naperiodic pattern. The number of these angles is infinite, and changing from one to the next allows a different pattern\nto emerge. Just as this single rotation angle is the controlling parameter for the one dimensional set, the parameters\nof rotation in higher dimensions will completely specify two or three-dimensional patterns. Selection of the points to\nproject is determined by the depth of the clipping boundary. The strip selected is set just wide enough to incorporate\nonly the points falling within one unit of the 2-dimensional lattice. As the highlighted strips show in figure 1a and 1b,\nit is not a constant amount, but must vary when the lattice is rotated due to the changing depth of the unit diagonal.\nThe strip is defined by two boundary lines:\nY1= 0; fixed at the origin\nY2= [min. to max.]; shifting from 1 to sqrt(2) upon x-y rotation\nIn solving for this, a depth vector was created on the diagonal of a single grid unit (from (0, 0) to (1, 1)) and multiplied\nby the rotation matrix. The second boundary line is then defined as the y-value of this depth vector, and all points of\nthe lattice smaller or equal to this are used in the projection.\n\n2.2 From 3d to 2d (x, y, z)\nExactly the same method is applied to perform the projection from the third dimension, where there are three\npossible rotations: in the X-Y, Y-Z, and Z-X plane. For each rotation exists a specific rotation matrix, which when\nmultiplied by a vector, will cause that vector to rotate. In practice, the three rotations are multiplied into one overall\nrotational matrix. Below is an example of a 3D rotation matrix around the Y-axis or the X-Z plane, where Alpha can\nparametrically range from 0 to 360 degrees.\n\n(x, y, z, 1) *\n\nx\ny\nx |cosa0\ny |0\n1\nz |sina0\na |0\n0\n\nz a\n-sina 0 |\n0 0 |\ncosa0 |\n01|\n\nx\ny\nz\na\n= (x*cosa+ z*sina, y, -x*sina+ z*cosa, 1)\n\nThe same principle also applies for higher dimensions. In 4 dimensions (x, y, z, a, b), there are 6 possible rotation\nmatrices (M 5, 5) in each plane: x-y, x-z, y-z, x-a, y-a, z-a. In 5 dimensions (x, y, z, a, b, c), there are 10 possible\nrotation matrices (M 6, 6) in each plane: x-y, x-z, y-z, x-a, y-a, z-a, x-b, y-b, z-b, a-b. In 6 dimensions, there are\n15 possible rotations; in 7 dimensions, 21 possible rotations, etc. The values for each of these rotations define the\nresulting pattern uniquely and precisely, and when treated as parameters, they allow the generation of any of the\ninfinite set of aperiodic patterns.\n\n3 Ensuring the depth of the clipping boundary\nThe depth vector for a 3D to 2D projection is from (0, 0, 0) to (1, 1, 1). The width of the strip is meant to be the total\ndepth of a single unit of the grid, but the first quadrant unit diagonal (1, 1, 1) only functions as an appropriate clipping\ndepth when rotation is within the first quadrant. Beyond this, the diagonal will have rotated too far and may have an\noverall depth less than another diagonal vector (e.g. (1, 1, -1)) or may even point behind the notional hyperplane of\nprojection (a hyperplane is an n-dimensional generalization of a plane; an affine subspace of dimension n-1 that splits\nan n-dimensional space (wiktionary.org / accessed June, 2008)).\nWhat needs to be avoided is a negative depth vector. A pre-emptive measure to this problem is to verify the signs of\nits coordinates before rotations. This was done by checking against its z-value (0, 0, 1), since clipping occurs along\nthe z-axis (fig.1c, 1d), and by multiplying it by the inverse of the overall rotation matrix (the inverse of a rotation matrix\nis its transpose; flip along its diagonal). If any of its coordinates turned out negative (e.g. (0.651, -0.781, -0.265)),\n\n76\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nQuasi-Projection: Aperiodic Concrete Formwork for\nPerceived Surface Complexity\nthen the sign(s) of the corresponding coordinates of the original depth vector are flipped accordingly (1, -1, -1). As\nshown in figure 1e, boundary errors can become significant in preventing a tiling from being entirely projected and\nfrom continuously progressing under any rotational changes. There, Z2 was 1.09 units and its depth_Vec was in the\nSW quadrant whereas in figure 1f, the adjusted Z2 is now 1.58 units and its depth_Vec in the NE quadrant.\n\nFigure 1: 1a 2-dimensional lattice projected in 1 dimension; b Same as 1a but after rotation disclosing an aperiodic structure; 1c Periodic tiling\nunder specific rotation. The highlighted strip is the X-Z projection of a 3d lattice showing the space between the two clipping planes (z1, z2)\nfor points selection; 1d Aperiodic tiling from a 3d grid projected in 2d; 1e 2d projection on the x-y plane of a 3d grid with incomplete tiling; 1f\nSame as 1e but with the corrected depth vector making a complete tiling.\n\n4 Clipping more than one dimension\nExisting literature (Durand 1994, Weber 1997) on the subject presents the projection method with the aid of a 2d\nto 1d projection diagram (as in fig.1b), but is somewhat ambiguous about the description of the clipping offset for\nhigher dimensions. The problem can be visualized in the case of projection onto a line. When clipping occurs from 2d\nto 1d it is within an area clearly defined by the line of projection and another offset from it. If one attempts to project\nfrom a 3d grid to a 1d line however, there are several possible definitions for this offset, two of which can potentially\nbe used to determine the clipping boundary. One will be referred to here as the rectangular method, the other as\nthe cylindrical method. The rectangular approach is that the line of projection is actually identified as the intersection\nof two planes (or hyperplanes) defined by the dimensions that are to be clipped, in which case the offset is given\nby offsetting each of these planes. The clipping boundary is that rectangular area bounded by the four planes. The\nsecond definition takes the line of projection as just a simple line and its offset is determined by all the points that are\nequidistant to it in three dimensions, i.e. a cylinder.\n\n4.1 From 4d to 2d (x, y, z, a)\nIn 4-dimensional space, with 6 possible rotations, two dimensions need to be clipped against (z, a) in order to be\nprojected in 2d (x, y). The key issue is to establish if the clipping boundaries in those two dimensions are determined\nindividually by the rectangular method or in a pre-combined manner by the cylindrical. The z-a reference plane in\nthe following diagrams (fig. 2a to 2c) helps to visualize the differences between the two approaches. The cylindrical\nmethod has a larger selection area upon rotations contrary to the rectangular method. For instance, as the depth\nvector in the rectangular method approaches the a-axis or the z-axis, the area is progressively being reduced to a\nline (fig. 2a, 2d). This will inevitably create holes till no points at all will be found within the clipping boundary. The first\nmethod was computed by initializing the 16 points (x, y, z, a) making up a one unit 4d hypercube and by updating\nthe clipping planes positions as the 4d points were rotated. Two vectors (z_depth, a_depth) constantly spanned 2\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n77\n\nQuasi-Projection: Aperiodic Concrete Formwork for\nPerceived Surface Complexity\nof those 16 points in making sure they always incorporated the smallest z_min and a_min and the largest z_max\nand a_max (fig 2f).\nPoint selection for the rectangular method:\nIf (z1 plane < X.z <= z2 plane) And if (a1 plane < X.a <= a2 plane)\nThen X is inside the clipping boundary and selected.\nPoint selection for the cylindrical method:\nIf (z1 plane < (sq(X.z) + sq(X.a))*0.25) < z2 plane\nThen X is inside the clipping boundary and selected.\n\nFigure 2: 2a Diagram of the rectangular method; 2b Diagram of the cylindrical method; 2c Area difference between both\nmethods; 2d Diagram of the rectangular method to define the clipping boundary for a 3d to 1d projection (line on the x-axis);\n2e Same as in fig. 2d but for the cylindrical method; 2f 4d hypercube and its clipping plane positions subject to a set of\nrotations. The red line is the depth vector.\n\nTo establish which was best suited, a comparative test was carried out between the two methods. A hypercubic\ngrid of points in four dimensions was directly projected onto a two dimensional plane using each method separately\nand jumping down two dimensions at once. For the rectangular method, points were missing in 2d upon arbitrary\nrotations (fig.3a) whereas the cylindrical method always presented the same complete projected tiling (fig. 3b). These\nshowed that only the cylindrical method makes a complete tiling. It was further established (fig. 3c to 3f) that contrary\nto the rectangular method, the cylindrical performed as well in jumping down two or more dimensions from higher\ndimensional grids: 5d to 3d (n-2), 5d to 2d (n-3), 6d to 2d (n-4)\n\n4.2 Depth of the clipping boundary\nThe depth vector for a 4d to 2d projection goes from (0, 0, 0, 0) to (1, 1, 1, 1). Similarly to the principle used from 3d\nto 2d, the correct clipping boundary requires positive values in each of the dimensions being clipped against (z, a). A\nvector of one unit for these dimensions (0, 0, 1, 1) is multiplied by the inverse of the overall rotation matrix to check\nwhich quadrant it lies in. If any of its coordinates has a negative sign (e.g. (0.631, -0.579, -0.067, 0.345)), then the\ncorresponding coordinates of the initial diagonal unit vector are consequently flipped (e.g. (1, -1, -1, 1)) to guarantee\nthat when rotated by the overall rotation matrix, the clipping dimensions retain each a positive value.\n\n5 Adjacency analysis for adapted NURBS geometry\nFound tilings can further systematize the adaptation of other types of geometries without compromising the efficient\nrepetition and distribution of few elements into a diverse field. NURBS tiles are here chosen among other possible\ngeometries to test if while constrained to their initial polygons (e.g., 6 tiles in 4d) and to their inherent assembly rules,\n\n78\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nQuasi-Projection: Aperiodic Concrete Formwork for\nPerceived Surface Complexity\ntangential continuity between tiles can flow free off the tiles’ edges into a continuous assemblage of a long-range\norder. A search through a tiling first determines for each tile’s edge which other adjacent edges from other tiles it\nhas in common and allows to group common edges into a series of independent NURBS linetypes. For instance,\nin figure 4a a minimum of four different linetypes were disclosed from a 4d tiling made of 6 tiles (5 in 5d, 6 in 6d).\nAlthough the surface of a NURBS tile is defined by its four NURBS edges, it is made of two sets of different linetypes\n(fig. 4c). Each line type’s control points can be parametrically manipulated in x, y and z (fig. 4d) causing the entire\nfield to readjust upon local changes. Geometrical offsets of two kinds, central to an edge and at the vertices, ensure\ntangential continuity between NURBS tiles (fig. 4f). In addition, openings were experimented with to engage the twosidedness of a tiling and its corresponding thickness. Both openings at vertices and at middle of tiles were generated\nby an offset tiling perforating the top one (fig. 4b, 4e). Figure 4b demonstrates how following these assembly rules,\nNURBS tiles may extend past a tiling’s original polygons and form a non-repeating complex surface. A 5d tiling is\ncomposed of ten tiles or less in some cases. The 2d Penrose is such a case. Even though constructed of only 2\ndifferent rhombi, it can as well be generated by the 2d projection of a 5d grid where 10 emerging tiles becomes just\n2 sets of 5 identical tiles under specific rotations and only calling for one singular linetype. Subject to an adjacency\nanalysis, a 2D Penrose could be thought as a more generic 5d type (10 tiles, 40 edges, 5 linetypes) so that a NURBS\ngeometry can make up for a greater diversity in a field formation from the exact same tiling (fig. 3c).\n\nFigure 3: 3a Incomplete 2d tiling using the rectangular projection method from a 4d grid (6tiles); 3b Completed 2d tiling using the circular\nmethod; 3c 2d Penrose from a 5d grid projected in 2d; 3d Tiling from a 5d grids projected in 3d; 3e Tiling from a 5d grids projected in 2d; 3f\nHybrid tiling from a 6d grid projected in 2d (x, y, z, a, b, c)\n\n6 A concrete application of a quasi-cylinder\nA sub-region of the 2d or 3d projection of an n-dimensional tiling can be rolled into a cylinder and close perfectly on itself\nwithout incrementing the number of dissimilar tiles required for a tiling (fig 5a). The length of a quasi-cylinder (both along\nits rotational axis and transversal to it) for any tiling is limited to lengths for which local periodicity exists in the regions\nto be joined, and is therefore always finite, but regions of significant length can be found. Any tiles on the cylinder are\naskew in regards to its central axis (rotated polygons) and describe a surface of double curvature. Taking into account\nany thickness for a cylindrical tile causes its edges to wrap and twist while perpendicularly converging along the central\naxis (fig 5c). Figure 5b presents the 6 NURBS tiles’ new spatial arrangement (from the geometrical properties of the\nquasi roller) for the fabrication of a 275cm diameter prototype made of 39 concrete elements(from 6 different tiles).\nFor each tile a polystyrene mould was devised in 8 removable parts (fig. 6d) and reuse for repetitive casting (5x6 and\n1x9). The concrete NURBS tiles were then bolted together following tiling’s corresponding assembly rules (fig 6c, 6e).\nAlthough in this case an edge from a concrete tile can match 5 other edges from different tiles (6x4 edges for 4 different\nlinetypes), tangential continuity is maintained for any local combinations (fig. 6b). Mass production of tiles from the least\namount of moulds demonstrated that their cylindrical assembly remained diverse and free-flowing (fig. 6a).\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n79\n\nQuasi-Projection: Aperiodic Concrete Formwork for\nPerceived Surface Complexity\n\nFigure 4: 4a Adjacency analysis from the 4d tiling shown in figure 3b; 4b 5d and 4d NURBS tiling; 4c 6 tiles in 4d showing 4\ndifferent line types in sets of 2 for each NURBS tile; 4d Same as 4c with parametric curve line type at edge of tile; 4e.NURBS\ntiles with openings at the vertices; 4f 5d tiling (10 tiles) with tangential offsets\n\nFigure 5: 5a Rolling of a\n4d tiling into a cylinder;\n5b Views of 6 NURBS\ntiles with openings;\n5c Side view of NURBS\ntiles converging to the\ncentral axis of cylinder\n\nConclusion\nImplications of this as applied in construction are a step toward efficiency of means: the minimum amount of\nformwork to produce maximum overall complexity. By exposing and probing the space inside which aperiodic\nstructures emerged, the proposed interface extends the quantity of already known tilings to an infinite number of\npossibilities for any number of higher dimensions. These may be used as scaffolds, on which alternative geometries\ncan smoothly plot their courses past the tiles’ boundaries and present relatively complex pattern formations without\ncompromising the scaffolds’ efficiency. It has been demonstrated that one can generate modular systems that are\nnot restricted to repetitions of the same periodic pattern, and these were used to enable the mass production of a\ncontinuous, free-flowing structure with the aid of few moulds.\n\nContributors\nElsa Caetano for the NURBS parametric modelling and the fabrication of the quasi-roller\nGuan lee for the fabrication of the quasi-roller\n\n80\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nQuasi-Projection: Aperiodic Concrete Formwork for\nPerceived Surface Complexity\n\nFigure 6: 6a Field model of 4d cylindrical NURBS tiles; 6b Close up of prototype showing exterior flow between elements; 6c Close up of interior\nassembly; 6d Polystyrene part moulds for concrete casting; 6e Full scale prototype of quasi-roller\n\nReferences\nAranda and Lash. 2006.

Computational systems like cellular automata\nseem to suggest that it might be possible for modular material systems to self-assemble into complex organizations.\nA single series of modular parts could be capable of producing not only complex behavior, but also, depending on\ninitial conditions, simple periodic behavior. The research outlined in this paper uses simple geometric transformations\nto produce tectonic computers that can be applied to a variety of building systems. These “lock-and-key” mechanisms\nallow for the construction of complex surfaces and structures, with minimal instructional documents. The aim of this\nresearch is ultimately to redefine construction methodology as a series of localized operations that eliminate the need\nfor centralized planning.\nThis paper outlines a methodology for encoding and decoding material assemblages as discrete computational\nsystems. Exploiting the combinatorial nature of tectonic systems makes it possible to produce a population of “material\nalgorithms” capable of exhibiting a wide range of behaviors. Encoding assemblages as discrete systems affords\nthe designer the ability to enumerate and search all possible permutations of a tectonic system. In this paper, we\nwill discuss the calculations and computational processes used to encode material assemblages as populations of\ndiscrete algorithms. The application of this methodology to the design and assemblage of a series of vertical stacking\nmasonry blocks will also be discussed in detail.\n\n1 Introduction\nA Cellular Automaton is a discrete computational model studied in a variety of scientific disciplines. Cellular Automata\nare generally visualized as arrays of discrete elements, a one or a zero. As each discrete element looks at neighboring\nor adjacent cells once at each time step, its state evolves with time. For example, in elementary cellular automata, each\ncell can potentially hold one binary state, and it looks at the two nearest neighbors on the grid for instructions regarding\nits current state. For example, if given cells number one, two and three, cell number two will define its current state by\nlooking at three distinct positions in the array. It will look at itself (c), cell number one (c-1), and cell number three (c+1).\nThe number of neighbors it looks at is defined by what shall be referred to as the automaton’s radius. For example, an\nelementary cellular automaton has a radius of 1. Three cells will be evaluated before calculating one cell in the following\nevolution. Imagine a row of ones and zeros and that we want to know what the center-most value will be after one\nevolution of the system. With a radius of 1, we would have to look at one cell to the left and one cell to the right in order\nto determine the next evolution of the center cell. In a 1⁄2-radius automaton, we would have to look at 1⁄2 a cell on the\nright and 1⁄2 a cell on the left; as a result, only one cell would be examined.\nKnowing the radius and number of possible states, we can construct a rule table. The rule table refers to the results\nof all possible combinations of potential neighborhoods, and all the potential resulting states in the next evolution.\nThis combinatorial property of discrete systems allows us to enumerate all the possible rules and resulting behaviors,\nthereby, producing a nonhierarchical, finite search space of potential behaviors.\n\n82\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nComputational Tectonics\nAbstract models such as these translate nicely into modeling tectonic systems. These models assume that each new\naddition is dependent on some portion of the existing assemblage. Each element in the global assemblage has an\nassociated neighborhood. These neighborhoods provide an entry point into modeling tectonic systems. For example,\nin most building systems, each successive addition to an assembly is made possible only by the preceding additions\nto the structure. Although, historically, most tectonic systems have produced linear and deterministic behavior, using\nthe methodology outlined in this paper, it is possible to create systems of assembly that self-structure into a variety of\norganizations using the same system of connections.\n\n2 Enumerating\nLet us begin by building a system with two possible states and a 1⁄2 radius. State one shall be labeled as 0 and state two\nshall be labeled as 1. A 1⁄2-radius system will have to evaluate a neighborhood of two cells {0,1},{1,1},{0.0}, etc... and then\nproduce a new cell of some resulting value, either a zero or a one. Table 1 outlines neighborhood configurations for both\nautomatons, with a radius of 1⁄2 and of 1, respectively. Calculation of these sets will be discussed in succeeding paragraphs.\nTable 1: Sample Neighborhood Enumerations for Binary Rules (0 or 1)\nRadius\n1⁄2 = neighborhood of 2 cells {0,0},{0,1},{1,0},{1,1}\n1 = neighborhood of 3 cells {0,0,0},{0,0,1},{0,1,0},{0,1,1},{1,0,0},{1,0,1},{1,1,0},{1,1,1}\nWe repeat this process to calculate all possible results for each neighborhood configuration. However, this time, we\nsubstitute the number of cells in each neighborhood for the length of the output from table 1 so that each neighborhood\nhas one digit associated with it. For example, in the 1⁄2-radius rule, we want to enumerate all the possible combinations\nof 0 and 1 with a length of four; one possible output might be {1,1,0,1}. Table 2 contains some example output that\nillustrates this point.\nTable 2: All Possible Outcomes for Potential Neighborhoods\nNeighborhood Size\nPossible Resulting States\n1⁄2 radius = neighborhood size of 4 {0,0,0,0},{0,0,0,1},{0,0,1,0},{0,0,1,1},{0,1,0,0},{0,1,0,1},{0,1,1,0},{0,1,1,1},\n{1,0,0,0},{1,0,0,1},{1,0,1,0},{1,0,1,1},{1,1,0,0},{1,1,0,1},{1,1,1,0},{1,1,1,1}\n1 radius = neighborhood size of 8\nFigure 1 All 1⁄2 radius\ntwo color rules\nfrom random initial\nconditions\n\n{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},{0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0},{0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1},\n{0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1},{0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0},{0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1}...\nResults are too long for publication total solutions equal 256\n\nWe then superimpose the two matrixes, constructing a table of all possible rules. The superimposition\nof the two arrays matches each neighborhood in table 1 with the results in table 2; the neighborhood\nfor the 1⁄2-radius automaton looks like, {0,0},{0,1},{1,0},{1,1}. Then we sequentially match each of\nthe possible resulting states from table 2 with each of the neighborhoods from Table 1. For example,\nif we take the second entry from table 2 for the 1⁄2-radius automaton {0,0,0,1} and match it with the\npotential neighborhoods {0,1},{1,0},{0,0},{1,1}, the resulting rule will be {0,0}=0, {0,1}=0, {1,0}=0,\n{1,1}=1. See table 4 for an example of a rule table for a 1⁄2-radius automaton. Sixteen rules are\npossible.\nTable 4: All Possible Rules for a 1⁄2 Radius Automaton\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=0},\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=1},\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=0},\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=1},\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=0},\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=1},\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=0},\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=1},\n\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=0},\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=1},\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=0},\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=1},\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=0},\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=1},\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=0},\n{{0,0}=0,{0,1}=0,{1,0}=0,{1,1}=1},\n\n2.1 Rule Execution and Searching Behaviors\nOne of the advantages of working with discrete systems, such as we have discussed above, is that\nit enables the designer to know the full range of possible behaviors that the system is capable of. The\nadvantage of working through a design in this way, as a set of abstract parameters, is that it is now\npossible to run tests quickly on these rules and to perform statistical analysis on the output, helping us\nfind rules that work best for our applications. Essentially, it affords you the opportunity to write algorithms\nthat find other algorithms that exhibit a certain behavior. Although searching a space of algorithms is not\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n83\n\nComputational Tectonics\nintended to be the topic of this paper, it will be discussed briefly because, on\nlarge rule sets, it will be necessary to work this way.\nFor example, one desired property of a system might be to find rules that give\ndrastically different behavior when they are run from different initial conditions.\nIn the rule space shown below (fig. 1), we find that rule 6 exhibits this behavior.\nOn simple systems such as these, we can locate this behavior visually;\nhowever, on complex systems containing thousands of rules, this is not always\npossible. In this case, a simple program can be written that runs each rule on a\nvariety of initial conditions and that measures the entropy in each system. The\nrules that show the most varied output are selected for more detailed visual\nanalysis. Figure 1 and figure 2 are both plots of the same 1⁄2-radius rule space:\nfigure 1 is calculated from a random initial condition; figure 2, from a single\nblack cell against a white background. Rule 6, highlighted in red, shows that it\nis capable of both periodic and random behavior.\nIt becomes possible to apply this methodology to construction when we\nconstruct a formal/geometric language for encoding these binary digits.\nBecause they are symbolic and discrete systems, they can be encoded quite\nsimply as a series of lock-and-key mechanisms. The following section will\ndiscuss a method for encoding these systems geometrically.\n\n3 Case Study: “Loki-Blocks”\nWhen designing “Loki-Blocks” the objective was to create a material system\ncapable of producing a variety of complex organizations that could also be\nassembled to specification without complex instructions. In short, the goal was to create a connection that was selfstructuring in the same way that a cellular automaton is self-organizing. In a typical approach to tectonics, one set of\nconnections produces only one configuration. We wanted the same product to produce both periodic and random\nbehaviors.\n\nFigure 2 All 1⁄2 radius\ntwo color rules from an\ninitial condition of one\nblack cell\n\n“Loki-Blocks” is a project that attempts to solve this problem in two dimensions. Running bond brick patterns produce\nthe same neighborhoods we have seen in the 1⁄2-radius cellular automatons discussed above. Each brick on the\nsuccessive lines rests on two bricks in the previous level. The top brick will only exist if we have two beneath it. Figure 3\nshows how these two units can be assembled in a method similar to the running bond brick patterns discussed above.\nFigures 4 and 5 show two sample units used in this material system. Note the similarity of interlocking connections at\nthe top and bottom; this feature will be discussed in a following section.\n\nFigure 3 Rendering of\n“Loki-Block” Assemblage\n\nIn traditional masonry construction, these elements are simply stacked on top of one another. However, if a series of\nmale/female interlocking connections were installed on the top and bottom, restricting the possibilities of the installer,\nwe could evoke some of the same behaviors exhibited by a cellular automaton, including what is known as universality.\nComputational universality is the ability for a system to emulate the behavior of any other computational system. In\ntheory, this research could lead to the development of a universal tectonic.\n\n84\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nComputational Tectonics\n3.1 Connection Geometry\nThis portion of the paper will discuss a few design guidelines for\ndetermining the geometry of the interlocking connections. It is not the\nintention of this paper to define absolute principles for determining\nthese geometries. However, in conducting this research, a number\nof guidelines have emerged that seem to be intrinsic to developing\ngeometries capable of simulating the types of systems discussed in this\npaper.\nThe methodology outlined here revolves around the design of a single\ninterlocking mechanism that can be reconfigured to produce a set\nof “states” similar to those used by a cellular automaton. This design\nmethodology assumes the designer is working with traditional static\nbuilding materials and not shape-memory alloys or plastics that can be\nprogrammed to perform deformations. As a result, we will use rotation,\na simple geometric transformation, that can be carried out in physical\nspace. If we rely on the rotation of the part in space to transform the\ngeometry of the connection, we can design each connection with “x”\nnumber of symmetrical axis to produce the different states.\n\nFigure 4 Unit one\nfrom “Loki-Block”\nAssemblage\nFigure 5 Unit two\nfrom “Loki-Block”\nAssemblage\n\nWe can encode a binary system in the following manner, using rotation\nas a primary means of geometric transformation. The number of different\nstates in a system equals the number of asymmetrical axes contained in\nthe geometry. For example, a circle is symmetrical on all axes. A circle\nwould be used for a system with one state; a half circle can be rotated\n180 degrees and give us two possible states. Figure 6 shows a plan view of the connections generated for “Loki-Blocks.”\nThe shape outlined in figure 6 utilizes a half circle with a line in the center of the flat portion. This shape is symmetrical\nabout the Y-axis but not the X. Applying a 180-degree rotation transforms the geometry into the other state. The degree\nof rotation required to change into each state can be calculated by dividing 360 by the number of states. For example, in\nthis rule with two states, we divide 360/2 and get 180.\nWe can then enumerate all the female connections as shown in figure 6; these are the elongated figures in the center of\nthe block. These will be the connections where the two halves are already joined together. We end up with a total of four\n{1,1},{1,2},{2,1},{2,2}. This number tells us the maximum number of blocks that will be required to accommodate all the\ndifferent connection types. The sizes of these elements are determined by the neighborhood size. With a radius of 1, we\nwill aggregate the unit in arrays of three as opposed to the two shown in this example with a 1⁄2 radius. Essentially, you\nwant to create a whole that is divisible by the number of parts defined by the neighborhood size so that the figure can be\nreconstructed when the other units are adjacent to each other.\n\nFigure 6 “Loki-Block”\nPlan drawings of\nconnection types\n\nThe actual number of blocks required can be calculated by finding arrays of the same value, for example, {1,1} or\n{0,0}. In order to calculate the number of blocks that can be consolidated, you need to identify what shall be called\ntransformable pairs. It is necessary to identify formations capable of transforming into other formations so that we can\nminimize the amount of material being used and reduce the ability for human error. As a result, we need to define\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n85\n\nComputational Tectonics\ntransformation rules for each state in the system. For example, 0=1 and 1=0 when a rotation of 180 degrees is applied.\n{0,1}={1,0} is not a transformable pair because the geometry is asymmetrical on two axis, and it would have to be\nmirrored to take on the state of its sister geometry. However, {0,0}={1,1} is a transformable pair. For arrays longer than\ntwo, we need to search for symmetrical distributions of values. For example, in an automaton with a radius of 1, {1,0,1}\nor {0,0,0} could be coupled with {0,1,0} and {1,1,1}. Rotating the entire piece 180 degrees transforms these cell types\ninto one another. The left-most connection type in figure 6 demonstrates this property. In this case study, we have one\ntransformable pair and, therefore, will need three blocks.\nThe enumeration process will define the geometry at the ends of the blocks. In calculating all the possible rules, it\nis necessary that we calculate the distribution of geometry at the ends of the blocks. In section 4, this process will\nbe discussed in detail. These elements are variable and are used to generate different types of behavior. The center\ngeometry is fixed and is used in every case. The center geometry represents all the possible resulting neighborhood\nconfigurations. In the end, we can create a computer program or use parametric modeling applications to visualize the\ndesign of all the connections, and generate a diagrammatic representation of its behavior.\n\n4 Enumerating “Loki-Blocks”\n“Loki-Blocks” was conceived as a vertically stacking wall assembly. When designing the connections for “Loki-Blocks,”\nfirst the stacking method was determined. After establishing a method of assembly, it was possible to determine a\nneighborhood size by counting the number of adjacent cells. In the case of “Loki-Blocks,” a method of assembly was\nchosen where one block would be placed on top of two other adjacent blocks. The center of one block would always\nbe plugged into the edges of two others. It is necessary that our connection result in a rule that looks something like this:\n{i,j}=x. Using a rule like this, we could simulate the aggregation of blocks that would take place during the construction\nprocess. Given i and j, we can design two distinctive geometries that will be represented by these symbols. The logic\nbehind the construction of this geometry has been outlined in section 3.1. We can then use the enumeration technique\ndiscussed in section 2 to construct all the possible configurations; as a result, we end up with four configurations\n{i,i},{i,j},{j,i},{j,j}.\nEnumerating all the rules requires that we know both the number of modules in the physical system of parts and the\nnumber of neighbors that will be evaluated. We know from previous sections that our physical system works with a\nneighborhood of two cells; and we established the actual number of blocks by determining the number of transformable\npairs in section 3. To summarize, our material system contains three blocks and builds on top of a neighborhood\ncontaining two cells, each with two possible states. In order to calculate all the necessary permutations for these end\nconditions, we will calculate all the possible combinations of the available neighborhoods (discussed in the following\nparagraph), using an array with three spaces because we have three blocks. For example, {i,i},{i,j},{j,i} or {i,j},{j,i},{j,j},\netc. As shown by tables 5 and 6, we have 64 combinations that can be used for the design of our male connections.\nThe software for this project was written using Mathematica from Wolfram Research as a development environment.\nTable 5 shows the code used to enumerate all the pairs. “Tuples” is a function that allows us to enumerate all the\npossible configurations of a particular set. Table 6 contains all the possible male connection types for the geometry that\nwas calculated using the code in table 5.\nTable 5: Enumeration Pseudo Code\nX= Tuples[{1,2},2]\nX= {{1,1},{1,2},{2,1},{2,2}}\nTuples[x,3] = All possible male connection types\nTable 6: Enumeration of all possible male connection types (Tuples[x,3])\n{{1,1},{1,1},{1,1}},\n{{1,1},{1,1},{2,1}},\n{{1,1},{1,2},{1,1}},\n{{1,1},{1,2},{2,1}},\n{{1,1},{2,1},{1,1}},\n{{1,1},{2,1},{2,1}},\n{{1,1},{2,2},{1,1}},\n{{1,1},{2,2},{2,1}},\n{{1,2},{1,1},{1,1}},\n{{1,2},{1,1},{2,1}},\n{{1,2},{1,2},{1,1}},\n{{1,2},{1,2},{2,1}},\n{{1,2},{2,1},{1,1}},\n{{1,2},{2,1},{2,1}},\n{{1,2},{2,2},{1,1}},\n{{1,2},{2,2},{2,1}},\n\n86\n\n{{1,1},{1,1},{1,2}},\n{{1,1},{1,1},{2,2}},\n{{1,1},{1,2},{1,2}},\n{{1,1},{1,2},{2,2}},\n{{1,1},{2,1},{1,2}},\n{{1,1},{2,1},{2,2}},\n{{1,1},{2,2},{1,2}},\n{{1,1},{2,2},{2,2}},\n{{1,2},{1,1},{1,2}},\n{{1,2},{1,1},{2,2}},\n{{1,2},{1,2},{1,2}},\n{{1,2},{1,2},{2,2}},\n{{1,2},{2,1},{1,2}},\n{{1,2},{2,1},{2,2}},\n{{1,2},{2,2},{1,2}},\n{{1,2},{2,2},{2,2}},\n\n{{2,1},{1,1},{1,1}},\n{{2,1},{1,1},{2,1}},\n{{2,2},{2,1},{2,1}},\n{{2,2},{2,2},{1,1}},\n{{2,2},{2,2},{2,1}},\n{{2,1},{1,1},{2,2}},\n{{2,1},{1,2},{1,2}},\n{{2,1},{1,2},{2,2}},\n{{2,1},{2,1},{1,2}},\n{{2,1},{2,1},{2,2}},\n{{2,1},{2,2},{1,2}},\n{{2,1},{2,2},{2,2}},\n{{2,2},{1,1},{1,2}},\n{{2,2},{1,1},{2,2}},\n{{2,2},{1,2},{1,2}},\n{{2,2},{1,2},{2,2}},\n\n{{2,1},{1,1},{1,2}},\n{{2,2},{2,1},{1,2}},\n{{2,2},{2,1},{2,2}},\n{{2,2},{2,2},{1,2}},\n{{2,2},{2,2},{2,2}},\n{{2,1},{1,2},{1,1}},\n{{2,1},{1,2},{2,1}},\n{{2,1},{2,1},{1,1}},\n{{2,1},{2,1},{2,1}},\n{{2,1},{2,2},{1,1}},\n{{2,1},{2,2},{2,1}},\n{{2,2},{1,1},{1,1}},\n{{2,2},{1,1},{2,1}},\n{{2,2},{1,2},{1,1}},\n{{2,2},{1,2},{2,1}},\n{{2,2},{2,1},{1,1}},\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nComputational Tectonics\nThis calculation enumerates all the male connection types possible on each of the three blocks. However, one of these\nblocks contains a transformable pair, discussed in section 3.1. In order to construct a complete rule table, you need\nto know all the possible states at any given point in time. It will be necessary to write a function that can give us the\nalternate state of each transformable pair. The function in table 7 duplicates the transformable pair and replaces each\nbinary state with its opposite, 1=0 and 0=1.

For example, block one is adjacent to block four; see\nfigure 6 in section 3.1 for the block numbering. The output from this\ncalculation will be used to tell us what happens when two of these blocks are put side by side.\nTable 9: Enumerating possible adjacencies\ny= Tuples[{1,2,3,4},2]\ny={{1,1},{1,2},{1,3},{1,4},{2,1},{2,2},{2,3},{2,4},{3,1},{3,2},{3,3},{3,4},{4,1},{4,2},{4,3},{4,4}}\nThe resulting array is then used with the output shown in table 8 to provide the resulting neighborhood configurations for\neach of the possible sixteen adjacencies described in table 9. For example, table 8 has four pairs of values per entry.\nThese represent the left and right male connection for each block. If we take the second value in variable y, shown in\ntable 9, {1,2}. We can use this value to figure out that when block one and block two are next to each other, and we\nare using rule 17, block number three will be placed on the next row. Rule 17 is the seventeenth entry in table 8 and\nrequires the following set of male connections, {1,2},{1,2},{1,1},{1,1}. Block one and two are both {1,2}. To find the\nresulting connection type by placing these two blocks side by side, we take the right-most value from block one and\nthe left-most value from block two, and we end up with a neighborhood configuration of {2,1}. Then, because all the\nfemale connections are static, we can use the following replacement rule to calculate which blocks will be used with\nwhich neighborhood configuration. Using this transformation logic, rule 17, which looks like this {1,2},{1,2},{1,1},{1,1},\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n87\n\nComputational Tectonics\nbecomes a sixteen-value array like this {2,1}, {2,1}, {2,1}, {2,1}, {2,1}, {2,1}, {2,1}, {2,1}, {1,1},\n{1,1}, {1,1}, {1,1}, {1,1}, {1,1}, {1,1}, {1,1}.\nThe rule in this application looks like this: {1,1}=1,{1,2}=4,{2,1}=3,{2,2}=2. These arrays of\nnumbers represent the two male connections that construct a neighborhood and the resulting\nfemale connection on the following row. The resulting neighborhood of {2,1} that we calculated in\nour above example will have block 3 on the next row above it {2,1}=3. We repeat this action for all\nthe rules calculated in table 8 and store them in one array. Each entry in the array will look something\nlike this: {2,1}=3, {2,1}=3, {2,1}=3, {2,1}=3, {2,1}=3, {2,1}=3, {2,1}=3, {2,1}=3, {1,1}=1, {1,1}=1,\n{1,1}=1, {1,1}=1, {1,1}=1, {1,1}=1, {1,1}=1, {1,1}=1. Table 10 outlines how these rules are\nconstructed, and figure 8 shows the behavior of all 64 possible rules. This replacement rule is now\nan algorithm that we can use to digitally simulate the construction sequence, and to study the entire\nspace of possibilities for configurations that might display interesting or even universal properties.\nTable 10: Enumerating possible adjacencies\nMale Connection Types (rule 17)\n\n{1,2},{1,2},{1,1},{1,1}\n\nAdjacencies\n\n\n{1,1},{1,2},{1,3},{1,4},{2,1},{2,2},{2,3},{2,4},{3,1},\n{3,2},{3,3},{3,4},{4,1},{4,2},{4,3},{4,4}\n\nResulting Neighborhoods\n\n\n{2,1},{2,1},{2,1},{2,1},{2,1},{2,1},{2,1},{2,1},{1,1},\n{1,1},{1,1},{1,1},{1,1},{1,1},{1,1},{1,1}\n\nFemale Connections Types and\ncorresponding adjacency\n\n{1,1}=1,{1,2}=4,{2,1}=3,{2,2}=2\n\nResulting Algorithm for digital\nconstruction simulation\n\n\n{2,1}=3,{2,1}=3,{2,1}=3,{2,1}=3,{2,1}=3,{2,1}=3,\n{2,1}=3, {2,1}=3,{1,1}=1,{1,1}=1,{1,1}=1,{1,1}=1,\n{1,1}=1,{1,1}=1, {1,1}=1,{1,1}=1}\n\nWe can then export these arrays into parametric modeling software to generate the following\ndrawings of the necessary connections that will generate the desired material algorithm.

This research also shows us that it is possible to develop what has been termed a “tectonic computer”\nthat is capable of transforming an assembly into a series of self-structuring accumulations, developed by a series of\nlocal decisions made by the builder. This process reduces the need for complex instructions about the assembly by\napplying a game-like methodology to construction.\nFurther developments of this research will include applications to three-dimensional structural systems, and will expand\non two-dimensional systems. By transforming building components into bits of computer code, it is important that we\nconsider what this means for the economy of building. The architecture becomes more about the product and the end\nuser, rather then the whole composition.\nDeveloping material systems such as these free architecture from the printed page by recording our design intent in\nthe components of buildings themselves, and can begin to move architecture towards a more “open source” model of\ndevelopment. It might be possible to create high-level programming languages or a markup language for construction\nusing the logics outlined in this paper, allowing architecture, as well as construction techniques, to evolve and be\nshared more freely in a digital environment.\n\nRefErences\nANZALONE, PHILLIP, AND CORY CLARKE. “ARCHITECTURAL APPLICATIONS OF COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS.” PROCEEDINGS OF THE\n2003 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN IN ARCHITECTURE (OCTOBER 27, 2003): 325–35.\nGIPS, JAMES.

The design\nand construction were carried out in an academic context that was displayed to a public audience of approximately\n200,000 people over the course of three days. In addressing the performance parameters of the prototype, the concept\nfocused on several key strategies: 1) geometry 2) movement 3) connections 4) scale and 5) computational control, and\nhuman interaction. The final objective of the approach was to create an innovative design that was a minimally functional\nspatial environment with the capability for evolving additional multi-functionality. Heavy emphasis was placed on creating\na full-scale environment that a person could walk through, interact with, and experience spatially.\n\n1 Introduction\nAlthough today, we are surrounded by smart and networked architectural devices and appliances, they are not\nconsidered from and architectural point of view in terms how and when they are used and how they work together.\nInteractive architecture in general is built on the convergence of embedded computation (intelligence) and a physical\ncounterpart (kinetics) that satisfies adaptation within the contextual framework of human and environmental interaction.\nThe combination of these two areas will allow an environment to have the ability to reconfigure itself and automate\nphysical change to respond, react, adapt, and be interactive. The inherent sensing, processing, and output are now\nbeginning to be taken out of the computer and are instead, embedded in the objects of everyday life themselves.\nThe individual devices therefore have a remarkable ability to communicate with each other even while being specifically\ntask oriented. Decentralization then is a powerful control strategy for such systems of individually networked devices\n(in this case) whereby there is no central control system, and consequentially, the more the system relies on lateral\nrelationships, the less it can rely on overall commands. When such a structure is applied to a large system, there is\na potential for emergent behavior. An emergent behavior can occur when a number of simple systems operate in an\nenvironment that forms more complex behaviors as a collective.\n\n2 The Future of Robotics in Architecture\nWe must change our preconceptions of interactive architecture to understand the potential role of robotics in architecture\nwith respect to decentralized control. To illustrate, we will use the example of a smart kitchen with an “intelligent”\nmechanical counter top which can raise and lower itself when needed and a smart cabinet above which can assist\nyou in retrieving food items as desired. Both the countertop and the cabinet understand the actions of each other and\nwhile only one may deduce a response based on environmental sensing, the other may operate accordingly based on\nthe actions of the other device. For example, as the countertop senses the height of an individual it may lower itself to\naccommodate a specific food preparation need, and the cabinet will use the information of the countertops’ action and\nlower itself and organize the food items accordingly to a learned pattern of behavior of what the person typically eats\nat a specific time of day.\nThe above scenario, while perhaps not commonplace, is very realistic and achievable by today’s technological means.\nWe will expand the scenario further now by imagining that both the countertop and the cabinetry are not mechanically\ndriven “devices” but are rather composed of thousands of smaller mechanical modules (the size of dice) which make up\n\n90\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nFlockwall: A Full-Scale Spatial Environment with Discrete\nCollaborative Modules\nthe devices themselves. The distributed sensing and control would now happen not at the level of the countertop and\nthe cabinetry but at the level of each of the tiny modules. The geometrical flexibility, sensing capabilities and robustness\nof each of the larger “devices” would then be greatly enhanced.\nLet us then extend the example above whereby the countertop and the cabinet are not composed of small modules\nbut are composed of bionanotechnological materials which can morph their shapes to adapt at a very high degree\nof resolution. The materials are not veneers to traditional devices but are the fabric of the devices themselves with\nsensing and control operating biomimetically at a very small scale. At this level the countertop and cabinet can control\nadditional attributes such as temperature, texture, color, opacity, etc. These new interactive assembly systems will bring\nnew unprecedented levels of customization and reconfigurability to the architectural palette. Such an extrapolation of\nadvancements in both robotics and new materials demonstrates an architectural future whereby adaptation becomes\nmuch more holistic and operates on a very small internal scale (Fox 2009).\n\n3 the Changing Face of Robotics\nDesigners are moving away from traditional uses of automated mechanical devices in architecture to systems that are\nmade up of a number of small robots. For many applications ranging from cleaning carpets and windows to adjustable\nfurniture, we are seeing a distancing from the precedent of figural humanoid robots to transformable discrete systems.\nMost architectural applications are neither self-organizing nor do they have higher level intelligence functions of heuristic\nand symbolic decision-making abilities. Most applications or “devices” in architecture do however exhibit a behavior\nbased on low-level intelligence functions of automatic response and communication.\nWe propose that new interactive assembly systems will bring new unprecedented levels of customization and\nreconfigurability to the architectural palette. It is then an architectural question as to how these pieces should come\ntogether and how these configurations will respond to the constant flow of information between inhabitants and space;\nto re-envision the creation of dynamic space.\nWhen a large architectural space is responding to a single element, then a centralized system can be effective in\nexecuting a command to a single agent, but when there are many unknown stimuli such as groups of individuals\nbehaving in unknown ways and an exterior environment which is constantly changing, then decentralized intelligence\ncan be a very effective way to handle the sensing and response (perception and action). The beauty of this when\napplied to a large system is the emergent behavior. Although there may be no centralized control structure dictating how\nindividual parts of a system should behave, local interactions between individual modules can lead to the emergence of\nglobal behavior. There are many biological reasons for swarm behavior related to efficiency in foraging, hydrodynamics\nand aerodynamics, protection and reproduction, among others. An emergent behavior can occur when a number of\nsimple systems operate in an environment that forms more complex behaviors as a collective. The rules of response\ncan be very simple and the rules for interaction between each system can be very simple but the combination can\nproduce interactions that become emergent and very difficult to predict. The more decentralized a system is, the more\nit relies on lateral relationships, and the less it can rely on overall commands.\nSince it will be possible to build space out of parts that have the ability to reconfigure themselves, it will be up to\narchitects and designers to design how these pieces will come together and how these configurations will respond\nto the constant flow of information between inhabitant and space. As architects and designers begin to adopt the\ntechnology of modular reconfigurable robotic systems, they will begin to re-envision the creation of dynamic space.\nArchitects in the future may design an architectural environment composed of a palate of autonomous reconfigurable\nparts. These materials come together to create a layering of responsiveness and an overall intelligence that is embedded\nin the structure itself; the material and texture of the space is the intelligence of the space.\nIn the near future, modular reconfigurable space will hugely impact the way people live in space, and the relationships\nbetween users and the space itself. Our furniture and entire spaces might someday be comprised of a multitude of\ninterconnected assemblies of robotic modules that can reconfigure themselves for a variety of needs or desires. How\nsuch systems in our everyday buildings affect our behaviors and change our behaviors are the issues that architects\nwill be forced to confront in the near future. Only when architects confront these scenarios of interaction and construct\nactual environments will they truly take an active role in the larger dialogue of where the technology is going and what\nit will mean to everyone.\n\n4 Flockwall: Background and Problem Definition\nThe challenge proposed was to work collaboratively to design and construct a full-scale environment composed of\nnumerous discrete autonomous parts. The prototype environment was to be comprised generally of self-similar\nrobotic modules. The goal for each module was to move autonomously with 3 degrees of freedom (X, Y and Z).\nThe physical prototype was valuable for several reasons: 1) It serves as a vehicle for exploring strategies for\ndecentralized control, dictating how individual parts of a collective system could behave. 2) It will serve to demonstrate\nthe possibilities of architectural space-making with unprecedented levels of customization and adaptability.\nThe final environment is innovative for two reasons: 1) Operating at an architectural scale that allowed for natural human\ninteractions, and 2) introducing an additional degree of freedom from what has knowingly been constructed in the past.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n91\n\nFlockwall: A Full-Scale Spatial Environment with Discrete\nCollaborative Modules\nThe design and construction was carried out in an academic context that was displayed to a public audience of\napproximately 200,000 people over the course of three days. It is important to mention that time was a valuable\ncommodity and the entire design process, prototyping, fabrication and construction was carried out in 10 weeks. The\nobjectives for the course were general and aimed at developing the skills to explore, and design interactive architectural\nenvironments. They included: 1) Learning hands-on robotics for connecting circuits, sensors and motors to kinetic\nstructures. 2) Understanding interactive principles through comprehensive precedent studies. 3) Understanding\ncontextual situations for applications of robotic architectural solutions. 4) Learning basic mechanical and technological\nprinciples of kinetic design 5) Understanding contemporary ideologies of interactive design. 6) Understanding the\npotential to build robotics into systems that make up architectural space. 7) Prototyping a system that can demonstrate\n(as opposed to simulate) design intention.\n\n4.1 Definition of Technical Objectives\nIn addressing the performance parameters of the prototype, the concept focused on several key strategies:\n1) geometry, 2) movement, 3) connections, 4) scale, 5) computational control, and 6) human interaction. The overall\nobjective of the approach was to create an innovative design that was minimally functional with the capability for evolving\nadditional multi-functionality.\n\n4.2 A Collaborative and Multi-disciplinary Design Process\nDesigning interactive architecture is not inventing, but appreciating and marshalling the technology that exists, and\nextrapolating it to suit an architectural vision. There are many important lessons to be learned in both distributed\ncomputation and small-scale robotics that can feed into a future paradigm of architectural space-making. Students\nwere provided with various lectures on kinetic and mechanical design, computational control and distributed intelligence\nand modular robotics. These lectures served as an important foundation for architectural explorations in designing and\nevaluating the system strategically to facilitate dynamic situational activities and explicitly understand the potential to\nbuild them into systems that make up architectural space.\n\n4.3 Geometric Explorations Relative to Spatial Experience\nInitially numerous collaborative brainstorming sessions were carried out that focused on the scale of the environment,\nthe types of human interactions and the scale of the modules. The design process moved forward with individual\ndesign proposals on a number of issues such as the module design, the number of modules, spatial configurations,\nmovement, etc. Specific design proposals were then voted on and winning proposals in each area were\nquickly developed.\nPrimarily the geometric explorations focused on how the modules could combine with each other to make a surface or\ncollaborative forms and the objectives of dynamic space-making. The type of flocking behavior that was desired and\ncould be achieved was also explored. A matrix of various geometries was explored which would satisfy the objectives\nof movement, connection and scale.\n\n4.4 Module Design\nIt was decided that the scale of the prototype should consist of modules which are approximately 12 inches by 12\ninches primarily as a means to realize the objectives of scale from an architectural and human standpoint within a limited\namount of time and money. The initial scale was also based on the size of the necessary mechanical parts that will be\nin each module. Conceptually, the project will feed into a biological paradigm of architectural space-making, which will\nmost certainly involve reexamining and adjusting the scale of such modular parts.\n\nFigure 1 Example of a\ndesired surface (left) and\nexplorations in swarm\nbehavior (right)\n\n92\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nFlockwall: A Full-Scale Spatial Environment with Discrete\nCollaborative Modules\n4.5 Flockwall: Supporting Structure\nOnce the scale and geometry of the module was developed the type of space-making possibilities necessitated an\nintegrated approach for the structure that would support the modules. This structure also fed into the ways and means\nof movement that could facilitate the overall spatial objectives. The support structure was explored collaboratively and in\nparallel through another course with a different lead instructor. The primary objectives were in the area of digital modeling\nprocedures of complex geometries under the use of parametric design methods and automated output in form of rapid\nprototyping. The entire structure was water-jet cut from aluminum and hand assembled by means of snapping the\npieces together.\nFigure 2 CNC milled\nmodule variations (left)\nand the chosen design\n(right)\n\nFigure 3 Variations in\nstructure geometry (left)\nand full-scale\nprototype (right)\n\nFigure 4 Variations in\nstructure geometry (left)\nand full-scale prototype\n(right)\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n93\n\nFlockwall: A Full-Scale Spatial Environment with Discrete\nCollaborative Modules\n4.6 Module Development\nThe design process was implemented from an architectural (as opposed to engineering) standpoint. The final module\nassemblies were extrapolated to simulate various architectural applications of space-making. This aspect is unique\nfrom engineering approaches to modular robotics in speculating how such an approach to adaptive space-making\ncan be applied in realistic situations. The modules did have several real constraints that had to be considered in\nthe development including: 1) Weight 2) Power 3) Lighting, and 4) Mechanics. It was important that each module\nhad self-contained lighting for which 2700MA batteries were used to power three LED lights for up to 15 hours at at\ntime. It was also important that each module could be opened quickly like a clamshell to repair mechanical problems\nand change batteries. With these issues in mind the module was formed out of two lightweight shells of plastic.\nOnce a final CNC was made a negative PVC mold was created from which hundreds of the final shells could be\nvacuum-formed.\n\nFigure 5 Module\nwiring (left) and\nmass-production\nand assembly (right)\n\n4.7 Mechanical Development\nEach module was connected to a track made of 80 pound fishing line and a pulling line that went to a take-up reel on\na servo to collect the filament. A 32 pound torque servo was used and many variations of spool sizes were explored to\nfind a correct match of desired speed and strength. All of the servo mounts were then designed and milled from solid\nPVC to bolt to the supporting structure.\n\n94\n\nFigure 6 Architectural\napplications of spacemaking with modular\nrobotics\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nFlockwall: A Full-Scale Spatial Environment with Discrete\nCollaborative Modules\n4.8 Design of the Base\nThe base was very important in that the modules were to be fixed to the structure above but have two degrees of\nmovement at the base. It was decided that this movement be prescribed to a certain extent by cutting “paths” in\nthe base that the module track would follow. The base was constructed of typical wood framing with a top layer of\nHDPE. The “tracks” were then affixed to a 1/8” rod of polypropelene which ran in the HDPE “tracks”. The tracks then\nmoved in a straight line in one direction and were forced to move sideways in the other direction by the grooves cut\ninto the base.\nFigure 7 The full base\nassembled on site (left)\nThe base with shadows of\nthe structure.\n\n4.9 Computational Control\n\nFigure 8 Wiring on site\n(left) Nighttime wiring\non site of 56 modules\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nThe control was carried out by means of a custom interface written in JAVA which controlled each pair of servos\n(per module). The software allowed us to generate different flocking behaviors within the context of the structure and\naccommodated choreography of each of the 56 servo motors. The software will also allow for our future objectives of\nelaborating on scenarios of discrete modules creating architectural space. Initially each servo was set to limits related\nto the specific length of the path that it would follow. Each of the vertical and horizontal paths had differing limits. Once\nthe limits were set we could initialize the system to have all of the flock-bots set at a zero position which was down and\nto the left. This enabled us to reset the system and to initiate a choreographed setting. The program would allow each\nflock-bot to move according to it’s neighbors movement. As a system this allowed us to simulate good flocking behavior\nwith limited sensing. The behavior then is controlled computationally but cannot therefore detect localized interference.\nAn analogy might be a flock of birds navigating around a pole; although the first bird could avoid the pole the entire flock\nmight not clear the obstacle. The system is set up for us to experiment further with a second level of control whereby\neach flock-bot has sensing capability and can therefore have more localized control.\n\n95\n\nFlockwall: A Full-Scale Spatial Environment with Discrete\nCollaborative Modules\n4.10 Installation\nThe installation was completed in two days with the exhibit running for three days. It was displayed to a public audience\nof approximately 200,000 people over the course of three days. Almost all of the visitors walked through the exhibit\nand stood in the center for a period of time to understand the behavior. While it was not clear what the flock-bots were\nresponding to it was clear that they were moving with intent when a visitor passed through the environment. The\ninitial goal of flock-bots clustering around an individual was not as clear as we had intended due to the speed of the\nbots (which was limited because of motor torque) and also because of the unanticipated massive crowds of people\nwho visited the exhibit. Most of the time there was a steady line of people walking through the environment and the\nexperience was rushed to the extent that the bots never completed a motion before a new instruction was given\nto them. This caused the flock-bots to hover around the center. In the end we initiated a choreographed behavior\ndemonstrating a full range of movement that was much more successful experientially but was not true to our design\nintents because it was disconnected from individual users passing through the space.\nFigure 9 View of the final\nexhibit at night\n\nFigure 10 Two views of\nthe final exhibit at night\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we were successful in obtaining all of the general and technical objectives of this project. The dynamic\nenvironment was a terrific and has the potential to be easily be developed further in terms of space-making scenarios.\nSuch real-world prototypes that must withstand extremely robust conditions are very important in the development of\ninteractive architecture from a standpoint of real human interactions. In terms of future development, the possibilities\nof this environment are limited by two important concerns. The first is that a supporting structure was needed at all.\nA clear vision of such an environment would not need such a structure or the three-dimensional “paths” that we\nprovided for the modules. The second issue is that of scale. The future of interactive architecture will most certainly\ninvolve re-examining and adjusting the scale of individual modules. As physical robotic parts scale down, it will become\nincreasingly possible for future systems to be built out of nanotechnological, and bionanotechnological means. Such\nnew interactive assembly systems will bring new unprecedented levels of customization and reconfigurability.\n\n96\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nFlockwall: A Full-Scale Spatial Environment with Discrete\nCollaborative Modules\nAcknowledgments\nThis project was made possible by the generous support of the following Grants:\nResearch, Scholarship and Creative Activities (RSCA) Grant\nCoachella Valley Music and Arts Festival Exhibit Grant\nPresidential Travel Grant (Cal Poly Pomona)\nMini Grant for Professional Development (Cal Poly Pomona)\nI would like to thank the expert consultants on the modular robotics design studio including Darius Miller and\nDr. Phyllis Nelson, and Professor Axel Schmitzberger.

It is a distributed interface,\nmeaning that different parts of an ArtBus system can be at different locations in a space. ArtBus devices can be made\non any embedded platform or microcontroller. While unconventional in some ways, ArtBus makes use of engineering\ndesign inspired by long established supervisory control and laboratory instrumentation practice. At the same time it is\na simple, flexible interface which should be viable into the next generation of media devices and embedded control.\n\n1 Introduction\nSensible phenomena, information, and dynamic objects give structure to reactive art and design. Sensor input,\nintelligent controllers, and mechanical actuators can be combined in various ways to create an experience for a viewer\nor a client. The fundamental basis of joining the worlds of information and material phenomena is interfacing. The ArtBus\nsystem is formed at the convergence of a general purpose laboratory interface board, the concept of a two-wire digital\ndata channel from the electric power industry, and a protocol derived from an earlier interface device. Understanding\nthe history of these systems is important because, in interfacing, there is a finite number of related concepts in play, and\nnew ones are not added often. Juxtaposition of selected concepts will define new interface systems, like the ArtBus.\n\n2 Hardware Interfaces\n2.1 Interface Definition and Function\nSensors are input devices that convert parameters such as light level, force, pressure, distance, and temperature into\nelectrical signals. Dynamic objects consist of output devices such as a lamp or a load driven by an actuator. These\ndevices become points of system input/output, i/o, when accessed by a computer through a signal-to-data interface.\nIn the context of this discussion, the word interface as used in art, design, and allied fields means the hardware just\ndescribed and any essential companion software.\n\n2.2 Description of a Generic Interface\nMost interface devices used in art take the form of raw circuit boards of 2 to 36 square inches in size. The boards\nare designed to provide i/o that makes connecting computers and dynamic objects as quick and easy as possible.\nExamples are the EZIO, ArtBus, Arduino (when used as an interface), the Wiring board, the Make controller, and the\nPicoboard. There are others. It is possible to describe a generic interface, which, if not an exact description of a\nparticular device, can serve as a point of departure for consideration of specific types. There are eight elements in a\ngeneric interface when applied to a task.\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\n98\n\nThe host computer running the end-user program (e.g. Processing).\nA an adapter with Windows, Mac, or Linux drivers necessary to format data to pass through the interface cable.\nThe wire connecting the computer and the interface.\nA data bus voltage to MCU voltage converter on the node device.\nThe device node microcontroller that formats the data from the sensors and to the actuators connected to the\noutside world.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nArtBus: A Minimal Bus and Protocol for Distributed\nInterfacing in Art and Design\n\nFigure 1 A\ngeneric Interface\n\n•\n•\n\nPower drivers and signal conditioners for final connection to the load or sensor. These circuit elements may be\nhighly specific to a particular sensor or load, and are sometimes hand-built by the user.\nThe actual sensor or actuator.\n\nThe eighth element is not shown on the diagram. It is the protocol (a sort of data format) which the host and the\nmicrocontroller use to pass data back and forth. Protocols are discussed in section 4.\n\n3 Survey of Interfaces and Buses\nInterfacing sensible phenomena and dynamic objects to a point of intelligent control is not a new problem. The\nparadigm of addressable device nodes sharing a common data channel was well formed by the 1940s and had gelled\nby the middle 1970s. Our task has been to sort through those paradigms in search of a robust, minimal, and easily\nimplemented solution for contemporary interfacing needs.\n\n3.1 Data Conversion\nIn 1975, Hewlett Packard’s General Purpose Interface Bus, GPIB, became an open standard for laboratory device\ninterfacing (Horowitz and Hill, 1989). Up to fifteen laboratory instruments can be daisy-chained to interoperate through\none computer.\nLaboratory instrumentation continued to drive innovation in interfacing. In the late 1980s, National Instruments introduced\na line of Apple-compatible interfaces which were used by at least one artist, Michael Rodemer. The NI boards were\nused in the interactive installations “LifeWalk” in 1993 and “Prairie” in 1996 (Rodemer 2009).\nIn 1996, the EZIO board was designed by Michael Rodemer at the University of Michigan. The concept was\noriginated by Rodemer while an assistant professor at the School of the Art Institute in 1994. His student at that\ntime, Chris Csikszentmihalyi, developed an alpha prototype which was successful enough to redesign and put in\nproduction. Ed Bennett (this author) wrote the firmware for EZIO V1. It was the first general purpose interface board\nintended for use specifically by visual and kinetic artists. The board layout and electrical configuration of the i/o lines\nare consistent with current practice. The EZIO used an RS232 serial port to connect to the computer. It provided ten\ndigital input lines, ten digital output lines, eight analog input lines, and two PWM output lines. The board itself was not\nprogrammable. Commands were a single letter and a number. “A1” reads analog channel 1. The command “w31”\nwrites pin 3 high. The ArtBus protocol modifies and extends the EZIO command set.\n\n3.2 Buses\nA bus is a wired or wireless data channel shared among low-level devices called nodes. Many industries have\nspecialized buses characteristic of their products or manufacturing processes.\nWhat we would now call data buses seem to have appeared in the electric power industry in the 1920s (Shepard, 1929).\nTheir purpose was to facilitate supervisory control (later called SCADA, Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) of\nelectric substations. By the late 1930s all the various equipments in multiple stations could share one daisy chained\nwire pair carrying measurement and control data to and from the dispatcher (the human operator) tens of miles away\n(Boswau 1937). By the late 1940s direct operation of remote substation equipment could be accomplished through a\nkeyboard based text terminal (McWhirter and Ward 1948). Nowadays, the meaning of SCADA has been expanded to\ninclude manufacturing control and building automation systems.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n99\n\nArtBus: A Minimal Bus and Protocol for Distributed\nInterfacing in Art and Design\n4 Protocols\nData on a bus is structured by a protocol. Minimally, a protocol consists of a data format, a way to individually address\neach device on the bus, and a way to know at any given moment which device can speak.\nAutomobiles use a number of different buses to interconnect different systems. In 2004, LINbus was going mainstream\nin the auto industry. ECN magazine discussed the news using this language:\n“... Local Interconnect Network (LIN) was born for low end, low speed applications. This network complements CAN for\nmedium speed, Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) for the high-speed data rates and FlexRay for safety-critical\napplications such as steer- and brake-by-wire.” (Parnell 2004)\nA typical car will, therefore, have four distinct and mutually incompatible data buses connecting different intelligent\ndevices. There are at least eighteen bus architectures which are or have been used in the auto industry (Davis 1998).\nOther industries also use specialized buses and protocols. For building automation, there are BACnet, LonWorks, KNX,\nModbus, and others. Home automation protocols are evolving at a very rapid pace. Many protocols are copyrighted\nand their use may require registration or a fee.\n\n5 Serial Data Transfer and RS485\nSerial data is transferred data one bit at a time through a data channel (wired or wireless). Using a serial terminal\napplication, a user can read and type text carried across a computer’s real or USB-emulated RS232 port. There are\nseveral serial terminal applications free for download. On the Mac, we like GoSerial. On Windows, there is “Bray’s\nterminal”. On Linux there is Cutecom.\nRS485 is a wiring standard used for SCADA and other industrial serial data buses. It provides the “distributed” in the\nArtBus distributed interface. It is easy and cheap to make, yet can run at reasonably high speeds. An RS485 bus\ncable is comprised of a single pair of twisted wires daisy-chained between device nodes. Bus runs of 1200 meters\nare permitted in the specification. Bit rates on RS485 links are normally below 230kbps, but can be 20 megabits\nper second or more (Maxim 2004). Interface designers using RS485 balance speed, distance, number of device\nnodes connected to the bus, and other factors to optimize the data link. RS485 buses are half-duplex, meaning that\ncommunications are bi-directional, with only one device transmitting at a time. A protocol on top of the bus decides\nwhich device can transmit to the bus.\nRS485 buses for host computers are usually derived from RS232 or UART ports through USB. To the host application,\nRS485 looks like a normal UART-based serial port.\n\n6 General Description of InterfaceBoards:\nMicrocontrollers\nEvery small interface board is based on a microcontroller chip. To develop firmware for a given microcontroller, a\ndesigner must have hardware and software development tools specifically for that family of MCU. The best crossplatform, open source development tools for small microcontrollers are for the Atmel 8-bit AVR family. The avr-gcc\ncompiler from the AVR “Super-Project” hosted by the Free Software Foundation forms the core of the development tool\nset. Atmel’s AVR product line offers around 230 different 8-bit microcontrollers, many of which are supported by avrgcc. The AVR family has an intense fan-base among engineers and hobbyists (AVRfreaks.net). A handful of AVR chips\nhave become very popular among artists and designers due in large part to David Mellis’s excellent libraries adapted\nfrom the Wiring project (Wiring.org) to become the center of the Arduino project code base. The current version of\nthe ArtBus hardware is based on the Microchip PIC16F690 microcontroller, but future development will incorporate\nfunctionality from the Wiring/Arduino libraries on the AVR platform.\nInexpensive 32-bit microcontroller modules are becoming available which can run an operating system, have\nfilesystems, include built-in interfaces for special hardware like mini LCD displays, and have large numbers of i/o lines.\nThe ARM Cortex microcontroller is poised to be the basis for the next generation of device controller for artists and\ndesigners, however the programming environment has a very steep learning curve.\n\n7 Rationale for the ArtBus\nEach type of ArtBus device node is intended to be a specific solution to a specific interfacing problem, and can be\ndistributed in multiples through an installation. In any interfacing system however, generic analog input, digital i/o, and\nPWM are obviously first requirements. An MCU containing the protocol provides the bus connection. This approach to\ndevice isomorphism is similar to that of “neuron chip” used with LonWorks.\nIn the case of ArtBus, the application context of the protocol includes an end-user, who is more interested in the\nhost computer application than programming the interface device. As much as possible ArtBus tries to keep all\npoints on the bus congruent by using one text-based communications layer. This gives a high level of functional\n\n100\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nArtBus: A Minimal Bus and Protocol for Distributed\nInterfacing in Art and Design\n\nFigure 2 A Bused\nInterface. Node\n#1 is Typical.\n\ntransparency to the end user. ArtBus devices are not intended to be reprogrammed: ArtBus is not an Arduino\nreplacement. It is not an imitation of Modbus.\nAs an aside, all classically trained computer programmers instinctively wrap protocols in higher level abstractions using\nfunction names that suit their taste. This is absolutely necessary when using normal industrial protocols because of their\nintricacies. A caveat here would be that wrapping the ArtBus protocol would obscure the deliberately simple relationship\nbetween the interface hardware, the bus, and the protocol which makes the system easily extensible.\n\n8 How the Bus/Protocol Works\nThe electrical part of the ArtBus, the bus itself, uses RS485 (section 5). A device node has two four-pin connectors for\ndaisy-chaining. The data bus is the middle pair. A wireless link, using for instance ZigBee modules, could substitute\ninterchangeably for RS485, as in the Breese patent (Breese 1948).\nAll data on the ArtBus is human-readable text. This gives the user the ability to interact directly with the bus in real time\nthrough a serial terminal.\nThe bus master can be made from any serial-capable device, large or small, but usually it is a host computer running\na multi-media application.\nFigure 3 An\nArtBus Node.\n\nIt is implicit in a single-master half-duplex data channel that the master must wait for a device node to reply if a reply to\na command is called for. Not all ArtBus commands generate a reply from the device node. A transaction will time out\nand reset if it doesn’t complete in a few milliseconds.\nThe address of an individual ArtBus device node is a single upper case character\n(“A-Z”). The user can give any device node any address as described in section 9.1,\nbut each address must be unique on the bus.\nThe group address is a way of causing multiple device nodes to execute the same\ncommand at the same time. It is not a hierarchical grouping. “Z” is the default group\naddress. To a device node, there is no difference between its individual address and\nits group address.\nArtBus commands are represented as a single lower-case character. The meaning\nof a specific command, for instance “a”, will be different to different specific types\nof device nodes. This is because different types of device nodes have different\nfunctional purposes.\nThe protocol provides three groups of command types. The first set of commands,\n“a” through “f”, must return a value to the host. The second set of commands, “i”\nthrough “v” do not return values. The third set, commands g, h, w, x, y, and z have\nthe same meaning to every device node. For instance, “z” means reset.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n101\n\nArtBus: A Minimal Bus and Protocol for Distributed\nInterfacing in Art and Design\nAddresses are prefixed with the “!” character. Commands from the\nmaster end with a semicolon, and replies from a device node end\nwith a newline character (the “enter” key, expressed in code as\n“\\n”). Groups of numeric strings are separated by spaces. Normal\ntext strings require no special tags and are delimited in the same\nway as any other data.\nThere is one non-printing character in the protocol. It is the ASCII\nBELL character. It is spoken as “control G”, has the numeric\nvalue 7, and is written “\\a” in code. In the ArtBus protocol the\nBELL character is a tag sent by a device node to keep the host\nfrom interpreting status messages as data. It causes the host to\nindefinitely discard all incoming data. It does not keep the host\nfrom transmitting. Its closing tag is the newline character.\nIn case of an error, a device node turns on its red LED, records\nthen discards the error, then resumes. The exact error can be\nretrieved from the device node with the “x” command.\n\n9 Setup and Operation\n9.1 Assign an Address\nOpening a terminal program and then pressing the setup button\non the node device shows the setup screen in figure 4. All of the text in the window is emitted by the ArtBus node.\nThe setup dialog screen allows the user to permanently set the node address, group address, and baud rate. The\nnode address is usually the only option needing attention. The default group address is Z and the default baud rate is\n115200bps.\n\nFigure 4 Using\nGoSerial to Set\nthe Address of\nan ArtBus Device\nNode.\n\n9.2 Interacting with the ArtBus\nIn an exactly parallel manner, the same terminal session used in section 9.1 can be used to manually send commands\nand receive replies to and from the device node (fig. 5).\nUsage:\nWith no delay between characters, send a bang “!” (an exclamation point), then an address, e.g, ”A,” then a command,\ne.g. “a”, then a parameter (if appropriate) e.g. “1,” then a semicolon. All together this would be: “!Aa1;”, which would\nbe pronounced “bang-A-a-1-semi”.\n\nFigure 5 An\nArtBus Device\nReturning a Value\nof 255.\n\nExamples:\nFor an analog input node, the command to\nread a line is “a”.\nAB_analog at address A, read input 1 and\nreturn the value:\n!Aa1;\nAnalog input 1 is read and a three digit\nASCII string followed by a newline (\\n) is\nreturned. In Processing, getting the value\nof analog channel 1 from board A, then\nputting the value in the variable foo looks\nlike this:\nport.write(“!Aa1;”);\nfoo = getnumeric(‘\\n’);\nOther examples:\nAB_analog at address B,\nreboot: !Bz;\nStop all devices: !Zh;\nAll devices resume: !Zg;\n\n10 The Transmogrifier\nProcessing is fairly easy to code in for\nusing the serial port in the host computer.\nOther languages and platforms are not so\naccommodating. Max/MSP is a graphical\n\n102\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nArtBus: A Minimal Bus and Protocol for Distributed\nInterfacing in Art and Design\nlanguage for doing sound and video synthesis. Max has an internal scheduler which will not work with a speak-whenspoken-to protocol. Adobe Flash has similar issues with real time i/o. Addressing this problem was not trivial.\nRobb Drinkwater of the SAIC Sound department and Matthew C. Nelson of ATS, solved a set of difficult timing\nproblems in coordinating ArtBus timing requirements with the schedulers in the Adobe Flash program and the\nMax/MSP programming language. The result is an Open Sound Control and TCP protocol translator called the\nTransmogrifier (fig. 6).\nFigure 6 Screen\nShot of the\nTransmogrifier.\n\n11 Art with ArtBus\nAn example application of the ArtBus is Bo Rodda’s\ninstallation Active Light Cloud presented as part of\n2000 Watt Living, exhibited at the Salone Internazionale\ndel Mobile in Milan, Italy in April, 2009 (Rodda 2009).\nThere are other project examples on the ArtBus website.\n\nSummary and Conclusion\nAbout interface devices for art and design, it was said\nnot long ago that “we don’t need another board.” At\nsome time in the past it might also have been said\nthat we don’t need another automotive bus or another\nSCADA protocol. Clearly there will be more of both in\nthe future.\nIn art, design, and allied fields, technologies centered\naround sensible phenomena, information, and\ndynamic objects will be changed significantly by\nthe arrival of cheap 32-bit MCU’s. The line dividing\napplications using a host computer versus a stand-alone microcontroller for the main system intelligence will shift\ntoward the microcontroller. Nevertheless, as small controllers begin to overlap the computational capabilities of, for\ninstance, an iPod®, and the programming tools for 32-bit MCU’s are wrapped to give an Arduino-like feel to their use,\nthere will still be the need for the right amount of the right kind of i/o in the right place.\nFigure 7 Active Light\nCloud (Be Rodda)\n\nThe ArtBus hardware and software are in active development. New boards and refinements of the protocol are in\nprogress, and new options for manufacturing are being considered.\nWhat has been articulated in this discussion of the ArtBus is an argument for minimalism and simplicity. Our students\neasily accept the system, and most of them “get it” immediately. Reflecting on these characteristics, one should\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n103\n\nArtBus: A Minimal Bus and Protocol for Distributed\nInterfacing in Art and Design\nremember that ArtBus is designed for ease of programming and new hardware development by artists and designers\nwho are not technology specialists. There are at least eighteen automotive buses. ArtBus is an interface specifically for\nart and design, and there will likely be others to follow.\n\nCredits and Acknowledgments\nArtBus is an open source community project under development in the department of Art and Technology\nStudies, and the department of Architecture, Interior Architecture and Designed Objects at the School of the Art\nInstitute of Chicago.

Hoberman Associates’\ninstallation at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University, Adaptive Fritting, is used as a case study for the\nmore general thesis of mechanism design in architecture. Traditionally seen as expensive and impractical, ‘movement’ in\nbuildings can be accessible if done with high economy and simple elegance. The goal of this example is to illustrate the\ndesign process, challenges, constraints and parameters required to realize an adaptable architectural system.\n\n1 Premise for Adaptivity\nThe notion of a building that can move or reconfigure itself is not a novel concept. The premise of modularity and dynamic\ncontrol in combination with unique mechanisms has permeated architectural practice at many points and through a\ndiverse range of projects. Often, the large scale and custom nature of these systems with consideration given to structure,\nmechanism and control results in a cost that can only be justified by a projects high profile (Milwaukee Art Museum,\nSantiago Calatrava) or commercial benefit (Cardinals stadium roof and field example, by Peter Eisenman and HOK Sport).\nThe built environment is inevitably adaptive. Environmental forces beyond gravity and pressure are constantly causing\nbuilding materials to deflect, expand, contract, rupture, and deform all around us. Standard design guides us to\nlimit movement in favor of stability. However, if stability can be maintained while incorporating movement new design\nopportunities are suddenly possible.\nNew material systems in architecture have always produced new design opportunities. For example, reinforced concrete\nwas born through combining a metal lattice with liquid concrete. This new material system supported many of the amazing\nstructures we see today. Adaptive Fritting is a first embodiment of a newfound “material system” that allows the designer\nmicro-control of the user experience.\n\n2 Development of Adaptive Fritting Prototype\nInherent to the development of Adaptive Fritting was the desire to take an established architectural treatment and imbue\nit with expanded functionality. The benefit of such development would be twofold: providing architects with a new\ndesign element that is already a familiar part of their vocabulary and a performance increase that expands upon the\ncurrent appeal of using fritted glass (namely, as a means of easily customizing shading while preserving transparency\nwhere desired).\n\n2.1 Initial Assumptions and Behavioral Intent\nThe benefits of a fritted surface in reducing incident sunlight come from a combination of the surface treatment and\nthe density of that treatment. In setting out to achieve a purely mechanical transformation, focus was limited to the\nmodulation of density for initial investigations.\nIn order to preserve the current aesthetic of fritting it was important to create an object that was relatively thin. The\nprimary challenge then was in determining what type of motion could be applied to a standard fritted pane in order to\nachieve the desired density modulation without drifting too far a field of current fritting implementations. Once a desired\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n105\n\nAdaptive Fritting as Case Exploration for Adaptivity\nin Architecture\nmotion was chosen, material and construction choices could be made to complement that motion in development of\na proof-of-concept prototype.\nFurther, the desire to create an adaptive element requires a means of autonomous control. The assumption here was\nthat an electromagnetic motor would be used as an actuator in conjunction with programmable motor controller.\n\n2.2 Translational Motion by Parallelogram Linkage\nMechanical modulation of density requires the movement of material. Often, as with typical louvered systems, this is\nachieved by rotation of an element out of plane. Though the movement is economical, it establishes a direct relationship\nbetween density and depth. To achieve full coverage, the width of a louver dictates both the minimal spacing between\nlouvers in-plane and the minimal required depth through which the louver rotates.\nBy approaching modulation of density through an in-plane motion, the movement of material would require no change\nin depth but instead a change in height and/or width. This method of motion was deemed as preferable for a fritted\napplication as the relationship between the frit size and the sheet size would allow for small translations of a large\nsheet. The desired underlying motion to evolve from this thinking was a series of stacked sheets containing identical\nfrit patterns. When aligned, the stack would reveal a single frit pattern with multiple layers of depth representing a state\nof least density. When shifted in plane relative to one another, the sheet stack would create patterns of various density\ncorrelated to the distance of the shift.\nTo achieve this translational shift it was desired to utilize a parallelogram linkage system. The motivation for this decision\nwas driven by the mechanisms ability to simply convert a rotational motion into a translational motion. To further minimize\nthe addition of components, a scheme was devised by which the translational panels themselves could be used as\nthe linkages.\nFigure 1 Adjustment\nof Fritting Density by\nIn-Plane Translation\nof Stacked Panels.\n\n2.3 Actuation & Control\nBy utilizing a parallelogram linkage the\nresultant motion is not a pure linear\ntranslation, but a significant advantage\nis gained in economy of actuation. The\nrotational motion allows for the configuration\nof the linkages in symmetric locations\naround the axis of rotation. Since the\nlinkages are also the panels themselves,\nthe weight of the panels is fully supported\nat these pivot locations. The symmetrical\nweight distribution sets up a forcebalanced mechanism that establishes two\nadvantages. The first advantage is that\nextremely low torque is required to move the\npanels. The major considerations for motion\nthen become friction and inertia, allowing\nthe actuator sizing for control of the panels\nto be minimal yet scaleable for enhanced\nperformance. The second advantage is that\npanel position need not be maintained by the actuator. As such, power would only be expended while the panel density\nis modulated and could be minimized whenever the panel is at rest, regardless of position.\n\nFigure 2 Preliminary\nPatent Diagrams\nIllustrating Panel\nLinkage Actuation\nScheme.\n\nAs an adaptive element, responsiveness is a key factor in enabling a reaction to some impulse. The proposed\nmechanism handles this aspect well as only a small amount of rotation is required to achieve the maximum density\nshift. Thus, dependent upon gearing requirements and desired speed, very few actuator rotations will enable the full\nrange of motion, and speed is limited only by actuator size in relation to the inertial requirements of the load.\n\n106\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nAdaptive Fritting as Case Exploration for Adaptivity\nin Architecture\nFigure 3 Panel Stack-Up\nand Rotational Pivot\nMechanism.\n\n2.4 Material Considerations\nThe fundamental material requirement to be considered was panel material choice. Traditional fritting is typically created\nas part of the glazing manufacturing process. Fritting can also be applied as a secondary application, and various\nvinyl transfer technologies exist that emulate the “frosted” look of traditional fritting. For our purposes, utilizing glass\nwas impractical due to weight, fragility and manufacturing complexity. Additionally, our primary area of exploration was\nconcerned with density and not the properties of the frit itself.\nThe prototype was ultimately manufactured as laser cut cast acrylic panels. Clear acrylic was chosen to maximize\ntransparency and achieve the effect of glazing. To emulate a frit, an orthogonal array of circles was etched onto the\npanels so as to penetrate the protective laminate but not cut through the acrylic. When the protective laminate was\nremoved, an array of laminate dots remained affixed to the panels, serving as the fritting pattern.\n\n3 Prototype Findings\nThe prototype was manufactured first as a representative mechanical test unit, and then as a small run of seven panels,\nsix of which were installed as part of the exhibition Ecological Urbanism in Gund Hall at Harvard’s Graduate School of\nDesign. Functional expectations for the prototype were all met, and it served to validate the concept as constructed.\nThe issue of note uncovered in constructing the mechanical test unit was the necessity to maintain adequate\nspacing between the translating layers to prevent rubbing and abrasion of the surfaces. To achieve this\nseparation, polyester pads were introduced at regular intervals between the layers, concentric with the frit pattern.\nThough successful at maintaining an air gap between the moving sheets, the pads rubbing on the plastic induce a static\ncharge which is highly attractive to dust. Care was taken to keep the panels as clean as possible because cleaning\nrequires disassembly, but this emphasized the need to reconsider construction from a maintenance standpoint.\nPanel performance and responsiveness was verified at a level greater than anticipated for this construction. The short\nmotor stroke allowed for quick movement, thus validating the ability of the system to respond to events in real time.\nExtracting large variability through relatively small movement was one of the primary successes of this case study.\n\n4 Areas for Further Development\nThe development of the fritting stood up as a proof of concept as both a functional architectural element and an\naesthetically interesting mechanical phenomenon. Interest has already been expressed across multiple industries for\ndeveloping the core mechanism further. As this development relates to bringing the object into the built environment,\nthe following key areas would need to be addressed.\n\n4.1 Materials and Properties\nAs built, the Adaptive Fritting prototype requires more advanced thinking from a material standpoint. Acrylic served well\nas a convenient means of realizing the vision, but would only be applicable as for specific applications.\nThe critical area for improvement would be in re-conceiving the moving panel linkage system. Ideally the principles would\nremain the same, but a more minimal construction of the panels utilizing less material would be beneficial. Moving the\nmechanism away from stiff sheets and toward membrane-based construction seems the most likely development path.\nThe fixed panel encasement layers would also need to be reconsidered to allow for usage as a proper glazing panel.\nWeather tightness, insulative properties, acoustic properties, and maintenance would all need to be thoroughly\nconsidered depending upon the application. In order to effectively reduce solar gain, fritting is typically placed on the\nouter-most surface. The multi-layer approach of Adaptive Fritting will require the outer-most layers have the maximum\namount of fritting.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n107\n\nAdaptive Fritting as Case Exploration for Adaptivity\nin Architecture\n\n4.2 Actuation\nThe current implementation of motor control was based on available componentry and greatly exceeds requirements.\nDepending on changes to the mechanism and construction methods, actuation loads would be reassessed. Steps\ntaken toward tighter integration of an actuator within the panel would be necessary. Likely areas of near-term investigation\nwould be in flat-motor technologies and embedded control strategies.\n\nFigure 4 Installation\nat Harvard University\nfor the Ecological\nUrbanism exhibition.\n\n4.3 Patterning\nEfforts to date have looked at patterning only in relation to the number of stacked layers and spacing of an orthogonal\ngrid of similar elements. There is a great potential for patterning exploration to enhance the design potential of Adaptive\nFritting. Efforts will continue along these lines independent of more physical considerations.\n\n5 Application of Adaptive Fritting\n“Smart windows could reduce peak electric loads by 20–30% in many commercial buildings and increase day lighting\nbenefits throughout the U.S., as well as improve comfort and potentially enhance productivity in our homes and offices.”\n– Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\nSolar control in building envelope design is full of conflicting requirements. For example, maximizing view often increases\nsolar gain. While all-glass facades give occupants a connection to the outside environment, even high performance\nglazing cannot insulate as well as solid mass construction. Furthermore, un-shaded glass allows profuse amounts of\ndirect daylight into a space, creating areas of high contrast between light and dark. This high contrast effect, called\nglare, often forces occupants to close the blinds completely. Counter-productively, the darkness requires additional\nlighting which consumes electricity and generates heat.\nAn effective shading system allows view, blocks solar radiation, and scatters diffuse daylight deep into the space.\nMore specifically, a shading system’s effectiveness is based on the percentage of opaque material, thickness, opacity,\nreflectance, and position within the façade. Adjustable blinds and exterior louvers can be effective at reducing solar\nexposure of glazing but add complexity and expense through additional hardware installation. Spectrally selective\nsolar coatings are the most cost effective methods of blocking solar radiation. The best coatings available today can\nallow more than twice as much visible light as solar heat gain through a window pane. However, as better performing\ncoatings selectively block more of the visible spectrum, the color distribution does not always remain neutral. Therefore,\nmany designers have chosen fritting as an additional shading component allowing a lesser performing solar coating\nand a more neutral color glass.\nAnother reason the solar coating is effective is because the shading technology is concentrated in a very thin layer\nwithin the façade. This consolidation of hardware and complexity makes Adaptive Fritting simpler to install than\nexternal blinds and louvers. Architecturally, the façade can become thinner and higher performing. There are many\n“between the panes” technologies currently on the market that focus on consolidating complexity. Okasolar louvers\nare embedded within a double glazed cavity that reflect solar rays and also redirect sun light into the space through\nrotational adjustments. Holographic optical elements utilize the principle of diffraction to redirect sunlight. Electrochromic\ncoatings have great promise; however, they are still very expensive and do not diffuse light and do not maintain a bright\nview. Because the Adaptive Fritting technology is limited within the glazing unit, simple motion has a large performance\nand experiential impact.\nFigure 5 illustrates a contemporary façade design using variable static fritting to customize view and solar protection.\nGenerally, the greatest transparency for view is located on a wall between three and seven feet high. Façade areas\nbelow three feet and above seven feet are often opaque spandrel panels that primarily insulate and block solar gain.\nAdaptive Fritting provides opportunities for questioning these general rules of thumb. When no one is physically looking\nout the window, is view still important? Adaptive Fritting can control “on-demand” view by increasing transparency either\nwhen occupants approach the window or set the window to “viewing mode”. When viewing is not required, Adaptive\n\n108\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nAdaptive Fritting as Case Exploration for Adaptivity\nin Architecture\nFigure 5 AC Building,\nNew York–Frank Gehry.\n\nFritting will block solar gain while letting in diffuse light. Automated versus user-based controls are vital considerations in\ndesigning active systems. The design must be robust enough to allow both modes.\nThe building envelope designer is actually designing porosity and energy flow through a series of material surfaces. As\nan abstraction, Adaptive Fritting is concerned with modulating the parameters of pattern, porosity, and movement at\na micro scale. In contrast, special solar and electrochromic coatings are applied to glass homogenously. Thus, their\neffectiveness is not optimized as to where the sun is located in the sky. Adaptive Fritting’s multi-layer solution could\npotentially block solar radiation based on hemispherical angles of incidence tracking the sun’s movements above while\nallowing view for the occupants.\n\nConclusion\nThis paper described the process of mechanism design in architecture. Because complexity increases exponentially\nwith moving parts, finding economies is vital to an effective design. The maximum benefit must be extracted from every\ninch of motion. This case study, Adaptive Fritting, is purely an example and infinite variants can be explored through\naltering any parameter—motion, usage, material, or configuration. What if adaptive fritting utilized rotational motion\ninstead of translational motion? What if the acrylic sheet was punctured with holes instead of fritted with dots? This\nmodulated porosity could control air flow instead of sunlight.\nAdaptive techniques in building design will ultimately be adopted in a multitude of ways. From a behavioral standpoint,\ndesigners will be able to create more dynamic buildings that they can tune and will integrate this thinking early on in the\ndesign process. At the building management level, adaptive components will be able to interface with current Building\nManagement Systems and become an active part of a central control system to achieve regulatory benefits. Ultimately,\nadaptive architectural design will free people from having to make choices based on a buildings location and will allow\na building to tune itself to work within its surroundings.\n\nReference\nLee, E. and S.

This approach necessitates a dramatic shift in the architectural design, from producing\nstatic to environmentally responsive objects. It requires a shift in thinking from buildings as static and non-active systems\nto material system existing over time within specific environments capable of complex environmental performances.\n\n110\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nAdaptive Pneus\n1 Introduction\nCurrent and conventional buildings are mainly static and inanimate forms that vary slightly in shape according to\nextrinsic stresses. Their intrinsic nature builds up an interior condition that is incapable of adapting to the environmental\nchanges throughout the day. The Inability of static and unresponsive conventional buildings, introduces the use of\nenvironmental services such as mechanical cooling and heating devices. These devices are deployed in order to\novercome the inadequacy of various building forms. The application of responsive systems capable of reacting to the\nexternal environmental conditions provides a great opportunity for interior modulation via passive cooling and heating\nmeans (Wigginto 1988).\nCurrently ‘smart’ and ‘responsive’ systems are at the forefront of scientific and engineering research. Despite their\nprogress in the past few decades, these systems are still working as additional shading and ventilation devices. In the\nmajority of cases, these system and devices rely on energy-hungry mechanisms to operate, further straining depleting\nresources (Jeremidis 2004).\nThe word intelligent was first used to describe buildings at the beginning of 1980s and has been developing as a concept\never since. Recently the use of Smart materials has begun to introduce ideas of self adjustment and responsiveness\ninto design principles. The conventional paradigm of intelligent buildings is closely related to management systems and\ntheir methods of controlling complex interior conditions. Such systems posses active controls, allowing the motorized\naction of what may be called subordinate devices and appliances to be synchronized for environmental performance.\n(Wigginto 1988).\nThe research presented here is somewhat different to the traditional uses of intelligence and responsiveness. Here\nadaptability relates to the responsive action that affects the performance of the whole building and, therefore, holds a\nmuch closer relationship to the biological and natural ideas of responsiveness.\nThis is exemplified by various biological systems such as the thermoregulatory system of the human body, such\nmechanism can also be seen within other natural examples. Sensing and activating are nature’s predominant methods\nof responding to its conditions.\nWithin our system, the adaptation takes place in each component. This is done by utilizing local resources; such as\nmaking use of the impact of direct sunlight on the system. Detection and reaction are embedded in each cell and\nresponses take place locally and independently. These responses are further developed at the regional and global\nscales, allowing for distributed intelligence to occur across the whole system.\nThis allows for potential modulation of light, heat, sound, and ventilation via the simple geometrical manipulation of\ncomponents both locally and globally without the use of energy-hungry electromechanical devices.\nThis research commences by questioning and challenging the conventional methods of building design that would\nrequire further energy-consuming mechanisms to create suitable interior conditions. It therefore explores a new\napproach which integrates form generation, material behavior and capacity, manufacturing and assembly, to deliver\na modulated environment suitable for occupation. Such environments would no longer rely on secondary and tertiary\nmechanisms for further modulation.\nWe can focus the research and its reliance on natural systems as examples of systems which are already capable of\nresponding to their immediate environment, through a number of simple questions.\n1-How can a living organism actively adapt to its environment while having a robust and effective structure?\n2-How can they respond to continuous changes within their environment without collapsing?\n3-Can a building actively respond to external environmental stimuli while still effectively performing\nstructurally, without using energy-consuming electromechanical devices?\nIn contrast to traditional engineering and design methods, in biology, adaptation to the environment and structural\nperformance of a system are not opposing terms. They are embedded characteristics of natural systems and contribute\nfor the formation and evolution of organisms with regards to their innate material properties. This requires revisions of the\ntraditionally dominant notions of the structural design, which are stiffness and efficiency. “Stiffness in engineering terms\nimplies that structural members are optimized so that they do not easily bend and efficiency characterizes the preferred\nmode of achieving structural stiffness with the minimum amount of material and energy.” These definitions are in direct\ncontrast to the aspects discussed above which can be learned from natural systems. Natural organisms are driven by\nmultiple criteria for form generation and structural behavior, and performance is inherent.\nInstead, the notion of effectiveness will be introduced for finding the best possible answer according to the multiple\ncriteria (Weinstock et al. 2002).\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n111\n\nAdaptive Pneus\nA comprehensive understanding of inherent potential and limitation of material properties is critical when integrating\nperformance derived from natural systems into form-finding methods.\nIn nature, materials can display varied characteristics without change to their chemical makeup. The difference then\nemanates from its arrangement. Nature demonstrates masterfully how one and the same material can behave differently\ndue to changing conditions and requirements. The performance of natural systems is based on such structural\ndifferentiation, enabling them to react to their immediate environment, as well as bearing structural loads and not collapsing\nunder unanticipated phenomenon. The question remaining is how can the immense potentials existing in natural systems\nbe instrumentalized for architecture to deliver environmentally responsive buildings? (Weinstock et al. 2004)\nPneumatic material systems are abundant in nature for both structural and adaptation purposes. In the building industry,\npneumatic structures are among the lightest and most economically known. They present one of the lightest and\nrelatively cheapest means for spatial organization and environmental modulation. Their properties in regards to bearing\ntension and compression loads at the same time make them one of most interesting material systems.\nThe experiments started with interest in exploration of pneumatic material systems. It focuses on unfolding the\nperformative capacities inherent in the pneumatic material system with regards to the specific environmental condition.\nEcological adaptation is the principle of this design process. A different approach from the traditional architectural\nand engineering design process has been taken in order to understand the relationship between the material system\nand the environment. Stimulation of adaptation to modulate environmental and structural performance by the devised\npneumatic material system has been the main focus of the design process. This has been examined in an empirical\ndesign method which analyzes the construction of the material with regards to its geometrical features, assembly logic,\nconstruction limits and interaction with environmental conditions through natural stimuli.\nBoth physical and generative computational experiments and analyses contribute in the form-finding method used for\nthis project.(Hensel and Menges 2008).\nA new form-finding method that combines digital and material processes will be the main method by which the\nexperiments will be undertaken. It requires the recognition of buildings not as singular and fixed bodies, but as complex\nenergy and material system that have a life span, and exist as part of the environment. In this method, exploration of\nelements and components followed by proliferation are informed from material behavior, assembly logic and component\ngeometrical features, as well as its performative behavior under specific climatic conditions. The final design scheme\nforms up with regards to its performance and effectiveness under a particular environmental situation. Performance\nwill be measured via a determinant multi-criteria that interrelates the material system’s assembly and manufacturing\nlogic, spatial and environmental factors. This is different from traditional form-finding methods which mainly focuses\non mono-parametric structural behavior. A crucial aspect in multiple-parameter experiments is the redefinition of the\nnotion of efficiency. For instance, if only one structural parameter needs to be considered, like Gaudi’s hanging models,\nthe performance of the model can be optimized to a specific force-case. In multi-parameter set-up, each result is\na negotiation towards a best possible overall performance, with a great deal of redundancy built into the material\narrangements, so that shifts from one force scenario to another can be accommodated.\n\n2 Project’s Description\n\nFigure 2 Perspective\nview. Potential use of\nAdaptive pnue as the\nclimatic skin.\n\nIn order to find inherent characteristics and assembly\nlogic of pneumatic material system, initial experiments\nhave been undertaken. These experiments were\ndone using both physical and digital method to\nunderstand and instrumentalize the potentials of\npneumatic material systems.\nTwo main types of components were derived from\ninitial experiments and studies. Porous structural and\nopening components (figure 2).\nHaving combined the two, the final semi static/semi\ndynamic component was found. Then the structural\nperformance of the achieved model was empirically\ntested by building a 1/1 prototype roughly measuring\n3 * 3m (fig. 4).\nInspired by muscle movement in nature, a similar\ncontraction and expansion mechanism was developed.\nDirect sunlight radiation increases the turgor pressure\nexerted on the interior membrane of the components.\nOnce the pressure change is detected by pressure-\n\n112\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nAdaptive Pneus\n\nFigure 3 Structural\nstudies of Pneumatic\nComponent.

Installed in AA\nEmtech Studio garden.\n\nsensitive valves in the air-management units, compressors provide the air through pressure-release valves. This allows air\nto travel to the pneumatic muscles and the component opens.\nThis reaction does not take place during winter months due to the decreased turgor pressure within the pneumatic cells,\nallowing the system to be potentially deployable all year long, responding with seasonal changes and temperatures.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n113\n\nAdaptive Pneus\nThis part of our studies was completed by the development of a 1/1 prototype of the component, measuring 1.2 *\n1.2 m (fig. 5).\nFigure 5 1/1 prototype\nof the final component,\n1.2 m * 1.2 m\n\n2.1 Performance analysis\nParametrical relationships between the components define the behavior of the system in the given environment.\nScrutinizing the behavior of the material system in the specific environment helps to understand the relationship\nbetween physical characteristics of the system and the surrounding environment. This leads to the parametrical\ndifferentiation of the components in the local scale that reinforce the functionality of the system in the regional and\nglobal scale. These sets of experiments mainly investigate the behavior of the system in local scale to work out the\ndifferentiation rules of the components in the given environment. They comprise of CFD analyses and shadowcasting experiments.\n\n2.2 Shading experiment\nShading plays a significant role in passive cooling. In the devised material system, light penetration is actively controlled\nvia injection of smoke into the structure when necessary. This allows for the material system to adapt the level of\ntransparency based on the intensity of sunlight.\nHowever, if the components are fully translucent, they are still porous when direct sunlight hits them. This causes\nundesired direct sunlight to penetrate the interior space.\nThrough a series of digital experiments, the behavior of the components were understood, and via some geometrical\nmanipulations of the height and radii, variations in components and their behaviors were found in their ideal situation (fig. 6).\n\nFigure 6 Shadows\nin created form\nthe components\nin different vertical\nangles towards the\nsun, after geometrical\nmanipulation\n\n114\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nAdaptive Pneus\n2.3 CFD Analysis\nCFD analysis allowed us to study the relationship between different sized components and their behavior under\nprevailing wind, based on specific site conditions. Geometrical manipulations include height, opening angle and\ncomponent angle variations.\nThe results of the experiments indicate rules for component differentiation on the global scale. The components are\noriented towards the prevailing wind, when located at the windward side the angle of openings should decrease,\nwhile increasing when located on the leeward. This rule increases performance of the components for natural cross\nventilation. In addition, if the components stand with less than 45° against the wind, 4 opening elements on four sides\ncontribute to natural ventilation. However, once they stand with an angle greater than 45°, the leeward side openings\ngradually interrupt with the functionality of the components; therefore, they will be closed (fig. 7).\n\nFigure 7 CFD Analysis\nof the component\nin different angle\nvariation and opening\nangle to examine\nthe performance\nin different\ncircumstances.\n\n2.4 Design Proposal and Global Performance Assessment\nHaving finished the material system study and manufacturing, we employed the material system for an architectural\napplication to test performative and environmental modulation potentials of the system under specific environmental\nsituations. The project attempts to moderate the interior condition via controlling the light penetration and employing\nnatural ventilation as a means of passive cooling, therefore, decreasing demands for electromechanical devices. The\nroof cover also improves the residents’ living condition’s by creating roof garden space usable for inhabitants.\nBy taking macro- and micro-climatic features of the chosen site into consideration, the system was applied on a\ncollection of existing buildings as the second skin that creates a climatic envelope. Global surface morphology\nformed with regards to the structural and environmental performance of the material system and the project’s physical\nprogram. Further differentiation of the local scale in accordance with the parametric interconnection rules improved the\nfunctionality of the project.\n\n2.5 Multiple Criteria and Geometry Formation\nThe global morphology form is based on multiple criteria, which are in direct relation to the material system’s properties\nand capabilities. Multiple parameter experiments involving many forces acting together such as spatial, material,\nstructural, and habitation characteristics are approaches for the project.\nThe multiple criteria used in this project are comprised of\n1- Spatial quality and height limits\n2- Assembly and manufacturing constraints which have to respond to the complicated boundary condition and limits\nthe range of iso curves building the envelope\n3- Structural performance\n4- Environmental performance in which activation of cross-ventilation throughout the day, distribution of fresh air and\nlight filteration of the material system is analyzed\nFrom the criteria the first three factors are considered the dominant criteria which build up the first random geometry.\nThese three criteria have higher priority as the second skin surface (design proposal) is valid and feasible if and only if\nit meets the primary criteria.\nOnce the geometry satisfies the requirements of the initial criteria, its environmental performance has been analyzed to\nenhance its effectiveness. In so doing, location of opening in different times of the day should be indicated. Once the\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n115\n\nAdaptive Pneus\nlocation of the openings is understood, the designed surface\ncan be analyzed based on different openings throughout the\nday (fig. 8). The performance analysis provides the feedback\nfor the next iteration of form generation. Of course, the design\nloop starts again and the modified geometry should pass\nthrough initial criteria and then assessment process. this\nfeedback-form generation loop carries on until the desired\nform emerges.\nSolar analysis enables us to digitally simulate the location of\nthe openings for different times of the day throughout the year.\nLocation of openings should be measured with regards to the angle of each cell towards the sunlight. In this experiment\nwe aimed to anticipate the location of the opening throughout the day based on three sample times (10:00 AM, 12:00\nPM, 16:00 PM), (fig. 7). Indication of opening location throughout the day allowed us to analyze envelope ventilation\nperformance under a virtually created micro climate based on the chosen site.\nThe first set of experiments revealed that the initial morphology is suffering from lack of cross-ventilation in the morning\nand bad distribution of fresh air within the envelope.\nThe data driven from the first set of analyses was used for the modification of global geometry for the next iterations.\nGeometrical manipulation happened by utilizing a cellular automata algorithm. After some iterations of the global\nmorphology, the desired form emerged that benefited from active cross ventilation through the day and distribution of\nfresh air within the envelope (fig. 9).\n\nFigure 8\nLight Exposure\nAnalysis—In Global\nScale. in different time\nof the hottest day,\nand Numerical Value\ndriven from exposure\nof the surface towards\nthe sun at 12:00 PM.\nThis indicates the\nlocation of openings\nat that time\n\nParametrical differentiation of the components, obtained in the local performance analysis, allowed for better ventilation\nand shading performance.

In doing so, it takes a different approach to traditional engineering methods.\nTwo main types of experiments were devised that focused on structural and adaptable capacities of the material. These\nincluded physical and digital form-finding experiments that provide generative feedback loops for the purpose of various\n\n116\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nAdaptive Pneus\ngeometrical deformation studies in different circumstances. This enabled the project to develop through a bottom-up\nprocess. By combining the two experiments a final component emerged. Structural tests of the final components\nfollowed by development of opening mechanism completed the physical experiment processes. Studying various\ntypes of movement in nature such as variable stiffness, Reversible and Irreversible Movement Without Muscle and\nMovement with Muscle, helped to develop the movement mechanism for the components.\nEmploying a pneumatic muscle that is made of a flexible membrane attached to the main component, a reversible\nmovement abstracted from the natural mechanism of muscles, takes place. Pneumatic muscles are triggered\nfrom the amendment of existing turgor pressure exerted on the interior walls of the pneu membrane. The interior\npressure increase is driven from the exposure of the components towards the direct sunlight. Then, proliferation of the\ncomponents on various surfaces revealed the potentials and limitations of the material system for covering the spaces\nand environmental modulation.\nA detailed investigation of different manufacturing possibilities lead to the construction of a 1/1 prototype supplied by an\nappropriate manufacturer. The material system proved to be viable and an alternative solution of covering fully enclosed\ninterior spaces, capable of reacting to the immediate environmental conditions. This system is potentially capable of\nenvironmental modulation via natural ventilation and light-penetration control.\nThe final step of the research was the application of the developed system as a cover for a number of houses on the\nchosen site. The design proposal intended to potentially improve the interior condition of existing improperly constructed\nbuildings. The insertion of a second cover on the existing buildings made the adaptable pneumatic system a potential\nmodulator between the interior and exterior environment throughout the year. By creating a medium space on the roofs\nthat is a private usable space, design proposal strived to improve quality of life for the inhabitants.\nFrom the form generation under specific site and boundary conditions, the global morphology emerged and through\niterations, geometrical manipulation and performance assessment the functionality of the surface in terms of natural\nventilation was improved. Finally scrutinizing the behavior of the system in the local scale in various circumstances under\nthe climatic condition of the site, components were differentiated to enhance the functionality of the project in terms of\nnatural ventilation and shadow casting. Through the parametric manipulation of local elements, the functionality of the\nwhole system was improved.\nSome of the content in this paper is based on lectures given by Mike Weinstock, Michael Hensel, Achim Menges,\nGeorge Jeronimidis in Emergent Technologies and Design Master Program at The Architectural Association School\nof Architecture.\n\nRefErences\nHENSEL, M. 2008.

If well pursued, tiled objects can be easily designed and assembled.\nHowever, a geometric-centric view of tiling, whereby a predefined form determines the shape, size, and organization of\ntiles, has victimized the field of digital design. This paper questions the role of tiling as rationalizing method and offers an\nalternative theoretical framework and technical grounding for tiling behavior: the act of generation-through-tessellation\ninformed by material behavior. The tools developed are implemented in the design of a 3D-printed chaise lounge,\nusing multiple materials. The technical objective is to introduce a quantitative characterization and analysis of property\nmapping, as it is applied to a tiling algorithm using Voronoi cell tessellation. The network of tessellated Voronoi cells is\nused as an element in the Voronoi Finite Element Method (V-FEM) that the author developed. Various characterization\nfunctions and geometric parameters are generated, and V-FEM is executed for plane-strain analysis of doubly curved\nsurfaces, from which global and local responses are evaluated.\n\n1 Introduction\nPatterns in nature often inspire textures and patterns in architectural design. However, in the synthetic world, geometrical\nconsiderations traditionally define tiling choices, followed, after the fact, by behavioral constraints and material choices.\nThis paper proposes a material-based approach to tiling, whereby each tile,or group of tiles, represents different\nmechanical and, potentially, environmental properties as an integral part of the form-generation process.\n\n1.1 Material-based Design Computation\nCurrent CAD applications, including associative modeling software packages, appear frequently to promote generative\napproaches to design (Shea 2003). Rather than treating the computational media as merely representational, the designer\nis now able to establish parametric relationships between features, methods, and functions in a way that supports design\nprocesses of a generative nature. However, geometrical considerations, mainly, currently drive this liberation, which seems\nto be manifesting itself across the board throughout the continuous phases of the design process. Generative performative\nmodeling approaches have been introduced that engage principles of engineering with form finding. Yet, even when\nintegrating performance factors and tools that are significant in determining architectural form, material organization and\nbehavior are already predetermined design constraints and predefined factors. Form finding, in the digital realm, is thus\nrestricted to the relationship between structure and geometry (and/or fabrication); it does not generally incorporate, and\nsupport, the expression of material properties, organization, and behavior (Oxman 2008).\nDefined by the author as the process of computationally enabled form-finding, informed by material properties, Materialbased Design Computation promotes an integrated approach to design, whereby material properties inform the\ngeometrical generation of highly complex 3-D surface structures (Oxman 2007).\nThis approach allows the designer to incorporate the mechanical (along with other types of) properties in the process\nof form generation. Early work has demonstrated the theoretical and technical potential of this approach through design\nexperimentation and tool generation for stretchable fabrics and light-omitting surfaces (Oxman 2007).\n\n122\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nMaterial-Based Design Computation: Tiling Behavior\n1.2 Tessellation: Precedents\nTessellation—defined as the process of subdividing a surface into continuous, smaller elements that are geometrically congruent\nto their neighbors—appears to be a problem of great significance in Material-based Design Computation. This is due, namely, to\nits basic formulation as a geometric manipulation informed by formal constraints rather than behavioral data.\nThe work presented aims to establish the actions of surface tessellation as a process rudimentary to form generation by claiming\nthat tessellation algorithms could and should include physical data that is expressed geometrically. By considering parameters\nsuch as variable stiffness and tactility as functions informing the design of complex form, the work offers a theoretical and\ntechnical approach to tiling behavior.\nPrecedents pointing towards Material-based Tiling exist mostly as procedural protocols written for the analysis and optimization\nof form after it has been generated. Such computational research is generally found in the areas of optimization and visualization\n(DeHaemer and Zyda 1991) and focuses on issues of shape interpolation, namely, on the development of robust methods for\nconnecting new vertices over given surface representations, and on methods for smoothly interpolating between models that\nrepresent the same object at different levels of detail (Turk 1992). The key notion is that of a re-tiling procedure that involves the\ncreation of intermediate models, called the mutual tessellation of a surface, that contain both the vertices from the original model\nand the new points that are to become vertices in the re-tiled surface (Turk 1992).\nRelated work in computer science and visualization includes vector-field visualization and segmentation using centroidal Voronoi\ntessellation (Du and Wang 2004). In this method, the generators of the Voronoi regions in the tessellation are also the centers\nof mass with respect to a prescribed density. A distance function in spatial and vector spaces is developed to measure the\nsimilarity of spatially distributed vector fields. In this case, the tessellation assists in the analysis, simplification, and visualization of\nan existing material substance and its related vector fields. The method offers the generation of tessellated patterns a-priori or in\nparallel to form generation, such that geometrical properties inform physical attributes and vice versa.\nSpecialists in the field of computer science had previously reviewed a large body of literature on automatic mesh generation\nfor use in Finite Element techniques (Ho-Le 1988). In most of the cases examined, the aim was to subdivide the surface area\nor volume of a given object to provide a mesh, over which some physical properties of the material, such as heat dissipation,\nstresses, and strains, could be simulated. Here, once more, the application of physical properties is applied for the purpose of\nanalysis rather than the synthesis of form.\nThe field of computational geometry has also seen a good amount of work dedicated to tiling problems (Du and\nWang 2004). Specifically, the properties of Voronoi regions and the associated Delaunay triangulation are relevant to\nestablishing heterogeneous sizing hierarchies between triangular elements in the depiction of highly complex 3-D form\n(De Floriani et al., 1985).\nDigital design as a whole has experienced a renaissance in tiling through advancements in computational geometry and\nimplementation of associative modeling strategies in design (Kajima and Michalatos 2008). However, the question of how\nto extend the function of tiling beyond its role as a post-rationalizing strategy in the geometrical domain remains ill-developed.\n\n2 Tiling Behavior: Material-based Tessellation\nThe work presented here introduces the notion of tiling behavior as a theoretical framework, a methodological setup, and a\ntechnical approach that extends its role as rationalizing technique beyond geometrical representation. This work demonstrates\ntiling behavior through the development of computational tools that include material properties and their assignment to\ncorresponding structural and environmental performance data.\n\n2.1 Classes of Surface Tessellation\nThe breaking up of self-intersecting polygons into simple polygons is called tessellation, or more properly, polygon tessellation.\nThere are exactly three regular tessellations composed of regular polygons that symmetrically tile the plane. Tessellations of\nthe plane by two or more convex regular polygons, such that the same polygons in the same order surround each polygon\nvertex, are called semi-regular tessellations, or sometimes, Archimedean tessellations. In the plane, there are eight such\ntessellations. Simple and relatively known examples of surface tessellation are square and hexagonal tiling. Examples that are\nmore complex include Penrose tiling; randomly colored, uniform polygon tiles; or hexagons and pentagons that compose a\nBuckminster sphere. I distinguish between tiling of regular polygons (in 2D), polyhedrals (in 3D) and polytopes (for n dimensions).\nI propose four discrete approaches to surface tessellation, defined by the guiding content for the tessellation. Such\nclassification includes curvature-based tessellation, performance-based tessellation, assembly-based tessellation, and\nmaterial-based tessellation.\n\n2.2 Curvature-based Tessellation\nCurvature-based tessellations are tessellations informed by the geometrical features of the surface. Examples include the\ntransformation of polygonal-size variation as a function of the type and degree of curvature: smaller polygons are allocated in\nregions of sharp curvature, whereas larger cells are allocated in regions of low curvature.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n123\n\nMaterial-Based Design Computation: Tiling Behavior\n2.3 Performance-based Tessellation\nPerformance-based tessellations are tessellations informed by a set of governing performance criteria such as the type\nand magnitude of mechanical loads or heat flux. In this case, the variation of cell size and density is a function of force\nvectors that emulate the magnitude and direction of the structural load. Geometrical features on the hosting surface\ndemonstrate such functions. For instance, smaller polygons are allocated in regions of higher stress in order to increase\nthe surface area that connects the elements, and larger polygons are allocated in regions of lower stress.\n\n2.4 Assembly-based Tessellation\nFabrication constraints define assembly-based tessellation: in the case of repetitive fabrication, in which the size of each\npolygon edge is equal to all others, the polygonal tiling would be symmetrical across all directions. In other cases, the\nnumber of discrete measurements defined by the logic of assembly informs cell size and distribution.\n\n2.5 Material-based Tessellation\nMaterial-based tessellation assigns physical features to geometrical entities such as stress, strain, temperature flux, etc. In this case,\nmechanical material properties govern the relative form, size, and density of the cells. This class is different from all other classes\nas it relates to the substance of the surface as a heterogeneous curvature domain. The location of a finite set of heterogeneities,\ndefined by mechanical behavior, informs the tessellation. Each heterogeneity has a polygon, or a group of polygons, associated\nwith it. The mechanical properties ,as defined by the user, inform the spatial distribution of heterogeneities.\nNaturally, there could also be combinations of the classifications above, whereby a polygonal map, for instance, is defined by both\nthe surface’s curvature degree and its assembly logic.\n\n3 Methodology\nThe research demonstrates the notion of behavior tiling through the design, analysis, and fabrication of a chaise lounge, created\nby the incorporation of physical parameters into digital form-generation protocols.\nA single continuous surface acting both as structure and as skin is locally modulated to cater for structural support on\nthe one hand and sensual relief on the other. The chaise combines structural, environmental, and corporeal performance\nby adapting its thickness, pattern density, stiffness, flexibility, and translucency to load, curvature, and skin-pressured\nareas respectively. Multiple algorithms are generated that correspond to these variables, such that stability is mediated\nwith the sense of pleasure upon surface contact, and structural integrity, with visual and sensual experience. In this\nlight, the chaise celebrates the negotiation between engineering and experiential performance. It is a method as much\nas an object of pleasure that promotes material and structural integrity with the physical act of sitting and lying down\nagainst a hard-soft surface.\nFigure 1 Chaise design\ninformed by material\nproperties assigned\nto pressure map\nregistration, body form,\nand body weight\n\n4 Tiling Behavior: Implementation in the Design of a Chaise Lounge\n4.1 Introduction\nThe project presented here represents a case study for the design of a chaise lounge that demonstrates the notion of\ntiling behavior. The traditional chaise is transformed to promote lounging of a different kind. The cellular pattern applied\nto its entirety is designed to increase the ratio of surface area to volume in areas where the body potentially rests. A\npressure map study is conducted that matches the softness and hardness of the cells to cushion and support sensitive\nand high-pressured areas.\nBy analyzing anatomical structures that cause concentrated pressures, the chaise becomes softer and flexible where pressure\nneeds to be relieved (fig. 1). The relative volume of each cellular cushion is locally informed by pressure data averaged with\nvalues that represent structural support and flexibility. Global and local mean curvature values inform its density, such that\ndenser, smaller cells are organized in areas of steep curvature, whereas larger cells are found in areas of shallow curvature.\n\n124\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nMaterial-Based Design Computation: Tiling Behavior\nThe chaise’s natural relation of structural and sense datum is propagated in variable polymer composites, offering a\nwide range of physical properties. Through these algorithms, force conditions naturally propagate functionality. Stiffer\nmaterials are positioned in surface areas under compression, and softer, more flexible materials are placed in surface\nareas under tension. State-of-the-art technologies are applied here for the first time to cater for a large range of physical\nproperties and behaviors. The surface patches are printed in 3-D, using a new multi-jet matrix technology, which\nsimultaneously deposits materials of different properties, in correspondence to structural and skin-pressure mappings.\nFigure 2 Example of\nVoronoi construction\nwith a vertical\nprojection. The tile\nsqueezing correlates\nto the angle between\nthe surface normal and\nthe projection vector.\n\n4.2 Voronoi Tessellation: Introduction\nFigure 3 Point cloud\ndensity representation\nmapped from\ncurvature\n\nVoronoi tiling appears in disparate fields (Turk 1992). In\nthis method, each tile is defined by the set of points that\nlie closest to each generated point (i.e., a hexagonal tiling\nderives from a hexagonal lattice of generating points). Many\nalgorithms exist that produce simple versions of Voronoi\ntessellations from point clouds. Fast Voronoi algorithms have\nbeen developed with computational geometry techniques,\nbut the computations are generally time-consuming.\nA Voronoi tessellation is an example of a tiling generated\nby a random point process, in which the tiling develops\nalgorithmically from points that appear on a surface by\nsome random or informed process. In most cases, a homogeneous, uniform, random distribution (also called a\nPoisson process) generates the points. In such a uniform process, no position is favored over another: the Voronoi\ntiling segments the object at the length scale of the average distance between points. As a result, the tiling is\nhomogeneous when averaged over larger distances. However, the Voronoi tessellation need not derive from such\na uniform, random process.\nThe object in fig. 2 is an example: the individual texture components (i.e., the SPline loops) derive from a Voronoi\ntessellation, but the point cloud density is a function of the object’s local geometric curvature, demonstrating the\nconcept of curvature-based tessellation. In this case, because local stiffness and tactility depend on local tile size,\nthe object’s geometry is intrinsically coupled to its material behavior, and as we shall explain, the converse is also true.\n\n4.3 Voronoi Tessellation in Curved Surfaces\nBecause the Voronoi definition includes a distance function (i.e., “closeness” is a comparison of distances), the Voronoi\nconstruction depends on what is meant by distance. In the simple case of a Voronoi construction on a two-dimensional\nplane, the common choice is the Euclidean distance √ (d = x2 + y2, also called the L2-norm), but there are an infinite\nnumber of ways to define a distance. For the Euclidean distance, the Voronoi tiles are all polygons, for which each shared\npolygon edge is (a segment of) the perpendicular bisector of the ray that joins the generating point centers of the two tiles.\nThe set of all rays connecting neighboring Voronoi centers is a skeletal structure that is “dual” to the Voronoi construction,\nand is called a Delaunay triangulation. However, the resulting polygonal structure is particular to the definition of distance.\nOn curved surfaces, such as the uniformly curved sphere, the definition of distance is generally complicated as the\ntile edges have out-of-surface curvature. For non-uniformly curved objects, the distance definition, and the algorithms\nto find their corresponding tessellations are complex and typically undeveloped. In these cases, tile edges have nonuniform in-plane and out-of-plane curvatures.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n125\n\nMaterial-Based Design Computation: Tiling Behavior\nThere are methods to use a simplified distance metric to produce a Voronoi tessellation on\na curved surface. An example follows (fig. 3). A point cloud can be generated on the vertical\nprojection of a surface, or a point cloud on a curved surface can be projected vertically to\na plane. In the first case, a uniform cloud distribution on the plane produces a non-uniform\npoint cloud on the surface; in the second case, a uniform point cloud on the surface\nproduces a non-uniform cloud on the plane. In either case, the Euclidean algorithm can be\nused to produce a Voronoi tessellation on the projected plane, and that tessellation can be\nprojected back onto the surface. Such methods are possible on limited surface types (i.e.,\ngraphs of the form z = f(x, y)). The surface’s angle of inclination from the vertical produces\nthe non-uniformity of the point cloud: points become arbitrarily close in regions where the\nsurface approaches verticality.\nThe choice of algorithm may potentially have property-related consequences. Figure 4 illustrates\nthe effects of this algorithm. A full implementation of an L2-norm on a U and V coordinate\nsystem embedded in a surface of the form {x(u, v),y(u, v),z(u, v)} would be computationally\nprohibitive. An algorithm that approximates this norm produced the final object.\nIn figure 4, note the density increase at regions of large squeezing. The illustrated solution: a\nuniform point cloud on the 3-D surface is a non-uniform cloud on the UV plane. The Voronoi\nconstruction in the UV plane produces odd-looking cells on the UV-plane but uniform\nVoronoi on the 3-D surface.\n\nV-FEM: Weighted Material Selection\nDuring the initial stages of the design, the texture inherits the geometrical features of the\ndesign as defined by the user. Such geometrical features, in the case of the chaise, are\ncustomized to fit body curvature criteria. The initial distribution of cells corresponds to the type\nand degree of curvature: smaller, denser cells are located in regions of high curvature, and\nlarger, sparser cells are located in regions of low curvature. Material properties correspond\nto both structural requirements (self-stability with no additional enforcement members) and\nenvironmental requirements (assigned to the body pressure mappings). For the structural\nperformance, a stochastic computational process was developed, in which stiffer materials\nare assigned to vertical regions, which work for buckling, and softer materials are assigned\nto horizontal regions, which work for bending (fig. 5). The probability of a material being\nstiffer or smoother depends on the angle defining the level of horizontality in the chaise.\nRegarding the environmental requirements, the degree of pressure mapped onto the chaise defines the relative height\nof each cell, such that softer and bigger silicon bumps are located in regions of higher pressure (fig. 6).\n\nFigure 4 Example\npoint cloud\nproducing\nUV-squeezing\n\nFabrication\nThe chaise was fabricated using a multi-material\n3-D printing technology. Thirty-two sections were\nassembled, each comprised of five material\ncombinations ranging in stiffness from hard to soft.\n\nEvaluation\nFabricated as a scaled prototype, this project is\npotentially under way for mass manufacturing. In\nconsidering assembly in full scale, some rigorous\nevaluation processes must be accommodated for.\nIn the case of the current scaled build, the model\nwas fabricated from photopolymers, which mimic the\nproperties of polypropylene. It simulates toughness\n(Izod notched impact of 44.22 J/M), flexibility\n(elongation at break of 44.2 percent) and strength\n(elastic modulus of 1,135 MPa) of polypropylene.\nSuch materials appear to be incredibly robust for\nthe generation of small-scale models and some\nimplementations in product, and industrial design.\nFigure 5 Weighted\nHowever, since most of these technologies are developed for prototyping purposes, material fatigue may prohibit fullmaterial selection: a\nscale development.

However, such processes are predominantly linked to geometrical\nmanipulations in three dimensions. The work presented here, along with extracts from recent paper in Materialbased Design Computation, calls for a shift from a geometric-centric approach to form generation to material-based\nprocesses. Such a shift entails that we include the optimization processes much earlier in the design process: material\nproperties and behavior should be accounted for a priori to a commitment to form. Tiling has been the subject of many\ninnovative design projects in both academic and practical frameworks, as it tightly relates to issues of fabrication and\nassembly of components. This work represents an attempt to rethink the role of tiling not as a formal maneuver for the\nrationalization of form materialization but, rather, as a means to incorporate physical behavioral constraints early on. It\ndoes so by introducing a theoretical and technical approach, titled Tiling Behavior, which explores the integration of\ntessellation generation with a finite element method approach to mechanical optimization, titled V-FEM.\n\n5.2 Design Method: Voronoi Finite Element Tessellation\nThe Voronoi cells applied in this work were obtained by Dirichlet tessellation of complex 3-D surface representations.\nThis process involves the discretization of a heterogeneous curvature domain, based on the location of a finite set\nof behavioral heterogeneities that are defined by mechanical behavior. The paper demonstrated the application and\n\n128\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nMaterial-Based Design Computation: Tiling Behavior\ngeneration of tessellations based on fitness criteria and material properties. This approach, titled V-FEM, promotes an\nalternative to traditional optimization algorithms that are applied on top of an already existing model. In other words, the\nV-FEM methods promote an integral approach to generation through optimization, whereby a finite element-like method\nis inherently linked to behavioral data and geometrical organization.\n\n5.3 Design Technique: UV Recompression Algorithm\nThe UV re-compression algorithm implemented in this work demonstrated how to apply a Voronoi mapping on a\nhighly complex, doubly curved 3-D NURBS surface. The need for such an algorithm was introduced by the difficulties\npresented in using projections, and resulted in extreme UV-squeezing conditions where point cloud density increases\nat regions of large squeezing. The solution involved the transformation of a uniform Voronoi point cloud mapped on the\n3-D surface into a non-uniform point cloud on the UV plane. The resulting solution is that the uniform point cloud on the\n3D surface is a non-uniform cloud on the UV plane. The Voronoi construction in the UV plane produces odd-looking\ncells on the UV-plane but a uniform Voronoi pattern on the 3-D surface. Such a recompression algorithm may potentially\nbe generalized to include other types of tiling patterns, based on complex point cloud registrations.\n\n5.4 Design Evaluation: V-FEM as Case Study\nComplex models that correspond to a multitude of fitness functions require sophisticated tools for their evaluation. The\nwork presented in this paper focused on the generation and implementation of V-FEM as an approach to behavior\ntiling. However, the structural and environmental evaluation of this tool has yet to be developed. A shape-annealing\napproach to tile typology that considers the dynamic growth of tiles as a function of vector mapping appears to offer\none such promising direction.\n\nAcknowledgments\nTHE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE INTERNATIONAL BIENNIAL FOR CONTEMPORARY ART AND DESIGN AND THE BIACS\nFOUNDATION FOR EXHIBITING THE CHAISE LOUNGE THIS FALL IN SEVILLE.

The Tall Building Simulation (TBS) model is the result of a collaborative partnership between\nAedas, Arup, Hilson Moran (HM), and Davis Langdon (DL). This article details both the technical content behind the\nmodel and an analysis of the relationships demonstrated by the outcome.\nIt is estimated that most decisions determining the sustainability of a project are made in the first 1 percent of a\nproject’s program, whereas the majority of the information required for sustainability assessment is not usually available\nor examined until after the concept stage. By this time, most solutions would need design or briefing changes that are\ntoo costly to implement.\nThe model incorporates early stage spatial, mechanical (HM), and structural (Arup) analysis that are linked to cost and\nlife-cycle databases (DL) through a parametric interface designed by Aedas. Its interactive interface is structured to\noperate at different levels of detail to allow users with varying expertise to analyze and explore alternatives in real time.\nThe objective with TBS was to distil this expertise into a singular “intelligent” model that demonstrates the interaction of\neach discipline against the cumulative annual energy and maintenance costs of the building.\nUsing the TBS model, architects, engineers, and clients can simultaneously explore the impact of typical technical and\ndesign decisions on a tall building’s energy footprint and its dynamic relationship to cost at the briefing stage. The model\nalso emphasizes known but rarely quantified user impacts such as tenancy types, occupancy, and operating hours to\nreaffirm the need for buildings to be perceived as an interface through which occupants engage with their environment.\n\n1 Introduction\nAn astounding number of tall buildings have been constructed over the past decade. From Dubai to Cartagena, new\nneighborhoods and cities have been created that are primarily tall building-led, and barely a new urban development\nhappens without the token tower project. The debate about the true sustainability of such tall buildings has become\nmore animated over recent years as people have begun to question both the urban benefits of tall buildings conceived\nwithout adequate infrastructure and the claim of their efficiency.\nThis paper introduces a framework and tool designed to evaluate the impact of design and briefing decisions on the\nenergy footprint of tall buildings. In discussing the key assumptions behind the Tall Building Simulation model, this paper\nalso challenges current briefing and design practice for determining the energy footprint of tall buildings.\nWhilst this project looks specifically at the footprint of a singular building, further research is currently underway that\nstudies the impact of such projects’ load on local environmental, social, and transport infrastructures (Deal, 2004).\n\n130\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nSustainably Tall: Investment, Energy, Life Cycle\n2 Why Tall?\nBecause of the quantities and repetition involved in tall buildings, any efficiencies that can be gained during the design\nprocess results in savings of magnitude. The potential gains to be had from sustainable features are, therefore, far\ngreater than for any other building typology. Tall buildings are also highly constrained by structural and other efficiency\ndrivers, which lend this building type well to parametric exploration.\nThe capital investment and complexity of a tower already requires substantial upfront optimization and prototyping by\nthe disciplines involved. Sustainable design features rely on the integration of such specialist design and technical\nexpertise. The TBS model has made this possible at an extremely early stage.\nFigure 1 Examples of\nTower Design by Team\n\n3 Cost vs Value\nMembers of the project partner group have been involved in the design and construction of tall buildings, with many tall\nbuilding projects on-site and completed (fig. 1).\nThrough our collective experience with tall buildings and the implementation and verification of sustainable design\nfeatures, we have concluded that the way in which building performance is evaluated, particularly during briefing and\nconcept stage, needs to be addressed.\nFor the past 50 years, building energy use has been firmly in the realm of mechanical engineering. With staff costs\namounting to between 80 and 90 percent of a building’s annual operating costs, energy use has not featured as part\nof investment models or architectural expression (Collins 2008). As CO2 legislation gains momentum across the global\ncommunity, developers and clients alike are examining the financial incentives for investing capital in solutions that\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n131\n\nSustainably Tall: Investment, Energy, Life Cycle\nreduce the energy footprint of buildings. New research linking higher employee performance to indoor environmental\nquality and socially and environmentally responsible business practice is having a noticeable impact on client briefing\n(Kats 2003). Despite the recent drop in oil prices, studies of commercial rental rates have concluded that income from\nLEED-rated buildings is higher, and has been less exposed to recessionary trends than the rest of the office market\n(Say 2008; Morris 2007). A tougher regulatory environment and the change of focus in corporate social responsibility\ntowards mitigating climate change—along with fluctuations in energy costs—have demonstrated that energy is an\nincreasingly important factor in the design and commissioning of buildings. This reveals a need for studies that explore\nthe relationship between low carbon designs and their impact on capital and whole-life cost (Eichholtz et al. 2008).\nBeyond communicating energy use, a key challenge for the industry has been the lack of data from completed buildings\nto validate design assumptions and forecast calculations.\n\n4 The Value of Good Data\nRecognizing the significance of having supporting data to argue sustainable design solutions, the team has included\nreal energy use data collected through post-occupancy evaluations and embodied energy figures from recognized\nsources of data (Anderson and Shiers 2002; Hammond and Jones 2008; Fay et al. 2001). Published research on the\nenergy use of tall buildings were used as benchmark comparisons to verify the outcomes of the model (Collins et al.\n2008; Kalita and Watts 2007; CIBSE 2008; Bordass et al. 2000; De Jong and van Oss 2007).\nThe discrepancy between this data and the predicted energy use that the model serves to highlight is the omission\nof user impact from the calculations required for regulatory compliance (Approved Document L1A, 2006). Appliance\nloads, the effects of changes in occupancy, operating hours, and energy intensive functions in the building are not\nusually part of a building’s statutory energy use forecast. By excluding occupant behavior and building management\nfrom the realm of briefing and design, we overlook a major contributing factor to building energy use (Bordass 1998).\nThe interface, as an easily legible dashboard of this quantitative information, has been intrinsic to the model as a design\ntool to communicate the combined impact of early stage decisions by all parties. The energy bar in particular (fig. 2)\nFigure 2 Energy Bar\nand Color Code\n\nhas been adapted from CarbonBuzz (app. 1) to interpret concisely the energy data, as it represents the cumulative\noutcome of all disciplines.\n\n5 BIM vs. Intelligent Model – working across disciplines\nSuccessful implementation of low-energy design requires maximum overlap between disciplines during the design\nprocess, particularly at the early concept stage. With the development of Building Information Models (BIM), in which\nall disciplines share 3D information, there is more of an opportunity for cross-fertilization between specialists and their\nrespective silos of expertise. BIM provides the opportunity for extracting quantitative or performance data faster (areas,\nstructural, and environmental analysis), but by the time a model with an adequate level of detail to establish energy use\nis constructed, it is too late to address many significant drivers such as orientation and massing.\n\n132\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nSustainably Tall: Investment, Energy, Life Cycle\nFigure 3 BIM\n\nRecently, platforms such as Generative Components, Digital Project, Grasshopper, and direct script-based solutions\nhave helped designers develop workflows that capture “design logic,” (i.e., representations of the spatial and geometric\nhierarchy of buildings in a lightweight format [fig. 3]).\nAlternatively, an “intelligent” model captures a representation of the spatial and geometric hierarchy of a building and\nutilizes “rules of thumb” to evaluate the model based on underlying relationships, in place of finite element and thermal\nsimulations that are far too intensive for interactive software. In the TBS model, simplified analysis methods from\neach discipline illustrate in quantitative terms the tacit understanding of leading experts of the workings of sustainable\nsolutions, and predict environmental performance in an early stage, parametric 3D design model.\nFigure 4 Intelligent\nModels\n\n6 Methodology\nIn the course of this research, Aedas has led over twenty multidisciplinary workshops with structural engineers and\nsimulation specialists, services engineers, lift consultants, façade consultants, life-cycle assessors, experts in financial\nmodeling, MEP cost consultants, structural cost consultants, and façade cost consultants, as well as architects with\nmany years of experience in delivering tall commercial buildings. The input from these experts was captured and the\nrelationships between disciplines were mapped out in sketches, algorithms, and Excel tables. In creating the Tall\nBuilding Simulation model, we have built a spatial “rig”—a 3D parametric model—where the quantitative parameters of\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n133\n\nSustainably Tall: Investment, Energy, Life Cycle\ngeometric components are “tagged” and linked to the algorithms describing mechanical, structural, and cost behavior\nsimultaneously. This allows a live update of cost, life-cycle cost, energy use, and embodied energy through a graphic\ninput/output interface.\nTaking as a starting point early assessment tools currently in development, the team anticipated that such a model\nwould help highlight some less intuitive relationships behind form, structure, services, cost, and energy footprint, and\ncommunicate the most critical areas for a design team to address during the concept and briefing stages (Bordass\nand Gething 2006).\n\n7 Model Assumptions\nTo reduce the complexity of the task, the team constrained the initial model scenarios to the shell and core design of\ncommercial office towers and, using BCO standards as a guideline, simulated only the behavior of tall buildings with regard\nto their energy footprint (i.e., energy use and embodied energy), against building efficiency capital costs and life-cycle costs.\nThe tower footprint is based on an octagon to simplify not only the mechanical analysis through eight façade orientations\nbut also the structural strategy, by specifying a central core and axial symmetry. The maximum floor plate width and\ndepth has been set to 60 m to accommodate escape distances to a single core, as secondary lift cores would\nimmediately be subject to some notion of design, as the placement and orientation is not defined necessarily by\nregulation. (For mechanical and structural assumptions, see app. 1.)\n\n8 Model scenarios\nThe most common target at the briefing stage is net achievable area for a particular footprint. If a standard occupancy\n(14 m2 per person as per BCO guide standards for office areas) and an initial net-to-gross ratio are assumed, the\nnumber of occupants can be computed over the gross area of each floor plate. These, in turn, generate values for\ninternal gains, lifts, stair sizes, and plumbing requirements, which determine the plant and riser shaft sizes needed to\nserve the tower. With the internal requirements of the core set, a structural solution is computed, producing an actual\nnet-to-gross ratio. This figure is then re-used for the next calculation cycle and so on, until the minimum number of floors\nis achieved for the target net area.\nWhile the structure is dependent on the required area of the mechanical core—to determine core-wall and column\ndimensions—riser and plant size are likewise dependent on the space occupied by the structure that affects the net\narea. This, in turn, determines the volume of conditioned air, which will prompt the recalculation of plant and riser size.\nWith any modifications to the relevant parameters, this co-dependent relationship requires solving several iterations to\nfind an equalized result.\nInitially, a simple extrusion is generated, after which the model can be manually altered to match different designs and\na variety of mechanical, structural, and façade specifications.\nIn the scenarios below, we have described the typical impact of these specifications on a tall building’s CO2 footprint\nand capital and life-cycle costs. The scenarios also demonstrate how changing these will affect the building’s efficiency\nindicators (net to gross, wall to floor), energy use, and embodied and life-cycle costs.\n\n8.1 Occupancy\nIncreasing occupancy leads to increased equipment load, internal gains, cooling load, and MEP size, and a reduction\nin net to gross. The cost of energy increases significantly, adding to the life-cycle cost.\nAs occupancy increases, energy use grows at a greater rate, suggesting that while area is the standard measure,\nstating energy use per occupant may also be relevant. Not apparent in the model are the impact of such high densities\non productivity, the marketability of the suggested use, and the ultimate impact on the profitability of companies working\nin crowded conditions, all of which can be explored with further research.\n\n8.2 Wide versus slender towers\nA slender tower demonstrates less efficiency across the board due to a higher wall-to-floor ratio and a lower net\nto gross. With a larger percentage of structure and, consequently, less net area, the shallower floor plates lead to\nincreased embodied energy per m2, and reduced floor plate efficiency due to the requirements of the lifts, risers, and\nstairs, preventing the core from shrinking beyond a minimum limit.\nWider towers can be more cost effective by up to 10 percent, as broadening the footprint increases the gross area\nfaster than the façade area, which is the highest cost component by m2. This makes deeper floor plates more efficient,\nas there is proportionately less façade to install and maintain.\nOne benefit of a slender tower, however, is that daylight access improves as the distance from the façade to the\ncore decreases, resulting in a greater proportion of Grade A office area. This zone requires no artificial lighting for\napproximately 50 percent of the year in the UK, which can reduce energy consumption by up to 10 percent (fig. 5).\n\n134\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nSustainably Tall: Investment, Energy, Life Cycle\n\nFigure 5 Daylighting\nand Solar Gain\n\nAlthough a given shape, form, specification, and life span would suggest an optimum width versus daylight and energy\nuse, the impact of other parameters such as the mechanical system, floor-to-ceiling height, and shape of the building\nall have to be considered, as many of these systems are determined from the combined demands of several floors.\nWith such benefits achieved through natural lighting, there should be more emphasis on improving daylight penetration\nand control through design. A future stage of the model aims to take into account the impact of building features such\nas atria on day lighting and efficiency.\n\n8.3 Shape\nTo illustrate the implications of shape, an extruded tower is compared to two towers of identical net area with inclined\nand bowed elevations (fig. 6).\n\nFigure 6\nExtruded, Inclined and\nBowed Elevations\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n135\n\nSustainably Tall: Investment, Energy, Life Cycle\nThe rotational symmetry of the footprint constrains the center of mass about the axis of the tower. Allowing the core to\nbe off-center would require structural calculations that are more complex. (See app. 1: Model Assumptions.)\nSurprisingly, the inclined tower has the best wall-to-floor ratio, approximately 2 percent higher than the straight\ntower, but requires a broader footprint or additional stories to achieve the same net area. The deeper floor plates\nat the base offset any savings gained through better daylight access at the top where the tower is narrower.\nStructurally, it can be assumed that inclined towers require less material due to the effects of wind loading because\nof their geometry; however, this requires design beyond early concept stage calculations. If we discount the impact\nof higher heat gains on a tilted façade, form in itself appears to have less than expected bearing on overall energy\nuse and efficiency (fig. 7, 8, 9).\n\nFigure 7 Extruded\nTower Form output\n\nFigure 8\nInclined Tower\nForm output\n\n136\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nSustainably Tall: Investment, Energy, Life Cycle\nFigure 9 Bowing Tower\nForm output\n\n8.4 Floor-to-Floor Height\nFloor-to-floor height has an impact on daylight penetration and has mechanical repercussions, as it relates to the\nvolume of air per floor. Assuming a constant floor and ceiling build-up, greater floor-to-floor heights substantially\nincrease the volume of material needed to construct the tower (thereby increasing embodied energy). This raises\nthe wall-to-floor ratio and, therefore, capital cost by 5 to 10 percent. The increased air volume per floor results in\nmarginally higher fan loads, which the greater access to daylight offsets straightaway. In practice, the vast cost\nincrease is difficult to justify with improved spatial quality alone. However, beyond a certain floor-to-floor height,\nnatural ventilation/mixed mode becomes an option, even for tall buildings. The authors intend to consider natural\nventilation in the next version of this model, and study its impact on key performance criteria, from efficiency to lifecycle cost. With mechanical costs often being responsible for a large part of the operational carbon footprint, the\nresults of this study are expected to be significant.\n\n8.5 Orientation and Cladding\nThe orientation of a building plays a significant role in the cooling loads required to combat heavy solar gain. The trend\nfor tall buildings is to apply a blanket improvement in the G value, which can bring about a 3 to 5 percent reduction in\nyearly CO2 emissions, with a similar percentage hike in capital cost. A more subtle approach to façade treatments can\nresult in just a marginal increase in capital cost.\nBased on studies conducted with our model, a tower with identical façade treatments on all sides, rotated 90 degrees,\nproduces a constant emissions profile, as internal gains from increased solar radiation on the south are balanced by a\ndecrease in radiation from the north. By selecting good solar control for the south façade, increasing the solid areas on\nelevations facing east and west, and reducing the solar performance of cladding on the north elevation, one can save\non capital cost without affecting energy use.\nThe simulation demonstrates that variation may be employed for function as well as design, and may additionally lower\nthe capital investment when compared to a uniform cladding system.\nThe complexity of a design (considered as a percent increase in façade length per orientation) affects the exposed\nsurface area of the tower, which contributes to heat gain. Beyond a certain façade performance, however, this is\nconsidered marginal in the UK climate, suggesting that although added complexity increases façade cost, this feature\nhas a minimal impact on the building’s performance.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n137\n\nSustainably Tall: Investment, Energy, Life Cycle\n8.6 Mechanical Systems\nWhile there are many influences that support the selection of a specific mechanical system over another, the options\ngiven in the model attempt to demonstrate the breadth commonly available in the industry. Each system below has\nindividual implications on capital cost, life cycle, and space requirements, in addition to variations in their respective\nenergy profiles. These will have downstream effects on net to gross, life-cycle cost, tenant subdivision, and emissions\n(see app. 2 for further details). The systems are as follows:\nFan-assisted VAV, displacement ventilation, and fan-coil systems\nWater- or air-cooled chillers\nWith or without heat recovery\nFor an air-conditioned, sealed tower, specification presents one of the greatest sources of efficiency. With MEP costs\naccounting for up to one-fifth of a tower’s capital cost, as seen from the above studies, the impact of better system\nspecifications over lifetime energy and maintenance costs presents a powerful argument for marginal increases in the\ncapital cost of MEP systems.\n\n8.7 Daylight Controls\nDaylight control systems rely on photosensors that typically operate within a zone 4.5 m from the façade (with greater\nfloor-to-floor heights, the depth of daylight penetration increases), and which automatically turn off perimeter lights at\nsufficient lux levels. Within the model, a climate data sheet stores average hourly daylight values that relate to the annual\nnatural illumination available. Aside from sky illuminance, time of day, sky conditions, and overshadowing, the required\ninternal lux levels are dependent upon facade length, the floor-to-ceiling height, and the façade specification.\nThe model demonstrates that daylight controls can reduce energy cost in the range of 5 to 10 percent even in London,\nsuggesting that savings could be even greater in cities with brighter skies. This estimate includes a reduction in any\nheat gains from the lighting system.\n\n8.8 Cooling / Heating Set Points\nInitially set to 23 and 21, respectively, the cooling and heating set points are the temperatures beyond which the\ntemperature control system is activated. By allowing these temperatures to increase and decrease, savings in the range\nof a few percent can be seen. Hotter climates where air conditioning can account for two-thirds of energy use will see\na significantly greater decrease in energy use if the interior is cooled to 25 instead of 23 degrees.\n\n8.9 Equipment efficiency\nAppliance use (small power) is a much-neglected factor in estimating the real energy use of a building. Set to a starting\nfigure of 25 W/m2 as a combination of appliance density and efficiency, it is multiplied by the daily operating hours and\ncan account for over 50 percent of the energy use of a building. Additionally, reducing the equipment heat gain will\nreduce the cooling demand, but will also increase the demand for heating during the winter. Limiting tenants’ choice to\nA-rated appliances should be discussed at the briefing stage, along with other measures that raise user awareness of\nthe energy use behind everyday activities.\n\n8.10 Hours of Operation\nIncreases in energy use are also attributed to extended hours of operation because of the internal gains from the hours\nof additional equipment load, occupancy, and lighting loads. This reflects the energy use of many buildings running\nat a significantly higher cost than anticipated. If operating hours are considered at the briefing stage, then controls\nand zoning of systems and spaces can be considered accordingly. Incorporating managed hours of use in tenancy\nagreements is currently being successfully piloted by leading commercial landlords.\n\n8.11 Carbon Factor\nCarbon factor, the multiplier used to convert energy use to CO2 emissions, depends on the emissions created at the\npoint of generation and any losses through transmission. Changing the carbon factor allows users to set the energy\nsource to any fuel type, including renewable energy sources.\n\nConclusions\nDesigners are often reluctant to get involved in the analysis of building performance, partly because of its technical\nnature, and partly, perhaps, because this is perceived to be the realm of specialist engineers who are expected to\nfind solutions to performance issues. Energy use in the past has been considered a mechanical issue, yet this paper\nsuggests that architects have a significant influence.\nThe team has found that well-integrated solutions bring the greatest benefits to the energy performance of tall buildings.\n\n138\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nSustainably Tall: Investment, Energy, Life Cycle\nSophisticated façade solutions can be wasteful without the analysis of orientation, together with the mechanical system\nemployed; the benefits of good daylighting can be ineffective without appropriate control systems. Natural ventilation\nin itself requires a particularly detailed coordination of all disciplines, as it requires façade and control systems that\nare more costly, and could alter the building’s geometry and efficiency, but it can significantly reduce the size of the\nmechanical system. More research is needed to quantify the trade-offs.\nCollaborative thinking is equally essential to address occupant energy use and user engagement, which typically\naccount for a third of a tall building’s energy use. Restricting hours of use, reconsidering the cooling and heating set\npoints, and improving the buildings management system through staff training can reduce energy use without using\nadditional resources. Briefing requirements such as added resilience, specific tenancy arrangements, and preferred\nventilation systems also have a major impact on energy performance, as well as on capital and whole-life costs.\nStructural performance was found to have little impact on operational energy use. Nevertheless, it is the largest\ncontributor to the embodied energy of a shell-and-core solution—internal finishes can have a greater impact over the\nlifetime of the building. Some of the most influential structural drivers in defining the parameters of a tall building were\noutside the remit of standard structural optimization. When the model was piloted in alternative locations, the availability\nof materials, labor constraints, and local construction techniques greatly influenced the choice of structural systems.\nThe authors are still in the process of validating the model against data from initial benchmark projects, but this model\nhas already helped communicate some essential steps for any design team (app. 3). All participating teams are set on\ncollecting more data on completed buildings to verify increasingly complex design scenarios against the model.\nA remarkable outcome of the Tall Building Model is that, despite the technical nature of the topic, clients and designers\nwho typically do not engage at this level were able to gain rapid insight into the underlying performance drivers of tall\nbuildings. Use of the model in live briefing and design situations has inspired creative input from across disciplines.\n\nContributors\nPeter Oborn – Managing Director, Aedas Architects\nChristian Derix – Head of Computational Design, Aedas Architects\nMatthew Kitson – Director of Sustainability, Hilson Moran\nRaj Achan – Business Development Manager, Hilson Moran\nTony Morris – Director, Hilson Moran\nNigel Clark – Technical Director, Hilson Moran\nAlan Cronin – Vertical Transportation Divisional Director, Hilson Moran\nChristopher Cummings – Associate, Hilson Moran\nMatthew Clark, Arup\nJan-Willem Breider, Arup\nBrian Smith – Partner, Davis Langdon\nNeal Kalita – Associate, Davis Langdon\nMichael Maclean – Researcher, Davis Langdon\nDr. Alex Amato – Associate, Davis Langdon\nDavid Weight – Consultant Specialist, Davis Langdon\nBarry Nugent – Partner, Davis Langdon\nPhilip Esper – Associate, Structures Value Specialist, Davis Langdon\nGary Moss – Partner, Davis Langdon\n\nReferences\nAnderson, J., and D.

Carbonbuzz\nAedas has, over the past three years, embarked on a practice-wide strategy to monitor the effectiveness of sustainable\ndesign solutions from design to operations. The practice offers post-occupancy evaluation to all clients as a matter of\ncourse, and contrasts design with actual measurements of building performance (Aedas Green Book and Green Tool\nAJ Honorable Mention 2008).\nAs the information gathered was collated, a dialogue between disciplines emerged to understand some of the reasons\nbehind the discrepancy between design and actual performance. This led to the development of other cross-disciplinary\ninitiatives, such as the CarbonBuzz project, which is the first collaboration between the RIBA CIBSE on sustainable\ndesign. The online platform allows designers to monitor, benchmark, and share energy use information of projects from\ndesign to operation (Aedas app.).\nThe CarbonBuzz project has contributed to broader industry recognition of the lack of data available in the public\ndomain (UKGBC comments, AJ, CIBSE, Building Design articles) to benchmark, assess, and verify project sustainability\nperformance, even when examining the most regulated indicator, energy use. This realization has since fed into the\ndevelopment of the UKGBC’s Code for Sustainable Buildings Task Group report, which aims to provide clarity on how\nto improve the sustainable performance of projects from acquisition to end of life, covering all building types from largescale master plans to refurbishments. A key proposal of this report is for the UK government to publish data relating\nto sustainable design performance, to enable research and benchmarking to take place in the construction industry.\nWithout this data, we will continue to lack the evidence necessary to support changes in legislation, and the true\nenvironmental impact of the buildings we occupy will remain restricted to the specialists.\n\nAppendix 2. Model Assumptions\nDan Jestico – Hilson Moran:\nBuilding services engineers are increasingly involved with the early stages of building design to optimize architectural\nform, with the aim of reducing energy usage and associated CO2 emissions. When sustainability is considered at the\nproject outset, the greatest gains in energy savings are possible at the lowest cost.\nThe input from Hilson Moran to TBM can be broadly broken down into five areas:\nLift strategy\nEnergy consumption and CO2 emissions\nSavings due to daylighting\n\n140\n\nFigure 10 MEP\nInterrelationship\nof Variables\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nSustainably Tall: Investment, Energy, Life Cycle\nPlant area requirements\nRiser area requirements\nIn order to integrate these areas into TBM, it was necessary to utilize the skills of mechanical engineers, electrical\nengineers, vertical transportation engineers, environmental engineers, and sustainability consultants.\nBased on the population, an approximation of the number of passenger lifts required was further subdivided into\ngroups of eight lifts, with each group of lifts serving as a separate, vertically stacked zone. Goods and firefighter\nlifts, based on institutional and UK building code requirements, supplemented the passenger lifts. The area required\nfor the lifts was used to define the core size and, hence, drove the iterative process of defining the building height\nrequired to obtain the desired internal area.\nThe energy and emissions modeling for TBM was initially investigated by working backwards from the final output\nfigures, given in kg CO2/m2 per annum. The number of input variables affecting this figure was considerable, as\nshown in the diagram (fig. 10).\nThe output from the energy modeling falls into five main categories:\nHeating\nCooling\nFans and pumps\nHot water\nLighting\nEquipment (not shown in previous diagram)\n\nThe hot water and equipment consumption are a direct function of the occupation density and, therefore, relatively\neasy to calculate, based on the model inputs. Where daylighting controls have not been included, the lighting load\nis also a direct function of the initial data input to the model.\nThe heating and cooling demand loads are a function of many different aspects of the building design, all of which\nare interrelated. For example, reducing the equipment heat gain will reduce the cooling demand, but it will also\nincrease the demand for heating during the winter. The most important aspects are listed below.\nFacade glazing G value\nFloor-to-floor height\nFacade percent glazing\nTotal internal heat gains due to occupancy, lighting, and equipment\nHeating set point\nCooling set point\nThe final energy consumption (and hence emissions) due to heating, cooling, and fans and pumps is then an\nadditional function of the building HVAC system selected.\nIn order to calculate the heating and cooling demand figures, it was necessary to define one equation that would\ngenerate the demand given the six inputs listed above. The equations for heating and cooling for eight different\nfacade orientations and an internal space were assumed linear for reasons of time and simplicity. Although tests on\nthe resulting equations showed that relationships were not strictly linear, the differences were small given the overall\nimpacts of the changes being studied.\nIn order to define the 126 coefficients required for the 18 equations, results from 126 experiments were obtained\nusing Dynamic Thermal Modeling (DTM). DTM consists of a transient computational simulation, which utilizes real\nweather data on an hour-by-hour basis. Variables such as external temperature, wind speed and direction, solar\nradiation, cloud cover, and humidity are used in conjunction with the building’s material construction and internal\nheat gains to provide results on the internal temperature, heating and cooling loads, and the amount of airflow\nthrough study zones.\nThe annual heating and cooling demand can now be defined for each of eight façade orientations, plus the interior on\na kWh/m2 basis. This information was then used to define the annual energy consumption of gas and electricity, which\nis dependent on the building HVAC system type. For the tool, the most common systems from the energy flow diagram\nhave been used. These are:\nFan-assisted VAV, displacement ventilation, and fan-coil systems\nWater- or air-cooled chillers\nWith or without heat recovery\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n141\n\nSustainably Tall: Investment, Energy, Life Cycle\nAlthough at this time, the number of systems is limited to three different HVAC system types, the intention is to develop\nthe tool to incorporate other systems, such as active chilled beams.\nTypical system efficiencies of the various system types are used to convert demand figures into consumption figures.\nThe consumption figures can then be converted into annual CO2 emissions, using conversion factors dependent on\nthe fuel used and electricity grid emission factor. Daylight modeling has also been employed to predict the annual\nenergy savings possible with daylighting controls. The zone daylight factor is calculated from the following inputs:\nDaylighting zone depth from facade\nDaylighting zone width\nFloor-to-ceiling height\nFacade percent glazing\nFacade percent frame\nGlazing percent light transmission\nThe daylight factor is compared to the required external luminance to calculate the percent savings in daylighting for\neach zone.\nThe effect of riser and plant space requirements on the building area efficiency was defined using a sliding scale\nbetween the minimum and maximum percentages of floor area required, based on previous project experience. User\nchoices based on various servicing arrangements, HVAC system selection, and required levels of resilience are scored\ndepending on the relative amounts of area required. These scores are then totaled and used to define the percentage\narea required by both plant and risers.\nJeroen Coenders – Arup:\nThe structural performance module generates a structure based on various measurements and characteristics of the\nbuilding, and on information on its environment, estimated dimensions for structural elements, and finally, estimates and\noutputs of material quantities required for the structure. However, these are not presented to the user, as they are not\npart of the key performances of a building; rather they are woven back into the model to influence other performance\nindicators such as cost and embodied energy. Furthermore, the structure has a large impact on the net-to-gross floor\narea ratio, as mainly the core dimensions impact the available floor area to the user.\nThe structural performance module uses a variety of techniques to estimate the core dimensions, from rules-of-thumb\nto analytical mechanics, as well as optimization and structural code-checking formulas. The estimates have been\nmade with the idea of “optioneering” in mind, which indicates a phase in the building design before design. The Tall\nBuilding tool will never to able to produce a fully optimized engineered design, as this would require detailed exception\npossibilities to optimize the performances. Such optimization grows rapidly in complexity, which current computation is\nnot able to deal with. Therefore, the user has to keep in mind that a certain amount of inaccuracy exists with the results\nof the tool.\nThe structural performance module has a variety of inputs. The general module provides the building dimensions as\nwell as measurements of the floor slabs and grid sizes (primary and secondary spans between columns). Furthermore,\nthe use of each floor needs to be defined. The user is then able to select two structural types. Both include a central\nconcrete core. One is composite floors with steel beams and columns, and the other is concrete flat slabs with\nconcrete columns, with optionally post-tensioning of the floors.\nThe structural performance module provides volume and tonnage information for steel, concrete and reinforcement\nquantities. These outputs can be totaled or split between the different parts of the model: floor slabs, beams, columns,\ncore, and foundation structure (fig. 11).\n\nAppendix 3. Notes for Briefing\nConsider designs that address user behavior and make the building easy to use and operate.\nForecast energy use to include occupant density and likely operating hours.\nStructural options should assess embodied energy per net area, and any solutions such as post-tension floors that\nincrease floor-to-ceiling height while lowering the floor-to-floor height.

Some obvious solutions for London include a high percentage of\nsolid glazing on east and west facades, triple glazed or louvered treatment on the south, and improved U values for full\ntransparency on the north façade.\n\n142\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nSustainably Tall: Investment, Energy, Life Cycle\n\nFigure 11 Structural\nassumptions\n\nEvaluate the spatial and energy use consequences of mechanical systems.\nAgree with client and include in Building Manual the requirement of A-rated appliances with controls by zoning, timers,\nor other sensors.\nInclude daylight sensor systems and zone lighting parallel to the building perimeter.\nAgree on a change of design criteria to allow user control of heating and cooling set points.\nEvaluate the appropriate daily hours the building will be in use.

A combination of ambitious intent and fast project schedules necessitates the use of advanced parametric tools\nto quickly solve complex problems, generate unique features, and automate parts of the design process.\nDesigners will utilize digital tools for a variety of purposes, which can be classified under two general categories. The\nfirst and most common application of the technology is within the category of rationalization and optimization. The tool,\nin this case, is limited to the role of a production device that aids the designer in efficiently solving complex design\nproblems. In more unique projects, the advanced technology acts as a generative tool and is an integral part of a\nworking design methodology. In this case, the design technology becomes more than just a tool at the designer’s\ndisposal. Rather, it has the potential to act as a critical lens for identifying new possibilities in the architecture.\n\n144\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nParametric Strategies in Civic Architecture Design\nWhile still early in implementation, advanced digital tools are being more readily deployed over the course of the design and\ndelivery phases in varying degrees. The projects exhibited in this paper are identified and evaluated as benchmarks for how\nparametric and generative tools are used within NBBJ’s civic practice. Further, the projects are suggestive of a roadmap for\nhow future projects can integrate these digital tools and techniques within the broader design and delivery process.\n\nIntroduction\nIn the midst of an increasingly uncertain global economy, architects are seeking new ideas and design processes to\ndifferentiate their design product and gain competitive advantages within the market. The latest advances in digital\ndesign technology are at the forefront of this conversation by fundamentally redefining how architecture can be\ndesigned, documented, and constructed. First, advanced tools offer a means to improve efficiency in the designdelivery process by allowing designers to more easily manage complex project information. Second, new design\ntechnology offers opportunities for innovation by giving the designer the ability to expand the possibilities of buildable\nforms through new design and fabrication processes (Shelden 2006).\nFor NBBJ Los Angeles, the area of practice in which advanced digital technology is becoming the most influential is\nwithin the civic market. The demand for ambitious civic design ideas from clients, city officials, and the public allows\na greater degree of freedom to explore and experiment with new processes, forms, and design techniques. At the\nsame time, the complexities associated with various practical considerations require the use of more advanced\ntechniques to efficiently automate and manage the design challenges at large scales.\nCurrently, digital technology is leveraged in two ways within the design process. More commonly, advanced digital\ntechnologies are used for the purposes of rationalization and optimization. The advanced digital toolsets in these\ninstances are used purely as a means to support the design idea, while the technology is placed in a supporting role.\nThis is often extremely effective from a production standpoint; however, the full potential of the digital techniques to\ninform design thinking is rarely achieved.\nIn more unique cases, opportunities for utilizing the generative capabilities of advanced design software are identified,\nand the digital tool acts more as a critical lens for generating new architectural possibilities and for evaluating the\nproject. When digital technology is able to operate in this mode, design ideas evolve out of a system of project rules\nand constraints. This process-driven approach allows for the design logic established within the early phases to be\ncarried seamlessly into the design development and construction phases of the project. Further, this form of design\nprocess will often require the invention of new tools and techniques in the form of scripts and macros, enabling a\nmore open-source attitude towards digital technology, accompanied by an interest in going beyond appearance and\ninto the design of processes (Kieran 2005).\nUsing several case studies, this paper outlines the range of influence advanced digital tools are having within the\nNBBJ Los Angeles design studio. While still early in their implementation, advanced digital technology is being more\nreadily deployed over the course of the design and delivery phases in varying degrees. The case study projects are\ntreated as a roadmap for the continued integration of advanced tools and customized workflows within the design\nprocess in order to strike a new balance of both efficiency and innovation.\n\n2 Kintex Exposition Phase II\nFigure 2 Kintex roof\ngeometry\n\nThe Kintex Exposition Center Phase II is a winning NBBJ\ndesign competition entry located in South Korea (fig.\n1). Programmatically, the building holds six convention\nhalls, a multipurpose hall, and a mid-rise office tower.\nThe building is sited as two convention wings on the\neast and west that flank two exterior plazas and are\nconnected by an atrium space. Conceptually, all\nprogrammatic elements are tied together by a continuous\nroof form, which splits and undulates to modulate light\nand to conform to interior volumetric requirements (fig.\n2). In terms of the digital design processes, various\nparametric modeling techniques became a means to\nquickly develop, rationalize, and detail the conceptual\nsurface into a developed 3D model under the umbrella\nof the overriding design concept.\nThe first modeling challenge was the articulation of a long-span roof truss that conformed to both the free-form curving\nroof geometries and the engineer’s structural sketch (fig. 3). To accomplish this, the initial B-spline geometries that\ndefined the roof surface sweeps were used as a starting point for structural articulation. Each B-spline was subdivided\ninto equal point lists and then cross-connected to create the truss edges. These lines were then subdivided further\nto articulate truss chords and cross members. Since the geometries were associated with one another, further\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n145\n\nParametric Strategies in Civic Architecture Design\nfeedback from the engineer regarding depth and module increments could be quickly accounted for within the model.\nAdditionally, changes in the overall geometry for design purposes could be easily made without needing to manually\nremake portions of the model.\nFigure 3 Modeling\nof the long-span\nstructural system\n\nThe second challenge was the curtain wall design and the ability\nto iterate through several detailed variations of patterns that\nemerged from the combination of structural and glazing systems\n(fig. 4). The initial surface from the conceptual model was used\nto drive the curtain wall geometries. The surface was divided into\na modular grid based on the UV parameters of the surface to\nallow for the propagation of standard components comprising\nthe structure, mullions, and glazing panels (fig. 5).\nWhile this propagation technique is now a fairly standard\noperation within parametric modeling software, the challenge\nwas the precise coordination of the three different systems being\ndriven from one surface (fig. 6). The necessary offsets, material\nthicknesses, structural depth, and density had to be taken into\naccount for the successful systematization of the design.\nAs a benchmark project within the studio, the Kintex Expo\nprovides an example for integrating parametric techniques in a\none-directional manner within the design process. The short time\nframe of the competition and the late integration of the technology\ndid not allow for any degree of feedback to occur between the\ndesign intent and the tools. The tools were, therefore, always at\nthe service of the design but never the reverse.\nFigure 4 Developed\ncurtain wall system\nwith structure,\nmullions, and glazing\npatterns\nFigure 5 Articulating\nthe model using\nsubdivision and\npanelization\ntechniques\n\nFigure 6\nCoordinated structure\nand mullion systems\nfrom one surface\n\n146\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nParametric Strategies in Civic Architecture Design\nFigure 8 Torus\ngeometry\n\n3 Shell Stadium\nThe Shell Stadium is one of several design studies for an international stadium\ncompetition. The primary challenge of the competition was to create a flexible\nstadium design that could shrink or expand its capacity between 30,000 and\n70,000 seats over the course of its life span, while still maintaining a strong\niconic image. Shell Stadium is composed of two large shell-like forms that\ntwist up from the ground to become the stadium roof (fig. 7). Conceptually,\nthe shells would act as a self-supporting staging area under which the stadium\nbowl and retail functions would be free to modulate their program sizes. From\nthe standpoint of implementing parametric tools, Shell Stadium offered several\nunique opportunities in the areas of formal rationalization of the roof form and in\nthe creation of a system for generating multiple bowl prototypes.\nThe stadium shell concept allowed for an investigation into the potential of using\nrationalized mathematical geometry as a design driver. To start, the concept was\nloosely sketch-modeled using free-form NURBS surfaces. However, given the\nbudgetary constraints outlined in the competition requirements, it soon became\nclear that there needed to be a way to develop the curvatures in a more rigorous\nmanner. Torus geometry was chosen as a starting point because of its ability\nto achieve controlled doubly curved shapes while still maintaining standardized\nFigure 9 Slicing out\na torus section was a\nmethod for defining a\nroof shape\n\nFigure 10\n2D fabrication files of\nrib and panel systems\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n147\n\nParametric Strategies in Civic Architecture Design\nquadrilateral panel modules (fig. 8). The use of\ntorus geometry as a rationalization technique\nhas precedent in architecture design, most\nnotably in the work of Sir Norman Foster and\nthe Specialist Modeling Group (Peters 2008).\nThe mathematical properties of the torus allow\nfor more efficient manufacturing and production\nof architectural elements such as structure and\nsurface materials (Shodek et. al. 2005).\nVarious irregular profile curves were intersected\nwith the torus geometry in order to find an\noptimal torus surface section that curved from\na vertical condition to a horizontal one (fig. 9).\nFrom the torus section, structural ribs and\npanels were generated for further study into\nthe structural and skin systems. The use of\nthe mathematical geometry within a parametric\nmodeling environment also allowed the design\nteam to efficiently coordinate 2D laser-cut files\nof the curving structure and panel systems\n(fig. 10) and quickly construct various physical\nstudy models (fig. 11).\nThe programming of the variable seating layouts was a unique opportunity for devising a parametric system to\nstudy bowl shapes, seating capacities, and configurations. An in-house bowl generator was scripted based on\ntypical stadium conventions (John et. al. 2007) for the creation of two- or three-tiered bowl sections, derived from\nthe calculation of optimal sightlines (fig. 12). The script sweeps the bowl section along a specified plan curve to\ncreate an up-to-date 3D representation (fig. 13). The user is able to adjust parameters such as the number of rows,\n\nFigure 11 Study models\nwere assembled\nusing 2D fabrication\nfiles derived from the\ntorus geometry\n\nFigure 12 A stadium\nbowl generator\ndeveloped in-house\nusing parametric\nsoftware\n\nFigure 13 Stadium\nbowl prototypes\noutputted from the\nparametric system\n\n148\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nParametric Strategies in Civic Architecture Design\nFigure 14 The\nHangzhou Stadium\n\nFigure 15 An early\niteration of the\nB-spline copy-mirror\nprocess used to\nderive the exterior\nshell concept\n\nthe distance from the playing field, and the sightline standards. Other critical\ndesign data such as seating capacity estimates, riser angles, and 2D bowl\nsections are also outputted to the user.\nThe Shell Stadium is an example where feedback between a design idea and the\ndigital tools moved the design process forward; it also set an example for how\ngeometry could be rationalized and fabricated. Further, the creation of the bowl\ngenerator has proven to be a valuable tool that can be reused on multiple stadium\nand arena projects.\n\n4 Hangzhou Main Stadium\nThe Hangzhou Main Stadium is an 80,000-seat multipurpose stadium located in\nHangzhou, China. Originally planned as the venue for the National Games for the\nPeople’s Republic of China, the stadium is now conceived of as a premier sports\nvenue for the rapidly expanding city of Hangzhou (fig. 14.). For the NBBJ LA studio,\nthe Hangzhou Stadium is a benchmark example where parametric thinking was\nintegrated into the early design stages and then advanced as the design became\narticulated within a developed model. The execution of the stadium also draws from\nmany of the strategies outlined in the previous projects and coordinates them into\none parametric system.\n\nFigure 16 Early\nstudies of the\nstadium structure\nand modularity\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nFigure 17 A recent design\niteration of the stadium geometry\nfrom the parametric model\n\n149\n\nParametric Strategies in Civic Architecture Design\nThe exterior of the stadium was conceptualized\nas a series of unique yet repetitive truss\nmodules (affectionately referred to as “petals”),\nwhich enclose the stadium bowl. The original\ngeometric concept was derived from a study\nof 3D, symmetrical B-spline patterns, resulting\nfrom a rigorous copy-mirror process about an\nelliptical stadium shape (fig. 15).\nSince the process followed a set of loosely defined\nrules, multiple iterations and variations could be\ngenerated and evaluated from the standpoint of\naesthetics and proportion. After a decision was\nmade on a visual effect, the geometry underwent\nan optimization process in order to conform to a\nseries of constraints driven by structural, modular,\nand programmatic parameters (fig. 16). The\nprimary challenge of the optimization process was\nto effectively translate the winning competition\nconcept into a flexible parametric system that\ncould take into account different geometric\nconstraints, as well as have the ability to grow and\nadapt for future design development (fig. 17).\nThe original concept model was used as a starting point, and, in turn, the inner and outer limits of the geometry were\n\nFigure 18 Associating\nthe petal profiles\nwith the stadium\nbowl sightline and\nriser parameters\n\nFigure 19 Establishing\nthe parametric\nassociations around an\nelliptical shape using\ninstanced truss sections\nand control points\n\ndefined in section. From these limits, points were mapped which would act as control points for B-spline curves. These\ncurves are used to define the primary truss cross section (fig. 18). Multiple instances of the primary truss and the curve\ncontrol points were then reoriented perpendicular to the elliptical stadium curve. This method allowed the primary\ntrusses to maintain the same sectional dimensions around the entire stadium. The petal profiles were then described\nfrom the same set of instanced control points that have been shifted in key places within the section and elevation. The\n\nFigure 20 Different\nmodular variations were\nstudied by changing\nthe amount of primary\ntruss instances around\nthe stadium ellipse\n\nresult was a customized petal geometry that was relational to the primary, regularized truss structure. The petal surfaces\nwere modeled as a series of developable surfaces connecting two adjacent petal rail profiles. Limiting the geometry to\ndevelopable surfaces is of particular importance when considering how the petal shapes would eventually be unrolled\nfor manufacturing purposes (Shodek et. al. 2005). The curve geometry defining the trusses and petals were further\nsubdivided to achieve the cross-bracing and lateral support centerlines (fig. 19).\n\n150\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nParametric Strategies in Civic Architecture Design\nFigure 21 Structural\ncoordination within the\nparametric model based\non a concept provided\nby the engineer\n\nSince the stadium geometry is associative, the design team is now able to efficiently study alternatives within the new\ngeometric constraints and in keeping with the original design intent (fig. 20). As the stadium bowl geometry changes\n(utilizing the bowl constraints, for example), the outer form can now quickly adapt to a new plan and section. Further,\nfeedback from consultants and engineers is able to be absorbed within the system by branching off the original\ngeometry to add further detail and articulation (fig. 21). The advantages of this system are numerous, but the primary\ngains are the ability to preserve design intentions independent of any given geometric iteration and the elimination of the\ncost associated with generate-test-discard models of design practice (Sheperd 2006).\nAs an ongoing project in development, the Hangzhou Stadium acts as a benchmark for integrating parametric ideas\nand tools at all levels of the design process. As the design process of the main stadium moves forward, the goal is to\nhave parametric modeling continue to be the primary means of developing the design, as well as to transmit the design\nintent to the local architects, engineers, and clients in China.\n\nConclusions and Future Possibilities\nThe use of parametric modeling tools in varying degrees is beginning to gain momentum within NBBJ’s Los Angeles\ndesign practice. Specifically, the ambitious design criteria associated with civic projects has necessitated the use of\nadvanced parametric modeling to effectively design with the complex constraints of programmatic, structural, and\ngeometric concepts.\nIn the case of Kintex Expo, the digital tools are used as a means to efficiently build and coordinate complex design\npieces, such as curtain walls and structural systems within the 3D model, using propagation and subdivision\nstrategies. While this method of computer modeling is not a new technique, the recent implementation within the\nNBBJ studio has expanded the studio’s design possibilities by enabling designers to more efficiently describe and\nvisualize complex systems and relationships.\nIn the case of Shell Stadium, customized tools and processes have been devised within the studio to aid in solving\ncomplex and recurring design problems. The stadium bowl generator developed for the Shell Stadium has allowed\nfor the rapid creation of stadium prototypes on various stadium projects. Rigorous rationalization techniques using\nmathematical geometries have allowed for explorations into the fabrication and prototyping of complex forms and\nstructures. Developing these unique processes has spurred the creation of a digital tools library so that as new\ntechniques are discovered and invented, they can be developed and customized for use on various projects.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n151\n\nParametric Strategies in Civic Architecture Design\nThe Hangzhou Stadium serves as an example of utilizing a generative approach to digital techniques by developing\na rule-based methodology to drive the project from early conception into design development. Since the design was\nparameterized into a flexible yet precise system of constraints, the design team was able to take a comprehensive\napproach in solving the geometric and engineering problems, as well as efficiently study design alternatives grounded\nwithin the design intent.\nUltimately, as advanced modeling tools and techniques become more widely used within the design studio, the\ndesign of the digital process becomes just as important as the design of the projects themselves.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis paper would not have been possible without the contributions and support of the\nNBBJ Los Angeles design studio.

Ostwald\n\nThe University of Newcastle, Australia\n\nChris Tucker\n\nThe University of Newcastle, Australia\n\nStephan Chalup\n\nThe University of Newcastle, Australia\n\nAbstract\nPlanar methods have typically dominated the computational analysis of architectural and urban space and form.\nFor example, the majority of space syntax research that has been undertaken over the last three decades has been\nconcerned almost exclusively with architectural and urban plans. In contrast, analytical methods that consider the\nformal, or visual, qualities of architectural façades, or images of buildings, are not only rare, but only a few have\never been repeated and adequately tested.\nThe present paper outlines a new method—derived from the Hough Transform algorithm—for the dissolution\nof architectural images into segmented lines that can be counted and charted, and that can have their spatial\norientation determined. This method for investigating the visual qualities of buildings is demonstrated in an analysis\nof a series of images of suburban houses. The proposed method, line segmentation, is potentially significant\nbecause it is a method not commonly used for the quantitative analysis of the formal and textural character of real\nbuildings, it is repeatable, and it delivers consistent results if a simple procedure is followed.\n\n1 Introduction\nThis paper describes the application of a new computational method for the analysis of the visual qualities, or\nformal complexity, of architectural façades. Past works on element and boundary detection in façade analysis\n(Stamps III 2003; Malhis 2003) have inspired this new method, “line segmentation.” However, while these past\nworks have relied on manual techniques (typically the tracing of overlays on photographs), the present research\ndescribes the preliminary results of a computational extrapolation of these methods that uses the Hough\nTransform algorithm to automate the process of identifying patterns within complex or fragmented images. The\nauthors have developed a program for line segmentation analysis that works as a module of their prototype\nArchimage software for the visual analysis of architecture.\nThis paper provides an overview of past attempts to quantify objectively the visual qualities of architecture.\nThe paper then describes the new method, some of the limitations identified by the authors, and the line\nsegmentation results for some typical suburban dwelling façades. The purpose of this paper is not to provide\na comprehensive presentation of the method and its programming code, or to provide extensive evidence of\nits efficacy, but, rather, to offer an overview of the line segmentation concept and to suggest ways in which it\nmight be usefully applied.\n\n2 Background to Quantitative Architectural Visual Analysis\nObjective and quantifiable methods for the analysis of character and complexity in architectural façades are relatively\nrare (Stiny 1975; Stamps III 1999, 2003). A small number of methods have been proposed over the last four decades,\nbut few of these have ever been repeated, and only one has been adopted and tested by multiple researchers. For\nexample, Krampen (1975) famously used a technique known as parsing to calculate the diversity of elements within\nthe façade of a building. By overlaying a grid on an image of the façade, he was able to manually count the instances\nwherein a particular element was present within each cell and, thereby, produce a mathematical determination of\nfaçade diversity (fig. 1).\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n153\n\nLine Segmentation: A Computational Technique for\nArchitectural Image Analysis\nFigure 1 Dissolution\nof a Façade into Four\nLayers of Elements\n(Krampen 1975)\n\nRather than using an analytical grid, Elsheshtawy (1997) traced layers over photographs of buildings to uncover what\nhe believed to be the “bounding surface” of each visual component of a façade, and then grouped these together,\nbased on their relationship with other elements. He then derived a value for complexity within the façade from the\nnumber of groups formed at each layer or level. In a similar way, Imamoglu (2000) manually traced photographs of\nbuildings and then manipulated them to produce drawings of the same building with different levels of visible detail.\nHowever, rather than producing a numerical calculation of visual character, Imamoglu surveyed people and asked\nthem to rank each façade based on the desirability of its formal complexity. Designs that were highly complex or that\nhad excessive numbers of unfamiliar elements were generally more negatively regarded.\nSalingaros (1997) proposed a simple method to establish the visual character of a building’s façade. Adopting,\nlike Krampen (1979) before him, a variation of the concept of entropy, Salingaros proposed that façades might be\nmeasured by their “temperature.” Salingaros then manually applied this method to twenty-five buildings; Klinger and\nSalingaros (2000) later refined this method to provide a measure of the “structure” or “complexity” of abstract visual\narrays. Malhis (2003), like Elsheshtawy (1997), suggested that a more objective measure of the visual character of a\nbuilding façade could be determined by recording the detail within the façade of each dwelling at different scales, or\non what he calls, “layers.” In his method, a thin line represents the shapes and forms within each layer, defining the\nfeature. A professional assessor would then examine each façade to determine where the layers occur. Malhis used\nthis manual system to classify 230 villas into eleven stylistic groups.\nWhile the techniques of Krampen (1979), Elsheshtawy (1997), Salingaros (1997), Imamoglu (2000), and Malhis\n(2003) are all important, in that they seek to produce objective and quantitative methods for analyzing façades, they\nalso all rely on time-consuming manual techniques and on various levels of personal judgment. However, a parallel\nset of approaches has been developed under the auspices of space syntax research, and while these methods have\nachieved a slightly higher degree of objectivity, they, too, have had only limited success and application.\nWhile space syntax researchers have typically rejected the importance of the third dimension (the façade) of the built\nenvironment (Batty and Rana 2004), a few techniques have, nevertheless, arisen from this field. For example, Hillier\n(1996) proposes that building façades may be conceptualized as an arrangement of shapes that are defined by the\nground-plane, but which are perpendicular to it. Hillier represents a building’s façade as both a “metric tessellation”\nand as a diagram of “the dominant elements in the façade.” Hillier then outlines the possibility of developing a “façade\nisovist” as a way of interpreting the relationship between a public space and the façades of buildings that define or\ncontrol this space. In essence, the façade isovist is a supplementary technique for shaping and informing planar\nanalysis. Teller (2003) has suggested an additional approach to the topic of façade analysis: He examines the threedimensional openness of streetscapes and town squares by creating a two-dimensional image from a wide-angle\nview, looking vertically towards the sky. He then focuses this method on the “statistical distribution” of building heights\nand façade features, as observed from a fixed point.\nOne of the few analytical methods for investigating the visual qualities of façades that has been tested and repeated\nby multiple researchers is the “box-counting” approach to fractal analysis. This method, the architectural version\nof which was first presented by Bovill (1996), determines the fractal dimension—a measure of characteristic visual\ncomplexity—of an architectural façade. Since that time, the manual version of the method has been repeated\nmultiple times (Bovill 1997; Bechhoefer and Appleby 1997; Burkle-Elizondo, Sala, and Valdez-Cepeda 2004), and a\ncomputational variation has also been developed and tested (Ostwald, Vaughan, Tucker 2008; Ostwald, Vaughan,\nChalup 2009). While the benefits of this method are yet to be convincingly demonstrated, it, nonetheless, has the\nadvantage that it is repeatable and, in its computational form, provides a robust determinant of the visual complexity\nof a façade.\n\n3 Line Segmentation Method\nJust as space syntax researchers (Steadman 1983; Hillier and Hanson 1984) have shown that there is much to be\nlearned from the analysis of room relationships in a plan (regardless of dimensionality) or in spaces that are visible\nfrom a single point in space (the isovist), so, too, can a range of façade details be productively examined in isolation\nfrom their associated plan. Elements in an image are defined by edges, which are typically boundaries dividing similar\n\n154\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nLine Segmentation: A Computational Technique for\nArchitectural Image Analysis\nsections of an image. Because much of the built environment is orthogonal in plan, the majority of edges identified in\nany visual analysis of architecture are effectively lines. While significant effort has previously been invested in various\nmethods for understanding the elements in a façade, very little time has been focused on the nature of the lines that\ndefine these elements (Stamps III 2003). In particular, no one appears to have asked the simple question, how many\nlines are there in an architectural image and how long are they?\nOne reason for this lack of interest in this question may relate to the labor-intensive nature of the process of uncovering\nthis information “by hand,” and that past computational approaches to image analysis have had a relatively low\nsuccess rate for line detection and segmentation of this type. This is because in the real world, a myriad of features\ncomplicate the computer’s capacity to “read” a building. Every shadow cast by the sun, trees, shrubs, parked cars,\npower lines, and passing pedestrians will fragment the view of a building and its façade. However, a recent technique\ndeveloped by computer scientists, known as the Hough Transform, has a previously unavailable capacity to extract\ndiscontinuous geometries and patterns from complex, real world images (Song and Lyu 2005).\nThe Hough Transform is important for line segmentation analysis of real world images, because it is at least partially\nable to mimic the human mind’s capacity to seek spatial order in complex environments. For example, when\nconfronted with a long white wall, with a thin, red pole standing in front of it (and continuing in height above the line\nof the wall), the human eye will easily determine that there are two elements in space: a wall and a pole. Even the\nmost advanced image-detection software has problems with this simple situation. The computer will typically identify\nthree elements: two white walls and a red pole. If the pole has cast a shadow, the computer may find four elements.\nThese errors—or more correctly, “pedantic” readings—occur because computers cannot easily be programmed to\nmake logical spatial connections when given discontinuous data.\nThe Hough Transform is different in this context because it uses a novel “voting” approach to determine if there is\na high likelihood that there are deeper patterns in an image; it then identifies these in much the same way that the\nhuman eye does. However, the human eye can also be fooled, and the Hough Transform still possesses the typical\ncomputational flaw of being over literal in its readings. For example, the Hough Transform will record the head of a\ndoor that also lines up with the head of a nearby window as a single line of cumulative length. The human eye may\nalso intuitively read a façade in this way, even if the mind understands that the door and the window are separate\nelements. Thus, the Hough Transform represents a major advance in complex image analysis, but it is still not\nperfect. It is, nevertheless, ideal for the consistent analyses of lines detected in photographs of building facades.\n\n4 Application of the Method\nLine segmentation is the process wherein the complete set of edges within an image are measured and counted,\nnoting their orientation (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal), but ignoring their connectivity to other lines or elements. A line\nsegmentation algorithm was authored for the present research and embedded in existing Archimage software. The\ncomputational approach for producing a line segmentation graph is as follows.\n1) A digital photographic image is created as the primary data for the method. Typically, these images will provide a\ncomplete view of the façade of a building from a point perpendicular to the façade, and will have been taken in relatively\nneutral lighting conditions (to minimize the impact of shadows) (fig. 2).\n2) The image is imported into Archimage, which uses\na Sobel edge-detection algorithm to remove color\ninformation from the data, and which produces an\noptimized “line drawing” of the original image (fig. 3).\n3) Archimage then applies the Hough Transform\nalgorithm to the line drawing to identify discrete\ncontinuous sequences of pixels and seemingly\nconnected discontinuous sequences of pixels (in\nessence, identifying and isolating every line in the data).\n4) The number of lines in the image and their\norientation are counted.\n5) A graph is produced of the results, recording\nline count (frequency) on the vertical axis and line\nstrength (length in pixels) on the horizontal. The data\n\nFigure 2 Raw Data\n(Façade Image)\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nFigure 3 Edge Detection\n(Sobel Method)\n\n155\n\nLine Segmentation: A Computational Technique for\nArchitectural Image Analysis\n\ncan be reported either as a single set of results (the set of all lines) or divided into vertical lines, horizontal lines, and\ndiagonal lines (fig. 4).\nTo this point, the process is automated. However, to construct a comparison between multiple images, a scale must\nbe manually set.\n6) To set a scale, an element in the image must have a known dimension. For example, in figure 1, a typical dwelling\nimage of 640 x 480 pixels, the door height is around 105 pixels, which means that, in this image, a single pixel is around\n20 mm in length. This allows the operator to set an approximate scale for each image that, in turn, allows multiple\nimages to be compared.\n\nFigure 4 Line Count\nGraph (Subdivided\nby “All” and by\nOrientation)\nFigure 5 Scaled\nVersion of the Line\nCount Graph\n\nFor a comparison between the results of different images, a modified chart has been developed (fig. 5). This graph\nrecords the intersection between the length of various isolated lines in the original image (x-axis of the graph), and the\ntotal length of such sets of lines (of the same length) when they are added together (y-axis); this is called the boundary\nlength. The number of lines of a given length is found by dividing the total boundary length by the isolated line length.\nVariations on this approach for presenting the data have been tried, but few have the advantage of being able to be\nread so easily as this cumulative approach.\nA typical graph is read as follows. In figure 5, at the left edge of the x-axis, when all of the 400 mm long lines in the\noriginal image are added together, they produce a 60m long boundary (60,000 mm in the y-axis); this means that there\nare around 150 lines in figure 1 that are around 400 mm in length. At the right-hand edge of the x-axis in figure 5, the\ntotal length of lines that are 3200 mm long, is 6400 mm; this means that there are only two lines of this length in the\noriginal figure.\n\n5 Discussion\nConsider two suburban houses, the\nfirst, a “traditional” Federation-style\nhouse (approximately 70 years old),\nand the second, a “modern” terracestyle house (approximately 10 years\nold) (figs. 6 and 7, respectively).\nBoth of these images are subjected\nto line segmentation analysis and\nthen to manual scaling to overcome\ndifferences in size; the results are\ngraphed together (fig. 8). The result\nfor the former house is the upper\nline in the graph, and the latter is the\nlower line.\nFigure 6 “Traditional”\nDwelling\n\n156\n\nFigure 7 “Modern”\nDwelling\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nLine Segmentation: A Computational Technique for\nArchitectural Image Analysis\n\nFigure 7\nLine Segmentation\nResults for Traditional and\nModern Dwellings\n\n• For the traditional house, a line segmentation analysis reveals a total range of line lengths of between\n600mm and 4000 mm. The shortest lines, the 600 mm ones, are repeated in the image around 133\ntimes. Given that the image includes a traditional picket fence that is almost 600 mm high and has around\n60 pickets (each of which generates two lines), this result conforms to expectations. There are also around\n40 x 1200 mm lengths in the image, 25 x 1600 mm lengths, and around 15 x 2000 mm lengths. Some of\nthese numbers are slightly higher than anticipated, but the density of detail, screening, and ornamentation\nin the traditional house probably leads to the Hough Transform finding slightly more discontinuous lines than\nthe building actually possesses.\n• For the modern house, the line segmentation analysis reveals a total range of lines between 500 mm and\n3450 mm and a graph that is, at all points, below the graph for the traditional house. In essence, the\nmodern house has fewer lines of all sizes in its façade and setting. Whereas the traditional house had 40,\n25, and 15, respectively, of each of the lengths 1200 mm, 1600 mm, and 2000 mm, the modern house\nhas 10, 4, and 2 times these lengths. This result reflects a much lower level of detail in the modern house,\nor a lower level of visual complexity across all scales of detail.\n\nConclusion\nAs part of the development of the line segmentation approach, the authors have tested over 100 photographs of\ndwelling facades. While these preliminary results are not yet ready for statistical analysis and publication, they begin\nto suggest that certain architectural styles and types are able to be identified, at least in part, from a calculation of\nthe number and length of lines present in each façade.\nThe great strengths of this approach are that it will produce consistent, quantifiable, and objective results from a\nsimple digital photograph. The key challenges that remain for the authors are in two areas:\n1. The Hough transform, like the human eye, can find patterns that do not actually exist in an image; in essence, it\nis capable of connecting lines that are only accidentally adjacent. While this is not a critical problem—the lines are\nalways consistently produced even if there are inaccuracies—it nevertheless calls for further refinement.\n2. The graphical method for presenting and analyzing the results is still under review. A simple graph of line length\n(how long) to line number (how many) may be desirable, but it does not reveal a pattern that the eye can easily\ncharacterize or compare. The method presented here, of charting line length (how long) to composite boundary\nlength (all of these lines added together), produces a graph that is more intuitive to read, but the authors are still\nseeking a better alternative.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n157\n\nLine Segmentation: A Computational Technique for\nArchitectural Image Analysis\nAcknowledgments\nTHIS RESEARCH WAS UNDERTAKEN WITH THE SUPPORT OF AN ARC DISCOVERY GRANT: DP0770106.\n\nReferences\nBatty, M. and S.

When pushing the envelope on geometric complexity, architects and engineers\nmust begin a dialogue early on in the design process and communicate effectively throughout. Using digital models for\ncommunication, visualization, and analysis creates additional digital information that may need to be shared. Middleware\nprovides interoperability between different software packages and facilitates the exchange of information. However, this\ndoes not exempt the partners from maintaining traditional lines of open communication.\nThis paper will discuss the importance of open communication and demonstrate a strategy for sharing digital information.\nThe case studies that will be presented are taken from design projects whose geometric complexity required close\npartnership between design team members. Effective communication will first be discussed in the context of three\nsculptural concept designs. Second, the interoperability of digital models will be discussed through a case study of a\ncomplex, faceted super-tall high-rise tower.\n\n1 Central Cove\n\nFigure 1 Central\nCove Renderings\n\nArchitects and engineers are often creatively constrained by the perception of economy in conventional designs. For\na development called the Central Cove, the client envisioned a community unlike any other. This mandate freed the\ndesign team to grow sculptural expressions into paradigm-shattering building concepts. Figure 1 provides renderings of\nthe three individually sited concepts advanced within the architectural team: Matrix Gateway Complex, Crystal Center,\nand Wings Museum.\n\n(Matrix Gateway Complex)\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n(Crystal Center)\n\n(Wings Museum)\n\n159\n\nData Flow and Communication in the\nDesign of Complex Architectural Forms\nEach structure would be large—up to three million square feet of occupancy and over 20 stories tall. The programming\nfor each project varied, but multi-use was expected. The Matrix Gateway Complex would provide residents a full 3-D\ncity experience, featuring suspended platforms linking modular housing and community venues. The Crystal Center\nwould be one of many structures in a radically re-envisioned Arts Center. Finally, the Wings Museum would offer the\nhighest quality hotel and museum experience within a structure, and appear to skim over the sea like a bird in flight.\nOnce the basic sculptural forms were realized, structural engineers were invited to evaluate the designs and propose\nmeans of structural support. In a familiar rectangular building with load-bearing columns and walls, structure is fairly well\nunderstood by architects and engineers alike. However, the proposed designs challenged the conventional wisdom\nby omitting instinctive means of support and lurching the building to an unprecedented length of cantilever. Despite the\nconceptual differences, three issues remain paramount in the mind of the structural engineer: providing a rational gravity\nload path, resisting applied lateral loads, and ensuring complete system stability.\nThe team members recognized that engineers and architects approach building design challenges with a different\nhierarchy of concerns. Through the schematic phase of such projects, the work of engineer and architect proceeds\nalong parallel lines that converge toward a viable solution. A failure by either party to communicate changes results in\ndivergence of the lines. Furthermore, in the schematic design phase, revisions happen very quickly. There is a time lag\nbetween architectural information being sent to the structural consultant and actionable information being returned to\nthe architect. When structural advice is ready, the architecture has already changed.\nNew software tools help to close the gap. Interoperable model formats help communicate changes in form and reduce\nthe delay between the sending and receiving of comments. In each of the Central Cove projects, the engineers were\nable to generate analytical models directly from the architect’s models. However, shared software tools demand an\nopen dialogue and a set of ground rules, especially when defining complex shapes with splines and arcs or when\nsetting control points. Ultimately, the team must work together to find effective solutions.\n\n2.1 Matrix Gateway Complex\nDesigned as both an urban gateway and a self-sustaining city, this 42-story prototype would be one of the greenest,\nmost aesthetically striking and technologically innovative mixed-use buildings in the world. A 180-meter cube designed\non an 18-meter grid, the prototype contains many of the compo­nents of a great urban center: a hotel with fitness and\nconference centers, retail and office spaces, cultural and religious facilities, and waterfalls surrounded by lush green\nterraces. Each component would take the form of a moveable module, connected to one of five central cores, all of\nwhich would be visible from the outside through a semi-transparent exterior skin.\nThe initial concept required that the entire structure be supported on four concrete cores. Columns on the grid would\nnot extend down to a foundation, and beams were expected to span 18 meters. The engineers recognized that finding\nan effective load path would be the principal concern for the design of the structure.\n\nFigure 2 Matrix Gateway\nComplex Interior\n\nEarly expectations were that the entire structure could act as a gravity load-resisting moment frame—meaning that\nthe column to beam connections would provide stiffness. The structure would cantilever away from the cores.\nHand calculations indicated that the span of the beams was too great to permit this concept. Instead, the engineers\nproposed including large hat trusses in the top stories of the structure (intended for mechanical and energy generation\nequipment), from which the rest of the structure would hang. To address the engineers’ initial comments, the architects\nrevised the program density of the building, moving more units toward clusters around the core. They also shared the\nRhino model containing the floor plate layout. With this data, the engineers could accurately assess the distribution\nof the floor loading. After a few data conversions, the information was uploaded to an analysis program and several\nschemes were quickly evaluated.\n\n160\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nData Flow and Communication in the\nDesign of Complex Architectural Forms\nAs initially suspected, the moment frame concepts yielded unacceptably large steel sections. However, the hat truss\nconcept was found to be viable. In the end, a combination of moment frames, hat trusses, and inter-story trusses was\nproposed to facilitate a stable load path for the structure. The final structural hurdle involved the asymmetrical layout of\nthe cores. Both teams compromised on their initial schemes, resulting in the inclusion of an additional steel core that\nwould support a corner of the cube from below.\n\nFigure 3 Crystal\nCenter Section\n\n2.2 Crystal Center\nIf a tectonic shift in an undersea geological formation sent giant crystals thrusting up through the water’s surface, it might look\nsomething like this dramatic arts center prototype, positioned in a lake or a harbor. Eleven jutting, crystalline structures of varying\nsize—with cantilevers of up to 230 feet over the water—are joined at a base largely concealed beneath the surface.\nInside the structures, the cantilevers create stunning interior spaces from which occupants will enjoy extraordinary\nviews, while experiencing a sense of being suspended above the water. The cantilevered roofs also allow the building\nto shade itself in a hot climate, which, in turn, allows for greater transparency in the glass curtain walls beneath.\nInitially, the Crystal Center concept appeared to be the most straightforward structurally. Despite its challenging geometry, a\nrational framing plan using standard members was anticipated. The intent was to support the cantilevering point of the structure\nwith a prop that extended down to the foundation. Chord members (top or bottom members of a truss) would run along the\nmajor facets, forming a shell-like structure that defined the top of the tapering shape. Several rows of columns would be hung\nfrom the exterior truss, while other columns extending to the foundation would lean up to meet the superstructure.\nAfter considering lateral wind and earthquake forces, the structural system was reconsidered. The engineers were\nconcerned about not only general stability, but also the amount of movement that would occur at the point of the form.\nThe level of uncomfortable sway was estimated by first computing the period of the structure, or the time it would take\nfor one complete cycle of swaying movement. A damper would be required in the structure to mitigate the motion.\nWorking within the basic architectural form, the engineers suggested near-horizontal trusses in the top exterior facets. At\nlower levels in the building, an internal braced frame (x-braces) was also recommended to link the floor diaphragms to the\nexterior trusses, as well as to assist in torsional resistance. These systems complement the unique inclining concrete core.\n\n2.3 Wings Museum\nStanding 40 stories tall and boasting a wingspan of 300 meters, this structure would be counted as a wonder of\nthe modern world. Inside, visitors would be treated to multiple cascading levels of museum space and extravagant\naccommodations. Each gallery would be five stories tall with a continuous light-well extending the full height of the\nbuilding. Hotel corridors would ring the high atriums at intermediate levels between the galleries.\nThe form was developed through a progression, from sketches to clay and paper models to graphical renderings using\nRhino. When the engineers were first invited to review the concept, the architects were curious about how a structural\nsystem would be derived. Considering the most efficient means of supporting the sweeping cantilevers, the engineers\nrecommended an exoskeleton design. Such designs have recently been utilized at the Hearst Tower in New York and\n30 St. Mary’s Axe (The Gherkin) in London. In each of those cases, closely spaced floor-to-floor members that intersect\ndiagonally form an exterior tube. The result is a continuous grid of diamond-shaped segments known as a diagrid. This\nconcept is very efficient because it combines gravitational and lateral structural systems. This also provides a more\ncolumn-free interior. From an aesthetic standpoint, the diagrid uniquely allowed for a fluid expression of the structure\nat the façade.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n161\n\nData Flow and Communication in the\nDesign of Complex Architectural Forms\nDeveloping the diagrid layout requires close coordination between engineers and architects. On this project, the\narchitectural team took ownership of the diagrid. Early schematic models showed the visual effect of a diagrid but\nlacked the precision necessary for structural analysis. Grasshopper, a graphical algorithm editor tightly integrated with\nRino’s 3-D modeling tools, was used to assign the parameters and automatically generate a more rational mesh from\nthe sculpturally modeled forms. Figure 3 provides an illustration of the Grasshopper algorithm.\n\nAfter generating a suitable diagrid mesh, the architects shared their wireframe Rhino model with the engineers. Since\ncare had been taken to make sure that all of the members intersected at discrete nodes, the model parameters could\nthen be directly imported to Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software for structural analysis with minor modifications.\nAlthough the initial FEA model ran successfully, results indicated that member sizes had become disproportionately\nlarge and uneconomical.\n\nFigure 4 Wings Museum\nGrasshopper Algorithm\n\nBased on the large member sizes and programmatic constraints, the architects proposed alleviating some of the\nfloor loads by opening up large portions of the floor plates. Multiple-story tall atria were introduced. Implementing\nthe changes in Rhino allowed the engineers to quickly asses the structural impact. The required size of the exterior\ncolumns had improved but still did not provide the optimal design. Through a series of iterative analyses, the engineers\nrecognized that the diagrid members were not sufficiently braced against out-of-plane bending and buckling.\nLateral and gravitational loads induce horizontal forces in the diagrid; therefore, the diagrid needed to be braced at\neach floor. The magnitude of this outward force increases proportionately to the load carried in the diagrid, so greater\nresistance is required near the base of the structure. The floor slab diaphragm frequently provides adequate bracing\nstiffness. However, the large interior atria planned in the Wings Museum resulted in slender horseshoe-shaped floor\nplates for four out of every five floors.\nThis concern was immediately discussed with the architectural team. They pointed out that the demising walls between\nthe hotel rooms could be utilized structurally. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the engineers proposed buttress\ntrusses to span vertically between the gallery floors. Similar in concept to the buttresses used on Gothic cathedrals,\nthese trusses carried the horizontal force components from the diagrid to the stiffest floors. Deep atrium trusses and\nring beams stiffened the gallery floors. The atrium trusses served a dual purpose: providing column-free spans up to\n250 feet and linking opposite edges of the floor plate. The ring beams resisted the net horizontal tension conveyed\nfrom the diagrid, much like the ring beams used at the base of large domes. Tension forces are the greatest where the\nangle of change in the floor plate is greatest.\nThe final piece in the structural puzzle was dealing with the sharp changes in geometry that occurred at a few principal\nedges of the floor plate. Members placed at these corners became collectors for load. Consider a single continuous\nline of diagrid members: They track diagonally across the building, shedding little load until intersecting a collector. The\ncollectors receiving compressive forces were naturally the largest members in the design. To moderate the size of these\nmembers, a second, smaller diagrid was specified on the interior side of the hotel floors.\nThis progression of advanced structural concepts took place at an exceptionally accelerated pace. Though each\nof the concepts is individually well understood and had been applied with precedent, this specific application was\nonly realized through a series of analytical models. The engineers were able to hit the ground running early in the\nproject because of the verbal and digital communication facilitated by Grasshopper, Rhino, and SAP 2000—from\nconcept to graphic model to analytical model. To close the circle, Revit structure was used to graphically illustrate\nall the structural systems.\n\n162\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nData Flow and Communication in the\nDesign of Complex Architectural Forms\nFigure 5 Illustration of\nWings Museum Data Flow\n\n3 Faceted High Rise - Meraas Tower\nThe design of super-tall high-rise towers provides many unique challenges for all disciplines involved. Most notable\nis the coordination and communication between all design professionals. In today’s fast-track design industry,\ncommunication of information needs to be efficient, but most importantly, it needs to be interoperable. As mentioned\nin the other case studies, architects and engineers work on different software platforms throughout the life of a project.\nThe most important aspects of the communication between consultants are efficiency of data transfer, reliability of data\nflow through different software platforms, and informed decision making. Software and procedures in this case study\ndemonstrate the flow of communication in the schematic design phase.\nLike a prism, the 112-story super-tall tower has a series of faceted surfaces that increase light and air travel through\nthe building. The faceted shapes maximize energy generation, balance natural light, and offer 360-degree views. The\narchitectural form also creates natural atrium spaces as the building ascends. These atriums allow for the creation of\nnaturally lit sky gardens that activate the tower’s form. Vertically segregating the tower program gives the illusion that the\nstructure is composed of four smaller towers stacked on top of one another, creating a “vertical city.” The connection\nzones between vertical segments house the fuselage openings that contain wind turbines and air vents that pass\nthrough the body of the tower. Figure 6 provides a rendering of the tower.\nThrough early collaboration, engineers and architects proposed a tower system that utilized the faceted architectural skin\ngeometry to create an external structural megacolumn and diagonal-brace framing system. This system is comprised of a\nhighly efficient assembly of steel and concrete elements to achieve the stringent design requirements of a super-tall tower.\nIn addition to the planar faceted tower skin, the fuselage openings have an impact on the structural solutions proposed.\nThe architectural form was massed in Rhino. This software platform allows architectural forms to be rapidly adjusted\nto present the best and most current design intent. For the architectural form to become the structure for the tower,\ngeometric rationalization was performed to establish the relationship between external geometry and internal structural\nelements such as columns, slabs, and the interior core. Grasshopper, as the additional interface of Rhino, was used\nto develop this parametrical system. This interface allows the relationship of the geometry to structure, exterior skin\nfaceting, tower height, and updates to the numbers of tower floors to be parametrically editable per design needs.\nFigure 7 shows an illustration of the geometry variations per different program needs.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n163\n\nData Flow and Communication in the\nDesign of Complex Architectural Forms\nRationalization processes were developed to establish the key control media. Key control media are constraints set in\nthe parametric algorithms. These constraints, such as facet line relationships to the structural system, control the way\nthe tower geometry is updated. Control media­–driven geometry updates provide an efficient method for coordinating\nchanges between the architect and the engineer.\nFigure 6 Meraas\nTower Rendering\n\nFigure 7 Tower Variation\nin Geometry\n\n(Tower Height Change)\n\n\n(Adjustment of Exterior Faceting)\n\nFor Meraas Tower, a series of the control points was selected and became the control media to generate the architectural\nform, as well as to be easily transferable to the engineer’s information modeling platforms, Revit and FEA software. This\ninformation is then used to (re)create/model structural components utilized in the finite element analysis for lateral and\ngravity load design. Figure 8 provides an illustration of the geometry rationalization outline of the Rhino-Grasshopper\ninterface. Different projects would develop different control media, such as cross-section profiles, plan paths, etc., to\nprovide optimal design control. Appropriate and wise control media are key aspects for design interoperation, both\nwithin each discipline and between architects and engineers.\n\n164\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nData Flow and Communication in the\nDesign of Complex Architectural Forms\nSoftware that allows live data to be transferred is also paramount for improving efficiencies in communication\nbetween consultants. Both the architect and the engineer can then perform more efficiently and give appropriate\ndirection for the project.\nFigure 8\nIllustration of\nRhino-Grasshopper\nInterface\n\nStructural engineering for the tower is predicated upon the concern for overall strength and stiffness in resisting lateral\nloading, both wind and seismic. As previously mentioned, an exterior diagonalized frame, over multiple stories and\nconnecting a limited number of composite steel/concrete megacolumns, which extend along the entire height of the tower\nwithout interruption, provide resistance to lateral load. By utilizing the entire exterior dimension of the tower envelope, a\nhighly efficient system is potentially realized. Diagonal and inclined vertical members of the perimeter system are organized\nalong the facet lines of the architectural surfaces. A system of reinforced concrete core walls is oriented about the elevator\nand stair shafts in the center of the floor plate. These core walls provide local resistance to the global multi-story perimeter\nstructure, as well as additional shear and torsional stiffness to the tower as a whole. At the three fuselage openings through\nthe body of the tower, minor intermediate steel columns along the perimeter are interrupted. A continuous perimeter steel\nbelt truss is provided at each of these locations in order to facilitate the intermediate steel column erection and further\nstiffen the perimeter structure. One of the challenges was to adjust the architectural faceted form to maximize the structural\nsystem efficiency while maintaining the aesthetics.\nFigure 9 Illustration\nof Meraas Tower\nData Flow\n\nAn alternate structural system with exterior concrete\nmegacolumns at near vertical facet lines, interconnected by\nexterior concrete moment frames along the perimeter, was also\ninvestigated. Typical office and hotel floors are framed in structural\nsteel beams, with composite steel deck and cast-in-situ concrete\nslabs. The floor beams are designed in composite fashion, with\nthe deck slab through conventional headed shear studs. For\nthe hotel floors, floor beams are spaced at 4.5 meter centers\nto match the room widths and partition lines. In the all-concrete\nstructural system, a mixture of concrete beam and one-way slabs\nand two-way flat plate slabs were utilized for the floor framing. The\ntower megacolumns and core wall system are supported on a\npiled raft foundation. Piles are high capacity, straight shaft, large\ndiameter bored reinforced concrete piles.\nThe integration of these structural systems into the architectural\nexpression was critical to the overall design of the tower.\nCommunication of the geometry was conducted through multiple\nsoftware platforms. Figure 9 provides an illustration of the building\ninformation data flow through different software packages.\nThe communication of advanced building information is critical for\naccelerating project design, constructability, and the construction\nschedule. Being able to visualize complex three-dimensional\nbuilding components like the connection of the steel diagonal\nbraces to the concrete megacolumns before structural detailing\nstarts is paramount. Figure 10 provides an illustration of critical\nstructural connections detailed in TEKLA.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n165\n\nData Flow and Communication in the\nDesign of Complex Architectural Forms\nFigure 11 shows a study of the geometric transformation for the tower megacolumns at fuselage levels. These are\ncomplicated and critical design details for interior space planning, exterior wall geometry, and structural efficiency. After\narchitectural parameters are transferred into the structural model, analysis data would be used to design and define the\nactual three-dimensional structural elements.\nFigure 10 Steel\nDiagonal/Megacolumn\nConnection (TEKLA)\n\n(Elevation)\n\n(Plan-Section)\nFigure 11 Concrete\nMegacolumns at Fuselage\n(Opening) Levels\n\n(Fuselage – Zone 2)\n\n(Fuselage – Zone 1)\n\nConclusions\nSoftware cannot make the final decisions. However, communication through the live transfer of data between software\nneeds to be at the forefront of the design process in order to make timely decisions and to give key direction for a project\nwith geometric complexity. Once this direct link in communication has been established, managing and organizing the\ndata flow is critical. This is accomplished by establishing key control media that is appropriate for the project, and\nthat is understood between all design professionals. Efficient communication also requires an understanding of the\nadvantages and disadvantages of different software platforms, so that the appropriate platform for different design\nissues at different design stages can be utilized. In short, design professionals must close the circle.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors of this paper would like to recognize the efforts of Marco Aranda, Philip Bussey, Geoff Dauksas, Chris Ewrin,\nLee Ishida, David Schweim, David Weihing, and Hao-Jan Wong for their contributions to the projects in this paper.\n\n166\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nDigital Templates:\nDiagrams of Associations\n\nJulie Flohr\n\nUniversity of Illinois Chicago, OISSE Architects Inc.\n\nAbstract\nThis paper claims that a speculative design space exists within the crafting of digital rule-based associations in\nparametric modeling environments, which promises to support potent contemporary designs in architecture. In addition\nto reviewing some diagrammatic frameworks located within the techniques of associative design modeling, this paper\nalso details a project for a research-oriented practice based on the development of a registry of digital diagrams called\n“re-usables.” Working with “re-usable templates” of association, a precise sequence of design logic is invented for each\nproject, while some of its aspects are re-used and re-configured. Such practice aims to operate between the “one-off”\nworld of the all-custom and the entirely reproducible world of “copy-paste.”\n\nIntroduction\nThis paper seeks to position parametric design both as an agent of change in architecture and as a support of\nspeculation in design. While parametric models have primarily been perceived as most useful in addressing complexity\nand money-management issues and, thus, have gotten a bad rap in academic circles, this paper reclaims the\nsignificance of parametric design in regards to design methodologies.\nThis review of the operating frameworks intrinsic to associative design attempts to reveal and exploit their constitutive\nproperties. At the same time, this paper advances the significance of digital jigs and the associated concept of re-usable\ndigital templates. “Re-usables” are sequences of recorded operations that, like a diagrammatic chart, may be adapted, may\nevolve, or may mutate in order to address a range of conditions similar to the ones for which they were initially intended. For\narchitects, this suggests a shift from a commission-based practice organized around the production of one-off projects to\none that develops an inventory of jigs and “re-usables” that anticipate a range of architectural problems and commissions.\nThough architects have traditionally sought the efficiency and expediency of re-using details for material assemblies,\ndigital templates present a different potential for the discipline. They suggest an entirely new speculative, variable, and\nprovisional design space able to take on both intrinsic design criteria while simultaneously anticipating a range of extrinsic\nconditions. The potential of these methods is illustrated with examples of student work produced in both studio and seminar\nenvironments. Two additional examples illustrate the broader applicability of these techniques in architectural practice.\n\nREVIEW OF ASSOCIATIVE ENVIRONMENTS AND THEIR THEORETICAL\nIMPLICATIONS\n1.1 When Geometry associates to geometry\nIn an environment that fully supports associative modeling, all geometric objects are defined in the digital model,\nenunciated through both geometric and mathematic rules. Associative modeling keeps track of the interdependencies\nwithin a given model—a model that has been constructed through long sequences of interdependent geometries\nwhose behavior is regulated by rules. For example, one can create a representation of the geometric theorem of\n“the witch of Agnesi” as a curve, described as flowing, through points obtained from the intersection of two lines,\nconstrained by the laws of the theorem (see fig. 1). The relationships are the model. There has been little conversation\nin the field of architecture about the design implication such a setup offers. It is definitively new to architects that a model\nis not a throw away, and the questions shift to which types of relationships are meaningful to the architectural project.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n167\n\nDigital Templates: Diagrams of Associations\nFigure 1\nConstruction in digital\nproject of relationships of\nthe theorem of the witch\nof Agnesi\n\nDiagrammatic invention here has to do with thinking through the relationships of geometry within the model: their type,\ntheir order, their grouping, their degree of insularity, and their repeat pattern within the tree or an area of the tree.\nThe shear quantity of information produced by the relationships in such a model needs to be managed carefully, which\nleads into the discussion of the role and significance of data in these models.\n\n1.2 When data associates to geometry and geometry associates\nto data\nThere are two possible scenarios in this association between data and geometry that bear consequences for\ndiagrammatic thinking. One is an association where a data set dictates the position or characteristics of the geometry\nlike the values of coordinates, length, area, volume, mass, etc. In this case, the code flows from the data to the\ngeometry. Data is the input of the model and geometry the output. The other possible association consists in collecting\ninformation from the geometry in the model and producing a tabulated representation of it—where the information\ncollected is specific to the purpose of the model. In this case, the code flows from the geometry to the data. The\ngeometry is the input and the data the output.\nThe implications of data sets as the “inputs” of geometry for contemporary diagrammatic possibilities for the field of\narchitecture are twofold:\nFirst, data allows the geometry in the model to be abstracted and conceptualized numerically. Numbers are becoming\npart of the representation within the design project: numbers materialize—this has been engineer and mathematician\nCecil Balmond’s project and contribution. Further, this means that the many and diverse abstract mathematical\nquantities developed in the sciences are now available for actual manipulation by architects. Architects no longer have\nto discuss scientific models as an idealized condition that any given project, at best, simulates but, rather, may integrate\nthem into the inner workings of a project.\nIf we elaborate on the example of working with the mathematics of the “witch of Agnesi” curve, a lotus pod may be\nmodeled not as the formal reproduction of the lotus formation but as the as the “mathematical function associated to\nits growth (fig. 2).\nSecond, a data set is a renewable, mutable quantity. Hence, a given geometrical model whose input is a data set is\nconstantly in flux. The model is a provisional condition with many possible actuations or virtual conditions. Architectural\ncritic Michael Speaks speculates that Excel is the tool that allowed financial speculators to create an understanding of\n\n168\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nDigital Templates: Diagrams of Associations\n“projected value.” A data table represents not only the present condition, but also, most importantly, the “projected”\ncondition or “anticipated” condition of value, producing dramatic changes in the financial world. In architecture, this\nidea of the provisional model has implications for how architectural design, as a value system, might similarly be\nreorganized. This is not simply because we are able to optimize complexities and quantities and, thus, overall building\ncosts with the provisional model, but, rather, because such a model allows for a range of outcomes that share an\nintelligence base given a particular criteria (fig. 3). This is well known to the fields from which associative modeling\nsoftware comes: the aerospace, automotive, and industrial design industries all reuse models and understand them to\nbe templates that are effective at dealing with a range of conditions that may present themselves in the future, albeit in\nslightly altered manners. However, the field of architecture is yet to capitalize on this idea. A practice whose organization\ncapitalizes on categories of models and techniques is presented in the third part of this paper.\nFigure 2 Model of a\nlotus pod utilizing a curve\ndefined by the “witch of\nAgnesi” function\n\nFigure 3 Provisional\nlotus pod models. Four\ntypes of parametric\nbehaviors may be\nmanipulated within\ntheir specific range,\nproducing a unique\nprovisional condition\nof arrangement that\nis informed by any\ncombination of the 4\nparametric behaviors.\n\nWhen data is extracted from the geometric\nelements of the model and organized\nthrough tabulation, it is observed that\nthe diagrammatic consequences are as\nfollows: the moment such abstract data\nis able to collected, ways to optimize\nare imagined. Data may be formatted to\nundergo evaluation cycles to determine\nhow well it performs under certain criteria.\nThe performance will be measured either\nnumerically or graphically; both methods\nallow the design team (or the computer,\nin the case of automated processes)\nto adjust the initial assumptions of the\ngiven geometry in the model to create an\noptimization cycle. Software packages\nincreasingly\ncollapse\nparametric\nmodeling, optimization, and analysis\ntools and interfaces. The potential\nhere for design invention is not that\narchitects may replace the structural or\nenvironmental engineers, but, rather, that\nthey may invent new criteria and experiment against them on their own early on in the design process, possibly inventing\nnew types of assemblies, materials, and environmental conditions. Architects, while developing their own calibrated and\ndisciplined set of intuitions, may start using models in novel ways. Being able to conduct and observe an experiment in the\nform of a digital simulation will augment the intuitive understanding of the forces at play in a given model that has previously\nbeen understood with traditional analog tools and human aptitude.\nIn this student work example for a Parisian outdoor market cover, the students collected data about daylight\nthroughout the year and produced a pattern in response to their findings. Further, they exploited the color spectrum\nof light that relates to the four seasons. This is an example where analytical and performance considerations led to\nthe invention of a new material order that orchestrated the spatial qualities of the market (fig. 4).\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n169\n\nDigital Templates: Diagrams of Associations\nFigure 4\nChoreographed color\nand light patterns for a\npublic market: Color as\nmodel\n\n2 STRATEGIC PATTERNS IN ASSOCIATIVE ENVIRONMENTS\nWithin the exposed technical possibilities and potential diagrammatic associations for architecture described above,\nwe may be able to identify strategic patterns that manage meaningful links between geometry, data, evaluation\nmethods, and computing. What constitutes an interesting pattern in setting up parametric digital models? Are there\nsome systematic organizational logics or tactics that offer a productive, speculative, and experimental framework to\nan architectural project?\n\n2.1 Jigs\nA jig is a simple abstract framework that isolates a parametric behavior from the complexity of the larger model.\nIn the article, “Some patterns for parametric modeling” by Robert Woodbury, Axel Kilian, and Robert Aish,\nthe authors propose three frameworks for making parametric patterns: jigs, an organized collection of points,\nand component placeholders. They suggest that these techniques be combined in the making of parametric\nmodels. These frameworks are, indeed, powerful because they categorize types of abstraction that relate to\ntypes of architectural problems.\nFigure 5\nOf particular relevance to the idea\nTranslation of a\nof re-usables is the analogy of a\nphysical jig into a\ndigital jig to a physical jig used in\ndigital jig\nphysical construction. A complex\nphysical assembly may be broken\ndown and aided by jigs that\nperform and control a particular\ntask. Within the setup of the jig,\none has to orchestrate the proper\namount of control in anticipation\nof the complexity of its assembly\nwithin the whole. An effective jig,\naccording to the authors, is one\nthat “appears and behaves like a\nsimplified version of the end goal,\nhas relatively few geometric inputs\n(or controls), and its internal structure captures the intended behavior.” A well thought out physical jig may be used to\naid in the construction of similarly complex situations. We can conceptualize a digital jig in the same manner. Hence, an\neffective framework for a pedagogical exercise is the translation of physical jigs into digital jigs (fig. 5).\n\n170\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nDigital Templates: Diagrams of Associations\n2.2 Relationship between parameter set-up and parts to whole\nrelationships in architecture\nParameters link the characteristics of one entity to the other. Parameters might be intrinsic to the jig, as in local\nparameter, or extrinsic to the jig, as in global parameter. When a parameter is internal to the jig, the modulation within\neach jig is unique to that jig; when it is exterior to the jig, all the individual modulations are yet again controlled globally,\nthus, producing variation that is both specific to the unit and in relationship to the whole (fig. 6).\n\nFigure 6 Effects of\nlocal parameters\nand global\nparameters on jigs\n\nGrasping the implications of this notion of types of control, local versus global, and when to actuate one versus the\nother is crucial to the production of new architecture that would elaborate on the traditionally split position of either\nordering the detail in the service of the overall form or letting the overall form dictate the detailing. Architect and\ntheorist Greg Lynn correctly foresees the promise of parametric tactics for the discipline of architecture to be “the\nability to fuse the hierarchy of parts and whole to produce a deeply modulated whole as well as infinitesimal variation\namong parts,” thus, working within the collapse of bottom-up and top-down hierarchical order.\n\n3 DEPLOYING ASSOCIATIVE PATTERNS\n3.1 Re-Usables\nThe promise in the elaboration of digital jigs is that they are\ninfinitely re-usable, as they may be adapted to address\nproblems that are similar to the one for which they\nwere initially intended, like in an evolutionary process.\nFor architects, this suggests a shift from a practice\norganized around making one-off projects once they\nhave secured a commission to a practice that develops\nan inventory of jigs or “re-usables” in anticipation of\ncommissions, thus, mimicking the provisional qualities\nof a financial data sheet. “Parametrics” is the medium\npar excellence for a speculative practice.\n\n3.2 Registry\nIn anticipation of the reuse of certain digital techniques\nor jigs, a registry is created, recorded, and archived.\nA jig is then activated to serve different projects in\na unique iteration, inscribed within its “provisional\nstate” or hybridized with another. The activity of\ndesign manages the logistics machine and works\nat organizing templates, or repertoires of patterns,\ntapping their potential for activation as spatial and\nstructural configurations. Practice becomes organized\naround the generation and management of these “re-usables.” The precise assembly of the design logic is invented\neach time, while some of its aspects are repeated and re-configured based on previously developed strategies that\nhave been captured, recorded, and archived.\n\nFigure 7\n\nIn this example, for rendering a facet of geometry planar with the help of a jig, three student proposals using the\nsame basic jig setup produce three different versions of work. The same jig was at play: based on four given points in\nspace, three will always belong to the same plane; the fourth point will not be and, therefore, will need to be projected\ninto the plane defined by the three other points (fig. 7).\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n171\n\nDigital Templates: Diagrams of Associations\n3.3 Creating a registry of digital diagrams in the context of\nteaching\nIn the context of teaching advanced design studios and special topics seminars, a pool of digital diagrams is created.\nThe pedagogical framework consists in researching a rule-based physical manifestation that may be studied and\nanalyzed. Based on the analysis and understanding of the rules at play, students are asked to transpose the rules\ninto, first, a physical model and, second, a digital model. The analog observations students have made while\ndeveloping the physical models were critical to understanding tactics and frameworks for digital parametric models.\nThese tactics led the students to propose a digital jig for their model, making their models re-usable in the future;\nthus, they participated in the creation of a pool of digital templates.\nThe most productive results were projects that not only achieved the transposition of the rule set into a digital model\nbut also invented a new condition that emerged as a result out of doing so. Several of these projects have already\nbeen illustrated in this paper.\nFigure 8 L-system\nbranching system\nshowing 4 iterations\nof branching\n\nFigure 9\nLynden Meyer\nbranching\nsystem as a\n“re-usable”\ntemplate–\nbridge project\n\n3.4 Practicing is an opportunity to test the idea of registry\nThese two examples from practice utilize branching as an underlying diagram to different ends. Based on an L-system,\na recursive pattern of splitting is produced. The basic rule for each step is as follows: based on a line L1, a new line L2\nis placed at its endpoint, at an angle relative to it, and of a length that is a function of the length of L1. This process is\nrepeated n times (fig. 8).\nIn the example for the Bloomingdale line revitalization, a system of variable urban infrastructure becomes a series of\nbridges. The splitting informs the quality of the structure of the bridge, which relies on structural redundancy created\nby the accumulation of the splits. The discrete changes in the geometry of the splits, in turn, may inform the overall\ntrajectory or deviation of the bridge. Bent steel tubes designed to bend only in one direction construct the splits (fig. 9).\nIn the example for a luxury chocolate retail boutique, splitting has transformed into a rather leaflike texture that informs\nthe interior skin of the retail space, filtrating views, engaging the visual and tactile senses of customers, making for\na complete sensory experience (taste and smell are produced by the chocolate merchandise). The splitting here\nmaterializes as a laser-cut, two-dimensional pattern (fig. 10).\nThe point these two projects make is that, based on a singular diagrammatic matrix, splitting, the actualization of\nsplitting, is inflected by the program, site, and conditions inherent to the project. The underlying parametric model is\nre-usable yet affords specificity.\n\n172\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nDigital Templates: Diagrams of Associations\nConclusion\nProvisional modeling, the term coined by Michael Speaks, projects parametric modeling beyond the purely technocratic\nenvironment and has implications that support the architect in the anticipation of design. Hence, this platform in\nsupport of visionary architecture goes far beyond the assumed roles of efficiency in management-oriented tasks\ntraditionally associated with the word “parametric.” The environment of parametric modeling works to support visionary\ncontributions. Design anticipation may be developed through the making of digital “re-usables” and may form the basis\nfor a speculative practice.\nFigure 10 Lynden\nMeyer branching\nsystem as a “reusable” template\n– interior retail\nskin project\n\nParametric environments may be the catalysts bringing about accelerated changes in the intuitive ability of architects\nto grasp criteria in conducting performance analysis and in their own experiments, both digitally and with analog tools.\nArchitects are collaborating with specialists in their respective scientific fields to form computational performance\nanalysis study groups. More importantly, for the discipline itself, architects are inventing new combinatory interdisciplinary\nconditions that produce a new set of material and physical effects. This result emerges from the fact that parametric\nmodeling environments collapse geometric modeling with various types of scientific data. This newly accessible data\nthat architects can now manipulate at will has highlighted physical and material conditions that may not have traditionally\nbeen put to use in the field of architecture. A good example of this is looking at air, light heat, or sound as abstract\nmaterial models whose behavior at the molecular level is becoming increasingly relevant to the architectural project.\nLastly, though computational frameworks for conducting performance analysis with digital simulation are increasingly\npowerful, many problems remain unsolvable either computationally or due to computational thought-space not yet\ninvented. The physical observation method for developing intuitive frameworks of thought (jigs) has historically proven\nto be very effective. Look to the work of Antonio Gaudi’s loaded string models that best approximate the mathematical\nproperties of catenaries curves or Frei Otto’s soap films that best approximate minimal surfaces. This paper suggests\na commitment to studying the physical phenomenon as a way to reflect upon and best anticipate the rules and\norchestration of the parametric digital model. The pedagogical framework presented here focuses on the translation of\nthe observed physical behavior into a digital system, and is intended to be a reproducible model for practice. While the\npaper presents jigs in physical material terms, it is foreseeable that jigs will become increasingly abstract and requisite\nto the formulation of the architectural project.\n\nRefErences\nBernard Cache, Towards a non standard mode of production, in Objectile: Fast-wood: a brouillon project,\n(Consequence SpringerWienNewYork Verlag, 2007), pp 26–39.\nDaphne Golden and Melissa Hanzsek-Brill, the witch of Agnesi, Dept of Mathematics Education EMT 669, University\nof Georgia.\nIngeborg M Rocker, Calculus-based form: an interview with Greg Lynn, in Folding in Architecture (Wiley-Academy\nEditions, 1993 revised edition 2004).\nMichael Speaks, guest lecture at UIC, Spring 2009.\nRobert Woodbury, Axel Kilian, and Robert Aish, Some patterns for parametric modeling.\n\nIMAGE CREDITS\nIllustration 1, 2, 3: Lyndsay Pepple, UIC School of Architecture\nIllustration 4: Renee Colino, UIC School of Architecture\nIllustration 5, 6: Gheeta Pedapati, UIC School of Architecture\nIllustration 7: Marco Veneziano, Renee Colino and Giedre Garkauskaite, UIC School of Architecture\nIllustration 8, 9, 10: Julie Flohr, Oisse Architects Inc.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n173\n\nParametric Acoustic\nSurfaces\n\nBrady Peters\n\nCentre for Information Technology and Architecture (CITA),\nRoyal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture\n\nAbstract\nAcoustics are important performance criteria for architecture; however, architects rarely consider them, except, perhaps,\nwhen designing concert halls. Architectural spaces can be said to perform well or poorly in terms of their acoustic\nqualities. The volumetric geometry of a room as well as its surface characteristics determine the acoustic quality of\na space. Acoustic engineering research has proposed several new types of surfaces that can alter the acoustics of\narchitectural spaces in different ways (Cox 2009).\nBy altering the geometry or material characteristics of the surfaces within a room in specific ways, the acoustics can be\ncontrolled. Once the geometric rules governing these acoustic alterations are understood, these rules can be encoded\ninto a CAD system through parametric modeling or the use of computer programming. The architectural designer\ncan then generate acoustically regulating surfaces according to desired performance criteria. In this way, acoustic\nengineering links to architectural design, and allows architectural design to become acoustically performance-driven.\nThis paper considers three primary types of acoustic surfaces: absorbers, resonators, and diffusers. Complex surfaces\nthat combine these three performance characteristics in different ways are proposed. The relationship of geometry and\nmaterial to the physical properties of sound is discussed, as is how parametric systems and computer programming\ntechniques can be used to generate new types of acoustically regulating surfaces.\n\n1 Introduction\nIn order to use sound as a driver of design, we must be able to measure and understand the acoustic consequences of\nour geometric actions. New methods must be developed to create geometry that achieves specific acoustic conditions.\nGenerally, architectural designers are unfamiliar with discussing sound, and they lack the terminology to speak of the\nexperience of sound, or the scientific principles of acoustics. There are limited drawing conventions in place to sketch\nacoustic concepts, and the physical models that architects develop are used rarely, if ever, for acoustic testing. No CAD\nsoftware exists that combines both sound and geometry. An architectural designer interested in developing acoustic\nconcepts as part of an architectural design will have difficulty finding tools to aid in this task. This paper demonstrates\nand proposes new tools and solutions that enable acoustics to become an architectural design problem. Through\nthe investigation of how architectural surfaces such as walls, floors, and ceilings can be designed and detailed to be\nacoustically regulating, we were able to develop new design tools that include sound as a generating parameter for\narchitectural design. The projects discussed in this paper integrate computer-based acoustic simulation with parametric\ncomputer-aided modeling techniques to develop complex surfaces that, through their shape and material, can be part\nof an acoustically well-balanced space.\nAs architects, we primarily focus on the visual, and we understand a great deal about designing with light; however, our\nsonic environment is critically important as well. The “aural environment elevates or depresses our affective responses, it\nbears directly on our sense of privacy, intimacy, security, warmth, encapsulation, socialization, and territoriality” (Blesser\nand Salter 2007). As light illuminates our visual environment, sound sources illuminate our sonic environment. The\ngeometry and materiality of the architecture that surrounds us modifies our sonic experience. Human activities produce\nsound, and our architecture constantly interacts with us through its modification of the sounds we create. Much of the\n\n174\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nParametric Acoustic Surfaces\nmusic produced today utilizes electronic filtering to create a desired ambiance or effect; however, music producers also\nuse the acoustic characteristics of physical spaces as a way of altering sound (Reinemar 2009). Architecture is the filter\nthat modifies the sounds that we create.\nA critical characteristic of sound is that, unlike light, the speed of sound is perceptible. The sounds of the past exist\nsimultaneously with the sounds of the present. We notice this in the phenomenon of echoes or reverberation time.\nThe science of architectural acoustics began with the work of Wallace Sabine. He determined that the reverberation\ntime, the time it takes sound to decay to inaudibility, was the most important factor determining the acoustic quality of a\nspace. He importantly discovered that reverberation time was the result of a relationship between the area (geometry)\nand absorptive properties (materiality) of the surfaces of a room and its volume. Sabine acted as the acoustic consultant\non the design and construction of the Boston Symphony Hall, which was considered to be a great success.\nOne of the crucial things Sabine realized through his careful study of other concert halls was that reverberation time\nwas not the only criteria affecting the acoustics of a space: its room geometry and surface geometry were also\nimportant. The Musikverrein in Vienna is considered to be one the best concert halls in the world. Its excellent acoustics\nare thought to be the result of the low angle of its seats and the hard yet geometric complexity of its surfaces. This\ncomplexity is expressed at several scales—from the large balconies to the mid-scale windows, doorways, and statues\nto the small-scale carvings and moldings. Attitudes towards such complex surfaces changed with the architectural\nstyles after World War II. The advent of modernism championed the used of large, planar expanses of hard surfaces.\nThis geometric language and material palette is great for exploring formal compositions and properties. In response to\nModernist developments, and due to an increasing amount of noise-making technology, modern acoustic treatments\nwere invented (Thompson 2002). The application of these absorbing materials, such as carpets and ceiling panels,\nwas usually applied post-design, and this is largely the way in which architects design for acoustics today.\nFigure 1 3D prints of\nparametric acoustic\nsurfaces\n\nThis project seeks to connect architectural design with acoustic performance by taking advantage of new parametric\nand computational design techniques, and by utilizing digital fabrication to produce complex surfaces. Figure 1\nillustrates complex surfaces that regulate the acoustic character of a specific space. The use of digital fabrication to\nproduce complex surfaces that are acoustically regulating has been shown (Bonwetsch et al. 2008), and this paper\nwill not specifically address the creation of full-scale built prototypes but, rather, introduce the digital design tools and\ncommunication methods necessary to link to these technologies.\n\n2 Parametric Acoustic Tools\nAcoustic engineering principles establish relationships between room volume and room shape, surface geometry, material\nproperties, and acoustic performance (Cox 2009, Kuttruff 2000, Long 2006, Egan 2007). This knowledge can be captured\nin the form of parametric models and computer algorithms. In this project, these acoustic engineering principles were used\nto create computer programs that generate complex surfaces particularly suited to altering the acoustic performance of a\nspace. These parametric tools were written in Visual Basic and implemented in Microstation. Many different digital design\ntools were created. These tools generated different geometries to modulate different acoustic effects. The creation of user\ninterfaces allows the tools to be used by other non-specialist designers (fig. 2). This is important as many of these tools\nare designed for use in an architecture office.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n175\n\nParametric Acoustic Surfaces\nFigure 2 User interfaces\nfor developed for\nabsorbing and diffusing\nsurfaces\n\nThese digital tools create new complex forms that have particular acoustic qualities. Because these surfaces are assumed\nto have known material properties and are generated following specific rules, their acoustic performance can be predicted.\nHowever, the individual parametric tools do not currently consider the performance of the overall room in which the surface\nexists. In order to understand the acoustic properties of the room itself, these surfaces must be studied in acoustic analysis\nsoftware. In this study, the acoustic analysis software ODEON was used. Data transfer between software packages must\nbe considered. It is important that these digital tools generate triangulated polygons and that this geometry be grouped\naccording to material type. All of the parametric acoustic tools developed here return polygonal geometries that are suitable\nfor analysis, as well as a solid geometry that is suitable for rapid prototyping.\n\n3 Parametric Acoustic Surfaces\n3.1 Acoustic Absorbers and Resonators\nThe amount of absorption that a surface contributes to the overall room absorption is related to its material properties,\nits absorption coefficients measured in different frequency bands, and its surface area. The acoustic performance of a\nroom can be altered by changing the material properties of its surfaces. However, as acoustic absorption also depends\non surface area, by modifying the area of an absorbing surface, the reverberation time of a room can be altered.\nThe first parametric tool considered in this paper produces a geometry that is based on the foam wedges of the anechoic\nchamber, an extreme acoustic space with virtually no reverberation time. The tool produces triangular wedges whose\ngeometry can be altered in terms of the number of wedges, the angle of the wedges, and the angle of the side chamfer.\nThe angle of the wedges is important as this affects the number of times a sound strikes the surface before being retransmitted back into the room. The parametric acoustic tool developed here can either produce a particular percentage\nincrease in surface area or report this data back to the user. The parameters of angle, depth, and chamfer angle can be\nmodified. Many design solutions modify room acoustics through a change in material. Another design solution explored\nhere changes the acoustics of a space through a change in geometry. While the use of acoustic wedges in practice\n\nFigure 3\nFour acoustically\nregulating surfaces,\nclockwise from top left:\nan absorbing surface,\na diffusing surface,\na combination diffusing/\nabsorbing surface, and a\ncombination absorbing/\nreflecting surface\n\n176\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nParametric Acoustic Surfaces\nis often limited to extreme cases, this tool suggests a potential for greater control of acoustic absorption through the\nalteration of surface geometry. A complex surface that was generated using this tool is seen in figure 3.\nThere are generally thought to be three types of acoustic absorbers: porous absorbers, diaphragm absorbers, and\nvolume absorbers. In room acoustics, it does not make a difference by what method the sound energy is absorbed.\nThe absorbing capabilities of the porous absorber depends on the complex inner structure of the constituent material.\nThe other two absorbers are types of acoustic resonators. Acoustic resonators, either a resonating diaphragm or a\nresonating volume of air, are primarily used to absorb low frequency sounds. The relationship between the form of\nthe acoustic resonator and its acoustic performance has been well established (Kuttruff 2000). Further parametric\ntools have been developed that encode these relationships and generate the acoustic resonator geometries. These\ntools allow for the production of resonator geometries that can absorb sound energy in particular frequency bands. A\ncombination of different types of acoustic absorbers is often necessary to achieve the best sound absorption across\nall frequency bands.\n\n3.2 Acoustic Diffusers\nWhen sound is reflected from a surface, the reflected sound can be either redirected in a particular direction by large,\nflat surfaces or scattered in many directions by a complex surface. When a significant amount of the reflected sound is\ndispersed spatially and temporally, this is considered a diffuse reflection; and the complex surface that is providing the\nreflection, a diffuser (Cox 2009). It has been noted that adequate diffusion is critical for obtaining an even distribution\nof sound, and that diffusion can help absorptive materials be more effective by scattering sound so that it is more likely\nto encounter these surfaces. Acoustical defects such as flutter echo and irregularities in the slope of the reverberant\ndecay can develop in a room without adequate diffusing characteristics (Long 2006).\nRecently, there has been some very interesting research into new geometries of acoustic diffusers. However, a diffuser\ngeometry Manfred Schroeder discovered in the 1970s is the basis for many of the diffuser generating tools developed\nhere. The Schroeder diffuser is a one- or two-dimensional array of rectangular forms. The width of these diffusing\nelements is related to the frequency of sound that is desired to be diffused: the smaller the diffusing elements, the\nhigher the frequency of diffusion that occurs. While the depth of the diffusing element in its well appears to be randomly\ndetermined, it actually follows a particular mathematical sequence. The use of these mathematical formulae can add\nto the predictability of the sound diffusing characteristics of the geometry (Cox 2009). This is not to say that other\nmathematical sequences or geometric configurations of well depths cannot be used or will not produce better results.\nWhile diffusing surfaces are often designed with a rectangular form, it has been proposed that hexagonal forms can be\nused as well. Very complex forms, such as the more random configuration of rough natural stone, have also been used\nsuccessfully. Many different geometries will produce diffusion, though the extent to which they do should be verified\nby testing. The parametric acoustic tool developed here takes an array of polygonal shapes as input and generates a\ndiffusing surface. An example of a hexagonal diffusing surface is shown in figure 3.\n\nFigure 4\nThree diffusing surfaces:\na fractal triangular\npyramid, random well\ndepth diffuser, and a\nfractal random well\ndepth diffuser\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nFigure 4 demonstrates how the parametric acoustic diffuser tool can be used. Three types of diffuser panels are\nshown here: a fractal triangular pyramid, a random well-depth diffuser, and a fractal random well-depth diffuser.\nTriangles and pyramids can provide good diffusion and are often used in arrays. The scattering performance of\nthe triangle depends on its side angle. An angle of 40 degrees was determined to be appropriate and to provide\na good scattering of sound. The size of the triangular pyramids varies, and resultantly, this will scatter both the low\nand high frequency sounds differently. The layout and number of the triangular pyramids is determined by another\nparameter, the level of recursion. The second and third types of diffuser panels are based on the geometry of the\nSchroeder diffuser. They both have constant well width and random well depth. In the third option, the triangular\npanel is broken up into seven triangles along each side. Each of these triangles is then broken up again into seven\ntriangles. This fractal technique allows the geometry to diffuse multiple frequency ranges.\n\n177\n\nParametric Acoustic Surfaces\nThe parametric acoustic surfaces shown in figure 3 are comprised of geometric components that are\npopulated onto an underlying design surface. This creates a two-dimensional array of acoustically\nregulating components. This approach has proven its utility and adaptability, and the method of populating\ncomponents onto a surface is certainly not new (Peters 2007). However, it is not necessary to take this\napproach. Figure 5 shows a diffusing surface created from geometry generated by a circle-packing algorithm.\n\n3.3 Acoustic Reflectors\nAn acoustic reflector optimization\ntool was developed for the\ndesign of a triangulated roof for\na music pavilion in Copenhagen.\nThis student project was a\nstructure comprised of 230\npanels with 358 beams and 129\nnodes. One-third of the panels\nwere to be reflectors, one-third\nabsorbers, and the remainder,\ndiffuser panels. The first scheme\ncalled for a randomized selection\nof panels. Because of the large\nnumber of panels, this scheme\nproduced a degree of uniformity\nthroughout the space in terms\nof the absorption, reflection,\nand the diffusion of sound. To\ndecrease the sound level in the\nlounge area of the pavilion, an optimization tool was developed that determined panel types that would decrease\nthe sound reflection to particular audience positions. The basic algorithm is illustrated in figure 6. The first step was\nto define an initial selection of panels, a sound source location, and audience positions. In the second step, the\ncomputer program determined which panels could potentially provide good reflections. Hidden panels, or panels\nwith too slight of an angle of incidence were not considered. From this selection of panels, the program found\nwhich panels provided either direct reflections to the defined audience positions or almost direct reflections, within\na specified tolerance. From this information, one-third of the panels that provided good reflections to the audience\nwere selected to be reflectors. These panels are colored blue in step four. In order to choose the optimal absorbing\npanels for the lounge area, a similar strategy was used, except panels were defined to be absorbing panels instead\nof reflector panels. These panels are colored red in step six. This strategy, it was hoped, would provide the different\nacoustic characters to the audience zone and the lounge zone. After the reflector and absorber panels were defined\nthe rest of the panels became diffuser panels.\n\nFigure 5 Random\nradius, random depth\ncircle diffuser based\non circle packing\nalgorithm\n\nFigure 7 shows the ODEON acoustic analysis of the music pavilion schemes. This analysis shows a grid\nmeasurement of the audience and lounge zones. This comparison shows that for the optimized scheme there is 1)\nincreased sound levels and more even sound-level distribution in the audience area, and 2) decreased sound levels\nin the lounge area. The reduction in sound level was about 3 dB in the lounge area.\n\n3.4 Variable Acoustic Surfaces\nIt may be desirable for the acoustic and material properties of a surface to change or vary along the length of the\nsurface. The acoustic properties of a surface should be able to change their acoustic regulating characteristics\nas they traverse from room to room, or even within the same room. An acoustic absorbing surface turns into a\nreflecting surface, which again changes to a diffusing surface. In the example shown in figure 8, this parametric\nacoustic tool modifies the maximum depth of the well of the diffuser, controlled geometrically by a three-dimensional\ncontrol surface, so that the diffuser geometry can be seen to emerge from a smooth wall, a reflecting surface\nbecoming a sound-scattering device. There are many possibilities within this family of options for new forms of\narchitectural expression integrated with performance-driven form.\n\n178\n\nFigure 6 Steps taken\nusing the reflector\nselection optimization\nalgorithm\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nParametric Acoustic Surfaces\nFigure 7 Sound pressure\nlevel at 500 Hz for 1)\nrandom panel selection\nand 2) optimized panel\nselection options\n\n3.5 Combination Acoustic Surfaces\nJJW Architects’ PBS atrium project was a renovation that sought to cover a formerly open courtyard with a new roof\nenclosure (fig. 9). This covered space was to be filled with meeting rooms, breakout spaces, and a central presentation\narea. Similar techniques to those used in the design of the Smithsonian Courtyard Enclosure were used in the design of\nthis project (Peters 2007). A parametric model was developed to create the roof structure and the glazing components.\nThe number and size of glazing modules and the depth of the roof structure can be altered using the parametric\ntool. The depth of the roof structure is used to carry acoustic-absorbing material. A change in the depth of the roof\nstructure results in a change to the acoustic characteristics. The glazing components are faceted to provide sound\nscattering. Each glazing module is faceted with both glass and solid panels. The inclusion of the solid panels allows for\na greater amount of absorbing material to be placed into the roof structure. Also, the absorption of the roof structure\nis increased due to the fact that the efficiency of sound-absorbing material is affected by its distribution in a room. The\nspaced absorbing material absorbs more sound energy than is accounted for by its area (Egan 2007). The geometry\nresponds to other design criteria beyond acoustic performance. The glazing components are oriented towards the\nnorth, providing even, indirect light and protecting the atrium from much direct sunlight.\nFigure 8 Variable\nacoustic-diffusing\nsurface.\n\nConclusions\nThrough the use of parametric modeling and computer programming techniques, acoustic performance can be\nintegrated into architectural design. Many of the relationships between acoustic performance and room geometry and\nmaterial are now understood, and these can be built into our digital design environment. With these new parametric\nacoustic tools, designers can generate new acoustically regulating surfaces that have a predictable acoustic\nperformance. This can allow complicated acoustic performance criteria to be used creatively in the architectural design\nprocess. The actual introduction of these tools and concepts into an architectural office remains to be tested.\nThe absorption characteristics of a surface can be established using the parametric acoustic tools developed in this project.\nUsing acoustic analysis software, the acoustic performance of a room can be tested in relation to its geometry, absorption,\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n179\n\nParametric Acoustic Surfaces\n\nand diffusion properties. However, it is difficult to predict the diffusing characteristics of the particular geometries created\nusing these parametric tools. While computational methods for the prediction of diffusion characteristics do exist, such as\nboundary element methods, these have not yet been implemented or tested in relation to the generation of these surfaces.\n\nFigure 9\nPBS Atrium project by\nJJW Architects\n\nThe calculation of acoustic performance necessitates the need for material absorption properties. This information needs to\nbe attached to geometric entities in the CAD model. This modeling of information should extend beyond the characteristics\nof single elements. There is a need for geometric elements to be grouped and for adjacent information to be understood.\nThis information would then allow for the prediction of the performance not only of a surface, but of the entire room as well.\nThese acoustically performance-driven surfaces are potentially quite complex structures. While it has been shown that\nproduction information for complex surfaces can be accomplished with CAD systems, the manufacture of these surfaces\nremains to be tested.\nIt is a relatively simple matter to integrate the CAD design process with ODEON software. The transfer of the 3D model\nfrom one system to the other is problem free as long as the data requirements of the analysis software are understood:\ntriangulated geometry, “watertight” geometry, dxf file format, and level separated by material. While the analysis software is\neasy to use, it is difficult to customize. It would be useful to be able to directly access the calculation routines of the analysis\nsoftware to be able to integrate this within the designer’s CAD package. With this capability, new plug-ins could be created\nthat would allow for the creation of exciting new performance-driven architectures.\nThe author would like to thank the RealDania foundation, Claus Moller Petersen and Carlbro/Grontmij Acoustic Engineering,\nDr. Cheol-Ho Jeong of the Danish Technical University, and JJW Architecture for their support of this research project.\n\n180\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nParametric Acoustic Surfaces\n\nReferences\nBlesser, Barry and Linda-Ruth Salter.

These mechanisms contribute to\nthe increased efficiency of production, expanding the ability of both manufacturers and production engineers to\ncreate a workplace with smoother supply-chain management, as well as economies of scale and scope that are\ncontingent on increased capitalism in a networked, globalized world. Since the introduction of assembly lines for\nmass production in the early twentieth century, the flexibility of economic services and accumulation, as David Harvey\nidentifies, has increased the need for flexibility in spaces of production as well (Harvey 1990). Flexible accumulation\nin transient economic times such as today must follow when the new globalized economy is constantly in flux and\nautomation and control are essential. Mobility and flexibility are both physical and philosophical imperatives, aided by\nnew small-scaled controls such as handheld wireless devices, which also contribute to a rising culture of nomadism.\nThe shrinking scale of technologies and facilities has provided the mobile worker with numerous opportunities within\ncomplexly networked systems, forming a new paradigm for urban production spaces of the future. Both centralized\nproduction management and financial power that agglomerated in the 1980s in key cities as described by Saskia\nSassen (Saskia Sassen, 1991)3 are now transforming. The potentials for a decentralized work force and for places\nof production that will invigorate not only a new economic web but also local places, where objects can be made in\nclustered urban networks, are increasing.\n\n1 Mass Production\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, Colt, in\nHartford, and Whitney, in New Haven,\ndeveloped mechanized production for\nassembling uniform parts for rifles with\nstationary machine tools. These techniques\nwere followed to assemble interchangeable\nparts for the mechanization of clocks, sewing\nmachines, and bicycle production, among\nother products, allowing components to be\nchanged out easily and replaced for repair\nor design adjustment, without reconfiguring\nthe entire product (Hounshell 1984). This\nbecame known as the American System of\nManufactures and was adopted worldwide.\nIn this method, while workers assembled\neach product individually at stationary\ntables, the elements themselves were massproduced (fig. 1. printing plant photograph\nby Ezra Stoller). With electricity supplied from\n\n186\n\nFigure 1 Printing Plant,\nClarksville, TN, 1949,\nphotograph by Ezra\nStoller, courtesy Esto\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nReal Time / Implication for Production Spaces\na local source, such as water, the integrated building was a machine, and the factory floor became a jungle of belts,\nwheels, and bands (Biggs 1996). The floor layouts were rigid and inflexible. The machines defined the workplaces,\nsuch that workers often did not move their full bodies; thus, their repetitive hand and arm motions led to fatigue and,\neventually, injury. In this system of manufacturing, humans served literally as the motors (Rabinbach, 1994). Floor\nengineers and supervisors directly controlled production in using Taylor’s method of Scientific Management, which he\ndeveloped in 1912. Henry Ford used this method, in combination with Frank and Lillian Gilbreth’s motion studies, which\nwere developed to enhance production speed and efficiency, on his assembly lines.\nA corporation’s goal of product choice—driven both by manufacturer inventiveness and consumer desire for ever-new\ncommodities—came solidly to the forefront in the early twentieth century. However, choice remained limited at the time:\nthe Ford Model-T automobile was black—and only black—and available in one design. In the 1913 Ford Highland Park\nIllinois factory, each element was produced separately and assembled step by step in a vertical chain of production,\nwith fixed tooling at fixed locations. The Ford factory operation was multi-level, with the car parts delivered to the top\nfloors (fig. 2: Ford Motor Company).\nFigure 2 Ford Motor\nCompany, Highland\nPark, IL, Albert Kahn\nArchitect, 1913\n\nAs the automobile was assembled, gravity helped it down each production level to the ground floor for completion.\nGradually, production methods evolved, allowing for the simultaneous assembly of different designs so that two or three\ntypes of cars could be made on one production line in just a few days. Any change to the car design would require a\nretooled production line, stopping production. By 2003, computer mechanization had increased the possibilities for\nmass customization to such a degree that the Lansing Michigan GM plant was able to produce one car in just less\nthan seventeen hours (Weber 2002). The plant was also touted as being able to change out the type of car made on\nthat production line, as needed, with each new inventive improvement. While GM dreamed of an exponential, nearly\nlimitless increase in production capability, it never used the potential flexibility, and we are now seeing the ramifications\nof that product design and innovation stagnation.\n\n2 Just In Time\nAutomated production made a huge leap when the computer harnessed new systems to meet the urgent demands\nof the military industrial complex in World War II. Additionally, manufacturing methods were enhanced with concepts\ndeveloped by the Toyota Motor Company team called, Just-In-Time production, which used the Kaizen system of\nteamwork to encourage social interaction, employee responsibility, and creativity in the production line. Toyota also\nemphasized not having waste or overstocked goods in their warehouses. Although Toyota perfected the Kaizen method,\nW. Edwards Deming, an American statistician who had studied with Walter Shewhart, the inventor of Total Quality\nManagement, developed the philosophy and system. Deming, who had assisted manufacturers in the war, taught\nJapanese scientists quality-control methods in the 1950s. Toyota embraced his concepts in developing electronic\noverhead digital signboards, called Andon Boards, which are used in the factory to track the production process\nand gauge the production status (May 2007). This feedback loop signals differences between such manufacturing\nconcerns as scheduled production and actual timing, missing items, downtime on a production process, or the timing\nimpact of a robot.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n187\n\nReal Time / Implication for Production Spaces\nUsing this information, employees can self-regulate, relieving production bottlenecks to maintain continuous assembly.\nWhile the signaling boards might produce anxiety and pressure for the workers at first, they also relieve those effects\n(fig. 3. Andon board in factory). As workers look to the board, they see problem areas before the machines malfunction\nor before they miss parts along the line, and workers act more effectively as a team through a collaborative process.\nIn the design of factories, the development of common entrances for workers and managers and shared break areas,\nand the placement of R&D near production teams and workstations adjacent to the production floor, further enhanced\nteamwork and inspired interaction between white and blue-collar workers.\nFigure 3 Andon\nboard in factory\n\nWhen factory automation and distribution networks replaced the worker, the touch of a button controlled production\nrather than skilled workers completing multiple tasks. Cultural critics such as Lewis Mumford praised the new technology\nbut derided its lack of humanism (Mumford 1964). By the 1970s, older equipment was upgraded in a piecemeal\nway, with the attachment of computer controls and CNC machines, until the mechanizations subsumed them entirely\nand shop equipment was fully replaced by embedded digital controls. In many factories, workers sat fixed at one\nstation, operating machines via computer programs and wired systems, bored from the repetitive activity and, thus,\nless productive because they didn’t have a connection to what they were making (fig. 4: CBS factory Long Island City).\n\nFigure 4 CBS/Columbia\nRecords factory, Long\nIsland City, 1953,\nphotograph by Ezra\nStoller, courtesy Esto\n\n188\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nReal Time / Implication for Production Spaces\n3 Consumer Logistics\nThe logistics and goods distribution for globalized manufacturing became a sub-specialization in the 1960s as well.\nSince the ultimate goal in an increasingly globalized economy was to reach the consumer, integrating the feedback\nloop between supply and demand into a combined factory/warehouse/retail outlet was essential. Spatially, this meant\nthat central places of control were networked into a broader decentralized economy, where physical distance no longer\nmattered and objects moved fluidly.\nFigure 5\nToyota City, Japan\n\nCompanies from Benetton apparel to Zara, Nike, and BMW embraced the new ease at mass customization and\nconsumer feedback, subcontracting production to an outsourced network of nearby and more distant manufacturers\nto reduce their operating costs with cheaper labor and less overhead costs, taking advantage of a locale’s labor\nspecialization. Toyota outsourced its manufacturing to local companies, which eventually developed into a complete\nnetworked city for Toyota manufacturing known as Toyota City (fig. 5: Toyota City).\nThe consumer gained control as a “prosumer” (Toffler 1980) in Benetton’s 6000 franchise stores, which have an\nElectronic Data Interchange feedback mechanism that notifies the warehouse managers to restock shelves when\nsales of various items increase. Information about the product, embedded in bar codes, is transmitted via computer\nto the factory, where they increase the production of the most popular items. Production remains flexible, as sweaters\nof one style can be made all in white and then dyed according to demand. Hidden fiber-optic cable networks guide\nthe manufacturing of 7,500 items a day. Spatially, these production methods influenced architect Tobias Scarpa. For\nhis 1995 factory design in Treviso, he placed a central roadway spine between two production spaces to increase\ncirculation flow and to provide more places for truck logistics, such as moving goods out. He also constructed a 170 x\n80 meter automated distribution warehouse, thus, emphasizing distribution and marketing over making things.\nTo increase product tracking and market placement, Benetton and others such as Wal-Mart, Levi-Strauss, and Zara\nare switching from the use of bar codes to “smart shelf” technology. The Auto-ID tracking system, also used for locating\nitems in shipping containers, palettes, and warehouses, has Radio Frequency Identification Tags, developed at MIT’s\nAuto ID Center, that track inventory, location, and manufacturing needs in real time. This allows retailers to precisely\nrecord information so that they do not have to physically monitor store shelves, and the data is transferred automatically\nto the factory managers. A virtual umbilical cord links production and sales, factories and stores. Zara, which also\nfocuses on flexibility and instantaneous development of new products, also has an in-house design team charged with\nthe task of producing new styles monthly. This encourages customers to return and shop often for the latest goods.\nThe digital communication between the design and the production branches of the company are monitored in a fluid\ndistribution system, partially guided by a chain of command in real time that begins with the consumer in a controlled\nsuper organism (Kelly 1994).\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n189\n\nReal Time / Implication for Production Spaces\n4 Wireless Spatial Management\nSuch interconnectedness, both virtual and physical, coalesces in the reinvented twenty-first century factory. Here,\nautomation furthers lean manufacturing efficiency and just-in-time production at every scale—from worker to worker,\nworker to robot, product to manufacturer, worker to the world—through the advent of smart handheld machines that\nare run as wireless installations, impacting worker activity and the organization of production spaces. (Zdnet.co.uk\n2003). In the digitally automated factory, the spaces housing the technologies have been increasingly foregrounded\nover those housing employees. In clean rooms, for example, workers in their “bunny suits” fit in between the spaces for\nthe processing of computer chips. Industrial engineers organize these spaces without architects, and with little focus\non the worker who is the intelligent operator of the machine. More recently, to ease worker alienation, organizational\nmanagement gurus have devised spatial systems to guide factory planning that diverge from the linearity of the Fordist\nplant where goods were processed in a singular line. Instead, raw materials can enter the production process at various\npoints with the use of interchangeable modules for expansion and contraction. Companies such as BMW, which is now\nexpanding their plants in Spartensburg, North Carolina, and Leipzig, Germany, use this system. Further experiments\nin factory layouts include combined R&D areas, “solar system” layouts, “main street” spines for increased personnel\ninteraction, the “fractal,” housing the management near the workers, centralizing break areas, developing communal\nentries for both workers and management, and an alphabet-soup-shaped layout where workers are being called\n“partners” and “team players” rather than “worker.”\nNew factory designs have had to adapt to the shrinking scales of tabletop robotics and handheld computers, forming\nan operational and spatial shift in production spaces towards dynamic networked and interactive flexible spaces.\nSince the computer often directs the workflow, it is logical that the factory would adopt the network organization of the\ninternal workings of the computer itself. This is similar to Paul Baran’s analysis for the Rand Corporation (Baran 1964),\nwhere, rather than emphasizing a hierarchical system, he recommended distributed networks that extend branches of\ncommunication that can overlap, retract, or spread out further (fig. 6. Models of Organization Rand Corporation, 1964).\nFigure 6 Models of\nOrganization Rand\nCorporation, 1964\n\n5 Mobile Distributed Networks\nWith the use of remote controls for mobile workers in production plants that are controlled from a head office, but with\nnumerous workers running the decentralized and distributed networks: This is seen not only as a physical manifestation\nof the worker-to-supervisor relationship, and team-to-team communication, but also as affecting the worker’s increased\nmobility and training. The complexity of the networked distributed system guides the computer modeling of automation\naccordingly, which includes quality control, the worker’s ability, and the consumer response. What workers give up in\nhands-on craft and machine tooling, they gain in managerial or supervisory experience (fig. 7. distributed networks).\nThe reorganization of production spaces because of handhelds also parallels the workflow of organizational network\nintegration, defined by Luther P. Gerlach. Gerlach is an organization sociologist who classified three attributes of networks\nin social and nonprofit organizations as segmentation, polycentrism, or integration, “where there are real-time adjustments\nfor continually changing circumstances across potentially expanding fields of operation” (Gerlach 1965).\n\n190\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nReal Time / Implication for Production Spaces\nFigure 7 Distributed\nnetworks, Rand\nCorporation, 1964\n\nThese real-time fluctuations are similar to manufacturing networks for mass customization and new manufacturing\nmethods, as they constantly change with new desires.\n\n6 Handhelds Within the Factory\nWith the shrinking of controls, high-powered handhelds, communication between departments, and to-and-from\nrobots on a factory floor for scheduling, maintenance, and inventory: Workers can track repairs and work on machinery\nremotely, which can enhance the productivity of the mobile worker and increase flexibility of divisions of labor and their\nspecific location on the factory floor. Numerous computer hardware and software companies such as Cisco, SAP,\nAccenture, and Oracle have all created systems that run programs for handheld PCs. Logistics companies such as\nUPS and FedEx now use handheld PCs to run their physical distribution networks, and transfer that knowledge as\nconsultants for internal business management and production spaces (fig. 8. handheld PCs).\nFor example, SAP’s programs for mobile production allow employees to view work instructions on their handhelds\nin the factory and, with bar code scanners, to check and control production processes through embedded chips,\nresulting in synchronous communication systems for real-time inventory, production control, and warehousing. Others,\nsuch as Intel, designed network processors with Rockwell Automation, as part of a line of high-performance tools that\nprovide manufacturers with seamless information flow between factory floor and the R&D offices, wherever they may\nbe outsourced. The food and beverage industry has taken advantage of the wireless PDAs for their quality control,\npalletization, gauging consistency and sizing of the food item, temperature control, and robotic arm movement in\nloading and packing food products.\n\nFigure 8 Handheld PCs\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nWhen various components of a product, such as a car, need to be changed—just as in interchangeable parts\nmanufacturing of the nineteenth century—computer-controlled robots can perform the job, directed by workers\nwith handheld PCs. Robots displayed on the screen move components from storage areas, directed via a wireless\nsystem. The production process is programmed into the computer\nand tested in simulations until it is perfected. Once operational,\nany errors or bottlenecks are digitally reported in real time, and\nthe process can be instantly adjusted. Rather than the large-scale\nAndon board that is visible to all, each worker can negotiate the\nissues on their individual small screen. Teamwork continues but\nat the level of virtual communications; there is less face-to-face\ntime, but workers are able to move freely to achieve the production\ngoals. Another system now under development, with assistance\nfrom the European Commission and a consortium of groups through\nthe Fraunhofer Institute in Germany, is an Intelligent Networked\nManufacturing System (IN-MANUS) that makes further use of wireless\nand smart controls, networking people, machines, and robots for smart\nproduction with sensors and cameras embedded in the equipment. In this process, computers do not get reprogrammed\nwith each change in a design, but, rather, the new information input into the system fluidly adapts the Smart Connected\nControl Platforms. Mobile controls and headsets for workers also enhance communication, because the information on\n\n191\n\nReal Time / Implication for Production Spaces\nthe changes appears simultaneously on the handheld PCs and the workers are then able to discuss the changes. These\ndevices allow factory managers to move freely and mistakes to be fixed with increased speed. Currently, Fiat factories in\nItaly are testing this (Fraunhofer, 2009).  In the most extreme scenario, the factory can run automatically as does a power\nplant, or remotely by robotic control as the 1923, then futuristic, Karel Capek’s play RUR (fig 9. digital robot Fraunhofer\nInstitute).\nThe scene is like a puppeteer controlling the actions of the puppets, with a virtual string attached to each movable\nelement, controlled from a central hub. This information flow allows instant decision making, which improves productivity,\nflexibility, and, ultimately, profitability. Corporations can have their front office and knowledge centers in major cities and\ntake advantage of dispersed labor, throughout the city or in nearby areas, as in the case with Hong Kong and China.\n\n7 Automated Urban Industries\nUrbanistically, the automated mobile industry technologies can affect spatial configurations at the scale of the city,\nfocusing on not only the globalization of industry between distant locations (Friedman 2008), but also a foreseeable\npotential for increased industrial urbanization that takes advantage of proximity and clustering across a city. The\nfactories of the industrial revolution, which grew by accretion, might be revitalized in vertical urban settings, with a\npotential for smaller production, linked by virtual connections, and with more flexible investments and manufacturing.\nImagine automated digital controls that formalize links between urban, cottage-type industries with tabletop robotic,\ncomputer-aided manufacturing and urban districts, making the mega-scale, horizontal suburban factory with the allunder-one-roof, obsolete. Small companies could print out their products from CNC controlled stereolithography and\nrapid prototyping at desktops. Rather than congealing into major corporations, they could splinter as networks of local\nmanufacturers at a smaller scale. The automation of plants in rural areas of Norway proposed by industrialist O. Bjorke\nin 1979 to help with employment, serves as an example of cellular production in mini factories. Bjorke conceived of\ndecentralizing automated plants similar to the Methodology for Unmanned Manufacturing, which was developed in\n1972 in Japan (Merchant 1983). In the 1980s, the networks of companies in the Bologna region of Italy, Benetton’s\noutsourced plants, or those of factory towns developed because their close proximity made it possible for them to\nshare energy resources.\nWhen industry in former Western city centers become automated, existing industrial buildings have the potential to be\nnetworked together to capitalize on the local production expertise. For example, the Garment District in New York City\ncould be reborn, modeled on its former organization, just slightly more advanced than its automation age in virtually\nlinked clusters. To expand upon this scenario: A designer in her office could complete a fashion concept and send the\ndrawing digitally to the pattern maker. The pattern maker is linked to the sample fabricator, who transfers the files to the\ndetail embroider. The detail embroider checks it, and then, finally, sends it to the main plant for production. Production\nis controlled via PDAs by the head office, which is communicating with the machine operators, who are also on their\nhandhelds—all within five blocks of each other.\nLocal industries, flexible and versatile in what they make, could be formed to supply those adjacent communities\nthat are networked from a centralized corporate office, decreasing production costs by eliminating distance shipping\nand storage, as some products would be made just in time for the local population. The idea of clustering enhances\nthe new concepts in industrial symbiosis, where each element in the production is recycled into the next, and the\n“wasted” energy powers the town. Informal hidden cottage industries could become smaller and recognized as formal\neconomies, as in Dharavi, Mumbai, or Queens, New York (Sassen 1991), where the seemingly informal economy\nis highly structured, but they could also be integrated into the urban fabric, eliminating the segregation of uses as\ndetermined by zoning the hybrid city. The scale of the multinational corporation could be reduced, showing a return to\nideas of “small is beautiful” or a smallness within bigness (E.F. Schmaucher 1973) through mass customization, small\nbatch work on flexible production systems, and finding the most productive rather than the cheapest laborers, who can\nbe reeducated for each new manufacturing iteration.\nThe future smart factory, wherein mobile workers with PDAs are virtually connected to the production machines, moves\nbeyond the modern assembly line and into the realm of organically integrated real-time processing, in a new networked\nspatial economy rather than an isolated heterotopia. This ubiquitous culture of making, thus, becomes part of the\neveryday urban experience.\n\n192\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nReal Time / Implication for Production Spaces\nCitations\nNorbert Weiner.

The goal of the project was to learn from traditional building techniques and\nto translate the cultural knowledge about performance requirements such as constructive weather protection and\nstructure for today’s tools and digital design systems.\n\n1 Introduction\nMaterial and production processes that inform design have come to interest architects over recent years (Kolarevic\n2003). But still, geometry is at the core of today’s digital design representation within standard software tools (Kilian\n2006). Geometry alone makes it hard to capture the complex relationships among material properties, the constructive\nlogic of building elements, and production. Current building scale digital fabrication technologies enable architects\nto integrate these often contradicting requirements through the direct link between code and fabrication, which not\n\n194\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nCultural Performance in Robotic Timber Construction\nonly yields new possibilities for the design, but also requires revising the usual top-down plan to the construction\napproach. In order to set up a link among design, fabrication processes, and material, the architect needs to control\nand manipulate his tools on the hardware side, as well as on the software side. This can be done through custom\nscripts, which, on the one hand, allow for the control of tailor-made hardware tools, and, on the other hand, integrate\ndesign-related parameters with process and material-driven properties.\nFor this research project, we were looking into component-based, flexible materials that can be processed into different\nshapes and lengths, and that are suitable for outdoor application. The material should be rooted in traditional artisanship\nin order to analyze culturally developed ways of construction and to test their relevance for today’s digitally driven\nprocesses. For these reasons, wood was chosen as the preferred building material. Further, wood is inexpensive, and\ndepending on the type of wood and how it is applied, it possesses great durability and strength compared to its weight.\nAfter all, it is a sustainable material that is easily available on the local market.\n\n2 Hardware: Material and Fabrication\nThe object of investigation was the design of load-bearing, waterproof timber walls that integrate an opening (fig. 1).\nThe walls needed to allow for insulation and were produced through an additive digital fabrication process. Wood\nwas used for most of the constituent parts of the wall, such as the load-bearing structure and the exterior and interior\ncladding. The analysis of traditional wood construction such as carcass buildings or overlapping techniques for wood\npreservation found in vernacular farmhouses in the Swiss Alps informed the design systems used to organize the\nsingular slats to form a wall.\n\n2.1 Material Specifications\nThe projects presented here utilized standard spruce slats that are widely used, with a diameter of 4 cm by 60 cm.\nThe length of the slats was allowed to vary between 15 cm and 120 cm [place all in mm or cm]. Besides the type of\nwood selected, constructive weatherproofing played an important role in the durability of wooden building elements\n(Schweizerische-Normen-Vereinigung 2007). These requirements led to the following guidelines: Face wood should not\npoint in an upward direction due to its sensitivity regarding water absorption. Areas where rain water could accumulate\nwere to be avoided, and an overall good drainage system should be achieved. These guidelines provided protection\nagainst fungus infestation and fissuring.\n\n2.2 Fabrication Process\nThe fabrication tool we used was a six-axis industrial robot equipped with a custom gripper for handling and placing\nthe slats at the right position in space with a specified angle (fig. 2). The robot arm can operate a workspace of 3\nby 3 by 8 m.\n\nFigure 2 Industrial\nSix-Axis Robot\n\nFigure 3 Custom Air\nSuction Gripper\n\nThe custom gripper we developed was equipped with air suction nozzles, which grab the wood slat from the side\n(fig. 3). The nozzles could be switched on and off individually via the robots control unit.\nIn addition to the placement tool, we used a circular saw to cut the wood slats to length. Since every slat can\ncontinuously vary from 15 cm to 120 cm, the robot was used to show the length of the slat for cutting. The\ncutting angles of the slats can be adjusted from -45 degrees up to +45 degrees. For exact angle cutting, the saw\nwas connected to an automatic “turning table,” which uses the same controller as the robot itself. This forms the\nseventh axis of the system. In this stage of the project, the cutting procedure had been kept semi-automatic, as this\nprocedure can be handed over to a standard industrial trimming machine in later stages of automation.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n195\n\nCultural Performance in Robotic Timber Construction\nThe connections between the slats were made through nailing on a per layer basis. The horizontal build-up process\nresults in walls with the slats and their grain in a specific direction. The alignment of the grain is directly linked to the\nstructural and weatherproofing performance of wood structures. A horizontal bricklike placement of slats is ideal for\nthe fabrication process, but it is not suitable for the outdoor application of a wall. Horizontal slats would allow water to\naccumulate, and the vertical nailing is susceptible to horizontal wind loads due to pulling forces inside the structure.\nFrom this, it follows that for optimized water drainage and structural results, the walls should be turned over by an\nangle of 90 degrees after production (fig. 4).\nFigure 4 Smooth\nSurface Ideal for Water\nDrainage in Wood\nGrain Direction\n\nThe stacking process and the nailed connections set the following constraints for the design:\n• A minimum required overlap of half the slat’s width between the slats of one layer to the slats of the next layer to\nallow for proper nailing connections.\n• A maximum allowed cantilever of approximately 70 cm for the overall structure during production in order to avoid\nsagging and deformation.\n• Placement logic for the slats either predefined or through optimization to prevent collisions between the gripper\nand the already built wall.\n• An end angle that adheres to the +-45 degree limit of the cutting machine to ensure closed flush placement of\nwood slats.\n\n3 Software technologies\nFor the design and development environment, we chose a standard modeling and animation software package due\nto its integration of the Python (Python-Software-Foundation 2009) programming language and the flexible grouping\nmechanism for geometry. Additional technologies used were the Python vector library “Euclid” (Holkner 2009) for\nvector and matrix calculations and the “General Polygon Clipping” library, with the Python binding from Joerg Raedler\nfor 2D polygon Boolean operations (Raedler 2009).\n\n4 Software: Design tools and Export\nDesign and construction parameters derived from physical testing should inform the data within the 3D modeling\napplication. But the tools available within standard CAD packages did not allow for a flexible integration of this data.\nTherefore we developed a design setup that consisted of four parts. The first one was a set of design scripting tools\nwritten in Python which generate slats inside the 3D environment. The second part was a predefined data structure\ninside the 3D application. The third part was a custom export from the digital model to the robot, written in Python as\nwell. It generates the fourth part the KRL code (Kuka Robot Language) which controls the fabrication robot.\n\n196\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nCultural Performance in Robotic Timber Construction\n4.1 Design scripting tools\nThe design tools were comprised of several scripting functions that can be used to generate slats. They simplified\nthe control over parameters such as location, rotation, and cut angles. Furthermore, they integrated production and\nconstruction logics derived from physical testing into the 3D environment by setting constraints for the generation of\nslats (e.g., the custom slat function did not allow for the generation of slats with a cut angle greater than the degree limit\npredetermined by the fabrication process).\n\n4.2 Data structure\nThe data structure inside the 3D modeling application provides the basis for manual interaction during the design\nscripting process. From experience during previous research projects, we learned that about 90 percent of the design\ngoals can easily be reached through direct programming, but around 10 percent are more easily solved through\nmanual interaction. The data structure builds the interface between the scripting part of the work and the manual\nchanges required.\nThe predefined hierarchical grouping logic within the 3D design package corresponded to the production logic of\nstacking. The top-level group formed the whole production piece and contained further subgroupings, which formed\nthe layers. These layer groups held the actual slat components. In addition to geometric information, such as size,\nposition in space, and cut angles, fabrication details were attached to the 3D slat objects. This information and the\ngrouping sequence could be analyzed by scripts that already provided feedback about the production process in the\n3D application. The designer could then modify the model and integrate necessary changes in an interactive process\nthat did not stop after the generating script had finished.\n\n4.3 Export\nThe export optimized the design data structure for production and generated the machining code for the robot. The\ncustom export functionality latched into the grouping hierarchy inside the 3D environment to extract layer data and\nto read out the location, rotation, and angle data from the slat components.\nThe ordering of the layers and of the components within the layers determined the basic placement sequence for\nproduction. Two critical aspects had to be solved during export for production. First, due to the shape of the gripper,\nwhich was predetermined by the picking of slat from the saw, virtual collision testing had to be performed to avoid\ncollisions between the gripper and the already placed slats. Depending on the result of the collision test, the gripping\nposition had to be modified until the algorithm found a solution. Second, in order for the walls to form a closed volume\nfor insulation, the wood slat’s face had to be placed flush, touching the other slats (figs. 5, 6).\nDue to tolerances from cutting that could reach up to 1 cm, a final vertical move of the gripper could not serve to place the\nslats since, in some cases, this led to collisions. This fact required that we move the robot’s gripper, a complex process\nwhose placement was dependent on the already placed slats’ orientation, the cut angle, and the orientation of the slat it was\npreparing to place. The Python code transferred this information via modified function calls to KRL.\n\n5 Case Studies\n\nFigure 5 Flush\nPlacement\nSection\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nFigure 6 Flush\nplacement section\n\nThe following case studies present\nsome of the results developed\nand fabricated during a onemonth student research course.\nThe goal of the course was to\ndevelop a full-scale lintel and sill\nsystem, which would form the\nbasic design for a wall prototype 4\nm wide by 2.5 m high and with an\napproximate thickness of 30–60\ncm. The intention was to have the\nprototypes serve as the building\nenvelope and, therefore, had to\nallow for the addition of insulation\nin between two outer wooden\nshells. Further\nperformance\nrequirements were the structural\nfeasibility of the design proposal\nand weather protection, either\nconstructive or technical.\n\n197\n\nCultural Performance in Robotic Timber Construction\nWe asked the students to analyze traditional wood building techniques and to evaluate their potential for fulfilling the\naforementioned performance requirements. They specifically analyzed systems that would allow for the integration of\nopenings or that already integrated an opening, with a special focus on constructive weather protection, insulation,\nor structure. In a second step, the students translated and adapted the artisan methods to today’s requirements and\nto the digital fabrication process at hand.\nThe first case study reinterprets the traditional carcass system (fig. 7). The most important aspect of the carcass is\nthat it integrates the opening in the structural system itself—no additional structural parts are required. The opening\nemerges naturally from the system. Another important characteristic is that the carcass can be built with relatively\nshort wooden beams. Both of these facts translate very well to the production process, which works with short\npieces of wood to form larger building elements with openings. The sill and lintel of this design form the basis for the\nstructural system, which consists of large beams running through the whole piece (fig 8). Since many small pieces\nform the large beams, the beams are able to interlock easily with the reinforcing slats. The traditional filling material in\nbetween the beams of vernacular carcass buildings consisted of adobe and straw. The drawback of this technique\nis poor insulation performance due to air permeability. Thus, the students replaced the filling with a translucent ETFE\nshrink-wrap foil (fig 9). The small chambers between the wooden structure and the foil limit air circulation, enhancing\nthe insulation effect.\nThe second case study uses the cantilevers in traditional Wallis sheds (fig. 10) as a basis for its design system. The\ngradual increase in width of the overhang is a simple means to achieve weather protection and to drain rainwater\naway from the structure. The students reasoned that the fabrication of small modular components that overlap and\ninterlock with each other could solve the limitation of the slats’ length. The slats can be assembled into one structure\nto build up the wall (fig. 11). By tilting the upper part of the component, the water drips from the tip of the horizontal\nslats. The inside of the components can be filled with cellulose-flake insulation. An opening can be integrated easily\ninto the wall by leaving out select, individual modules (fig. 12).\n\nFigure 7 Carcass\n\nFigure 8 Wrapped Carcass\n\nFigure 9 Detail\n\n6 Discussion\nBetween the material potential and the performance of a building component exists a direct relation that is influenced\nby the techniques and technologies used for production and assembly. In digital fabrication, the fabrication process\ndata controls the transgression of a material component (slat) to a building component (wall). The selection of small\ncomponents and a flexible connection technique (nailing) allows for the production of intelligent, monolithic elements.\nIf we interpret the state of the feedstock as a system of high entropy, then the production process enriches the\nmaterial with information that leads to a material aggregation that is functional, and whose design potential surpasses\nthe possibilities of the singular small piece. The performance conceived during the design process can emerge only\nthrough the inseparable ensemble of the components as a whole building part.\n\n198\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nCultural Performance in Robotic Timber Construction\nIn traditional trades, the data that informed the building part was the knowledge about construction accumulated and\npassed on through generations of craftspeople. With the rise of the timber engineering industry, it became common\npractice to fabricate complex elements from larger boards of wooden composites.\n\nFigure 10 Traditional Shed\n\nFigure 11 Section\nOverhang Structure\n\nFigure 12 Elevation\nOverhang Structure\n\nThe performance of such elements is often defined through the performance of the composites in use and less through\nhow the original material is applied. Material properties of wood such as grain direction, shrinkage, or the sensivity of\nface wood to moisture are, rather, interpreted as problems and are mostly solved on the material engineering level. In\ncontrast to fabrication processes for derived timber products, the prototypical techniques laid out in this paper provide\nthe possibility to work with raw wood. This requires responding to material properties and to the projected performance\nrequirements. Together with the production process, this can enable a new freedom of design that generates an\nintrinsic expression that emanates from the interplay of the aforementioned physical and expressive facets of building.\nThe characteristics of the wood are not ignored but integrated as the driver of the project from the beginning. This\nresearch tightly integrates material and technique, which bears similarity to pre-industrialization artisanship. Due to\nthis affinity, the analysis of traditional construction systems is a rewarding starting point for the development of design\nsystems for today’s digital fabrication processes. Similar to the artisan who had to master his tools, the architect needs\nto master his software, as well as hardware, and to understand their relation to matter.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n199\n\nCultural Performance in Robotic Timber Construction\nConclusion\nThe research shows that it can be useful not to discard the cultural performance visible in traditional construction methods\nbut to analyze and abstract these often sophisticated yet simple solutions for use with the tools of today. Until now, the\nfocus was on very primitive constructive systems that could be easily analyzed and appropriated for a digital fabrication\nprocess. In a next step, there could be an evaluation of more complex systems that integrate different materials for specific\nparts of construction and for new types of connections.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank Ralph Bärtschi and Michael Lyrenmann for their invaluable support with the\nfabrication process; furthermore, Tobias Bonwetsch for his advice and proofreading, and Prof. Fabio Gramazio and\nProf. Matthias Kohler for their trust in my work.

This innovation can often be related to advances\nin construction techniques or design tools. This paper focuses on the development of a digital design environment\nfor a new manufacturing process that can produce large architectural components. The design environment can be\ncustomized so that it incorporates both the flexibility and the constraints of the construction technology, such that the\ncomponents produced maximize the core concept of the technology.\n\n1 Introduction\nRapid Prototyping is a mature technology that has been around for 25 years in the manufacturing and product\ndesign industries. It is used primarily to speed up the product design cycle time from concept to physical realization\nfor evaluation; it is now gaining a foothold in contemporary architectural practice.\nThe typical components produced by these techniques are “desktop-sized” architectural models. The combination\nof the digital CAD environment with the flexibility of the manufacturing process results in almost unlimited geometrical\nfreedom. Practices such as Foster+Partners have taken full advantage of this technology, and it has become an\nintegral, if not essential, part of their architectural design process (De Kestelier and Peters 2008).\nA number of protagonists are taking the Rapid Prototyping concept a stage further by developing large-scale\nprocesses capable of printing architectural components; there are even claims of the ability to produce whole\nbuildings. These processes will give the architect a new palette of choice in terms of component design, and\npromise similar levels of geometric freedom as the Rapid Prototyping counterparts.\nRapid Prototyping processes, however, cannot simply be scaled up. There is critical interdependency between\nmaterial properties, process function, and design objectives that generates specific problems. The increase in\nscale and print resolution of the built components requires much greater care over how the material is deposited,\nbecause the effects of the deposition have a visual impact, as they can be seen on the construction components.\nTraditional 3D CAD packages combined with the de-facto information protocols used to drive Rapid Prototyping\nmachines fall short of this desired control. A design environment that allows for the design of construction-scale\ncomponents using the material and process constraints and that provides greater control of the material deposition\nis required if the impact of the architectural features these processes produce is to be maximized.\nThis paper is presented broadly in two halves. The first provides an engineering perspective on the background\nand context, introducing Rapid Prototyping and, in particular, the three principal large-scale construction processes\ncurrently under development. One of these processes will be described in more detail. The second part considers\nthe architectural design challenges presented by a new manufacturing process, and the new design environment\nis described alongside this.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n201\n\nA Digital Design Environment for Large Scale Rapid\nManufacturing\n2 Rapid Prototyping, Rapid Manufacturing and Freeform\nFabrication\nIn the manufacturing sector, automation using industrial robots and machines with direct numerical control took hold in\nthe 1960s. CNC developed through the 1970s and 1980s where the computer revolution initiated the development of\ncomputer-aided design software (Howe 2000; Kolarevic 2003; Schodek et al, 2005).\nIn the field of product design, the CAD environment allowed for the digital design of products, but the production of a\nprototype model for aesthetic and/or functional testing needed to be manufactured by hand. In the 1980s, the first layerbased manufacturing process that made it possible for a physical model to be created directly from CAD data emerged.\nThis significantly reduced the cycle time for the evaluation of product prototypes, and Rapid Prototyping was established.\nRapid Prototyping works through one of two methods: selective material phase change or selective material deposition.\nThere are many processes, all of which operate on the principle of building the object out of sequential layers. Selective\nLaser Sintering is one technique that uses nylon or metal powder and a laser. A “sheet” of powder is spread over the\nbuild area, and the laser is used to sinter those areas that need to be solid. The next layer of powder then fuses to the\nprevious layer. The resultant part ends up encased in a “cake” of unsintered powder, from which it is removed after the\nbuild is complete. Some processes fully melt rather than sinter, producing parts that approach 100 percent density and\nwith even fewer defects than conventional casting. A popular process for architectural modeling is 3D printing, which\nuses a powdered gypsum compound that is made solid by selectively applying a binding agent. Both technologies are\nexamples of selective material phase change.\nTechniques such as Fused Deposition Modeling use selective material deposition and involve the continuous extrusion\nof a thermoplastic that fuses together. A second material is used to support overhanging sections; this is broken off the\nbuilt part and discarded (Wohlers 2004).\nOver the last 25 years, there have been\nconsiderable developments in materials, and\nthis has allowed end-use parts to be created on\nthese Rapid Prototyping machines, hence, the\ndevelopment of the more contemporary name,\nRapid Manufacturing. The dimensions of the\nbuild chamber limit the part size. Some process\nwork on very small parts to high tolerances.\nSome specialist machines are quite large, up\nto 800 mm by 1000 mm by 2000 mm. Some\ndevices are similar in scale to most office items,\nsuch as a freestanding photocopier. Typically,\nhowever, a built bed up to 500 mm in the x, y,\nand z directions is used.\n\nFigure 1 Contour\nCrafting\n\nThe principal benefit of Rapid Manufacturing is that it offers “unlimited” geometry at no extra cost,\nso that components can be manufactured with very complex forms or as complete assemblies\nor a complete solid object. The production cost has a linear relationship with component volume\nbecause the part cost is a function of material cost only. This compares to traditional methods that\nare required to recoup high tooling costs. In fact, (Hopkinson, Dickens 2003) demonstrated that\nrapid manufacturing is cost effective for low volume production.\nRapid Manufacturing is finding its niche market wherever customization or personalization is\nrequired, and is changing the way products are conceived and designed. Medical reconstructive\nsurgery and dental products such as the Invisalign tool aligning system are examples (Invisalign\n2006).\nOver recent years, there have been a number of processes developed that take Rapid\nManufacturing into the production of construction and architectural components. Probably the first\nto be developed was a selectively bonded sand and cement process that used an autoclave to\nharden the material, but the work did not progress any further (Buswell 2007).\nToday, worldwide, there are three approaches under development for construction and architectural\napplications. These are large-scale Rapid Manufacturing, or Freeform Construction processes:\n• Contour Crafting;\n• D-Shape (formally monolite); and\n• Concrete Printing.\n\n202\n\nFigure 2 D-Shape\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nA Digital Design Environment for Large Scale Rapid\nManufacturing\nContour Crafting (fig. 1) has been demonstrated in the laboratory at the University of Southern California. It is capable\nof producing full-scale, freeform wall structures that would replace the structural concrete block wall similar to that\nfound in UK house construction. The process is based on extruding a permanent shutter that forms the external wall\nsurfaces, which is then back-filled with a cement material. The approach is focused on the ability to rapidly build walls\nfor buildings.\nD-Shape (fig. 2) is based on the principles of a 3D\nprinter and uses sand as the build material and a binder,\nwhich is sprayed onto the surface of each sequential\nlayer. The process hardens over time, and the part is\nbuilt inside a “cake” of powder, which must then be\nremoved, post build.\nConcrete Printing (fig. 3) is under development at\nLoughborough University, UK, and is based on extruding\na bead of material in much the same way as the FDM\nprocess. The advantages of this approach are that the\ncontrol of the extrusion diameter gives the required\ncontrol over print resolution, and the extrusion process\nhas been demonstrated with different materials. The\nbuild process works on the principle of the deposition\nof two materials, one that is the “build” material and one\nthat is the “support” material, which is deposited as\nneeded to support overhanging sections of the part, and\nthen removed after the build is complete.\nFigure 3 Concrete\nPrinting\n\n3 A Digital Design Environment for Freeform Construction\nprocesses\nThis section discusses the relationship between the architecture of CAD/CAM software and manufacturing processes,\nand then focuses on the development of a new CAD/CAM tool for one of the Freeform Construction Processes:\nConcrete Printing.\n\n3.1 CAD modeling and manufacturing processes\nDigital design environments such as CAD systems have often been developed to emulate manufacturing processes.\nA substantial part of the manufacturing processes are subtractive (Thompson 2007). The desired product or\ncomponent is shaped by subtracting (milling, cutting) material from a base. CAD/CAM software has often been\ndeveloped with this subtractive process in mind. The digital design environment simulates this subtractive process.\nTypical CAD operations are tapering, chamfering, blending, and shelling. All these operations subtract material from\na base volume that subscribes the required model.\nCAD/CAM software has been developed not only to design, but also to create the coded instructions used to\nautomate these processes through Computer Numeric Control (CNC) Machining.\nCAD/CAM environments are often set up in direct relation to the process of fabrication. Rapid Manufacturing methods\nare additive processes since they add material to the object until it is complete. Until now, Rapid Manufacturing has\nadopted the CAD/CAM and digital design environments of the subtractive manufacturing processes.\n\n3.2 Workflow for Rapid Prototyping of architectural models\nFreeform fabrication and, in this case, Concrete Printing, is in its infancy and does not have a standardized\nCAD/CAM design environment or workflow. The most similar workflow to Concrete Printing is probably Rapid\nPrototyping of architectural models. This workflow can be used as the start of a design and workflow framework\nfor this new process.\nAtypical workflow for the Rapid Prototyping of architectural models is given by De Kestelier and Peters (2008) and\ncovered in brief here. A digital 3D model is made within an Architectural Engineering and Construction (AEC) CAD\npackage. From this 3D model, an STL file is exported. STL is the initialism of Stereo-Lithography, or Standard\nTriangulation Language, and is a file format that describes the surface geometry of a three-dimensional object as a\ntriangulated geometry. It does not have a representation of color, texture, or other common CAD model attributes.\nDepending on the Rapid Prototyping technique used, the STL file is then imported into a software package that\nwill translate this file into a format that is readable by the manufacturing device, often manufacturer specific. The\nsoftware will slice the 3D model in horizontal slices. This slicing will define the horizontal contour lines of the model,\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n203\n\nA Digital Design Environment for Large Scale Rapid\nManufacturing\nand what is inside or outside these contour lines, defining which sections of the part are solid and which are not.\nThis will then define where the device deposits material, or where phase change is initiated.\nThe machine will typically action the creation of a solid layer in a prescribed sequence; this is often done by first\ntracing the contours that define the solid/non-solid boundaries and then filling the solid areas within these contours\nwith a hatching pattern. The way a machine hatches or traces contours is related to the detail of the machine\nprocess and material properties, and the pattern is created using fairly standard algorithms.\nAn important feature of any process is the layer depth, since this will define the quality of the surface of the object.\nThis resolution can be around 0.1 mm, so for applications such as architectural modeling, it is not significant.\nFigure 4 Digital Test\nModel for FC Process;\nand G-Code Generation\n\n3.3 Concrete Printing-specific CAD software and data translation\nworkflow\nFreeform Construction processes are currently adopting the\nconventions established in Rapid Prototyping or Manufacturing.\nA key difference is the relative size of the layer depth or “print\nresolution.” In Rapid Prototyping, the layer depth is approximately\n0.1 mm in say a 100 mm high component—a ratio of 1:1000.\nThe Concrete Printing process, however, works between 5 mm\nand 20 mm in 1500 mm; this is, at best, a ratio of 1:300, an\nincrease by a factor of 3. What this means in practice is that the\nbuild resolution can be seen with the naked eye, and this has\nimplications for the design.\nConcrete Printing uses an extruded bead (6 mm high by 9\nmm wide) to deposit material. The first digital test models for\nConcrete Printing were created in standard CAD packages such\nas Solidworks and Microstation (fig. 4). These models were then\nexported to an STL format and exported to a specialist tool\ndeveloped for the Concrete Printing process to slice the model\nin horizontal layers and to hatch the solid sections. These lines are the “tool paths” and can be translated to a set\nof instructions or G-code that will drive the machine.\n\nFigure 5 Resolution\nof Concrete Printing\n\nUsing the Rapid Manufacturing workflow process for Concrete Printing does not take into account the visibility of\nthe layer depth, which is approximately 100 times larger (fig. 5). This resolution has an impact on the aesthetics\nof the part. In contrast with conventional Rapid Manufacturing, the shape and hatching strategy is essential to the\nfinal aesthetics of the part. The conventional design environments have only very limited control over the hatching\nand contouring pattern, and there are many possibilities such as that given in figure 6.\n\n204\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nA Digital Design Environment for Large Scale Rapid\nManufacturing\nFigure 6\nCustom-Designed\nContinuous\nHatching Pattern\n\nAlmost all Rapid Manufacturing processes work on the basis of horizontal slicing; the height generated by this\nsequential layering is usually called the z-height (hatching and contouring on a given layer occurs in the x and y\ndirections). With a visible building resolution, however, it is easy to imagine how to create tool paths that occur in\nall three dimensions (fig. 7). With Rapid Prototyping software packages, all the slicing is done purely horizontally,\nand the G-code follows that concept.\n\nFigure 7\nThree-Dimensional\nTool Paths\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nEach designed feature must be a multiple of the minimum build resolution, and this should be designed into the\nCAD software so that the design is implicitly achievable in terms of practical machine limitations and resultant\naesthetics. In addition, a designer would find great benefit in seeing the object in a more realistic representation\nthat truly represents the manufactured object. An appropriate approach to achieve this is to model the material\nextrusions explicitly, using the tool-path instructions.\n\n205\n\nA Digital Design Environment for Large Scale Rapid\nManufacturing\nFigure 8\nG-Code Toolkit\n\nA custom piece of software, called G-code Toolkit, has been developed specifically for the Concrete Printing\nprocess (De Kestelier, Bernaerdt and Van Hauwaert, 2009) (fig. 8). This toolkit allows the user to import an STL file\nand, subsequently, slice this file horizontally according to the printing resolution. The user then has the choice in\nusing contour lines and different hatching patterns. These patterns can be controlled layer by layer. Each layer can\nhave a different hatching pattern. The tool paths that are created through this hatching process can be visualized\nwith the software. In this way, the hatching pattern and the size of the extrusion can be checked for their visual\nand esthetical implications (figs. 9, 10).\nFigure 9 G-Code\nToolkit Workflow\nFigure 10\nHatching Patterns\nGenerated with the\nG-Code Toolkit\n\nA second design tool has been developed to generate the machine code that will drive the concrete printer (De\nKestelier, Bernaerdt and Van Hauwaert, 2009). This tool is at the moment written as a plug-in for 3D Studio but\nshould soon be implemented in the G-code Toolkit. This script starts from a set of lines that represent the tool\npath of the printer. The user can now very precisely control the start point and end point, and the order in which\nthe tool paths will be printed (fig. 11). This G-code generator also incorporates a G-code dialect that is specific\nfor the Concrete Printing process.\n\n206\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nA Digital Design Environment for Large Scale Rapid\nManufacturing\n4 Concrete Printing a ‘Freeform wall’\nExploring Concrete Printing on a larger scale is the Freeform Construction Group at Loughborough University; they\nhave been developing the design of a large “Freeform wall.” Building a large prototype helps evaluate the hardware\nand the material development, and serves as a test case for developing a new design environment.\nThe wall is built up from a central B-spline curve in-plane and has a gradually changing thickness along its length,\nessentially an extrusion in the z direction (fig. 12). A parametric model was created within Generative Components,\nwhich is a parametric modeler built on the CAD modeler, Microstation. Generative Components is mainly used in\nthe AEC industry.\n\nWonderwall\n\n144\n\nPart 5\n\nfig. 5.37 Final design: 3 layers defining the “WonderWall”\n\nFigure 11 G-Code\nExporter Script\nfor 3D Studio\n\nFigure 12\nFreeform Wall\n\nInstead of modeling the wall as a volume, the wall is being directly built up out of a set of lines. These lines represent\nthe tool paths or extrusion contours and patterns. A parametric logic is built up so that these lines can be edited and\ntransformed in one go, without the need for editing each tool path separately.\nThe parametric model of the wall is created in such a way that the following features can be adjusted: a 4th-order\nB-spline curve controls the central spine of the wall, and a law curve, whose values are limited by a minimum and a\nmaximum, control the changes in the overall thickness (fig. 13).\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n207\n\nA Digital Design Environment for Large Scale Rapid\nManufacturing\nFigure 13 Parametric\nModel for Freeform\nPrototype Wall\n\nThe model is set up by polylines and B-spline curves. All polylines and B-splines are in a constant parallel offset,\nequivalent to the extrusion diameter. The concept is to build the construction method into the parametric model;\nrather than building a geometric volume, the wall is build up by its tool paths. These tool paths can then be “tubed”\nto render a visual representation of the printed object. These tool paths can be exported to a DWG format, which is\nthen the import data for the Concrete Printing G-code generator script.\n\nConclusion\nThe use of Rapid Prototyping has inspired different industries to research the possibility of using these layered\nmanufacturing processes for actual production, and not only for prototyping. In the last few years, different universities\nand companies have developed a few experimental processes to test the possibility of applying Rapid Manufacturing\nin the construction industry. By designing prototype objects for the Concrete Printing process in particular, it became\napparent that new ways of designing are necessary. There will be the need for different CAD environments that are\nfine-tuned towards Freeform Construction methods. These design environments will need to have the notion of the\nfabrication process embedded in its modeling tools. The data translation workflows will also need to be adapted\ntowards a design environment where the actual tool paths can be manipulated. There seems to be the need to shift\nto designing with collections of parametrically controlled tool paths, rather than with explicit geometrical volumes.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was carried out as a collaboration between the department of Civil and Building Engineering at\nLoughborough University, UK, the Specialist Modelling Group from Foster+Partners, UK, and the Architecture &\nUrban Planning department of the University of Gent, Belgium, where the software was developed.\nThe Concrete Printing Process on which this paper was based is an ongoing research project between the department\nof Civil and Building Engineering at Loughborough University and UK industry, including Foster+Partners, Buro\nHappold, and Shotcrete.

Brought into being through complex yet common\neveryday techno-social practices, these hybrids rely on the wireless spectrum to enable a variety of media, information,\nand communications events that continually make and remake the spatial conditions of urban life. This paper examines\nthe relations between this Hertzian space and the architecture of urban environments. Building on a longstanding\ndiscourse surrounding the material and immaterial limits of urban architecture, it asks how we might begin to think\nabout shaping the Hertzian space of contemporary cities through the practices and promises of urban computing\nand locative media. Coaxing architecture beyond its professional and disciplinary boundaries and, at the same time,\nrecasting contemporary media art within broader social, cultural, and political contexts of urban space, the essay\nattempts to outline a conversation between these fields of practice that share a common theater of operations: that of\nthe contemporary city.\nFigure 1 Gloop 4\nCommunications in\nLiving City, Archigram,\nLiving Arts No. 2, 1963\n\n1 Beyond Materiality in Architecture\nWhen it is raining in Oxford Street the architecture is no more important than the rain, in fact the weather has probably\nmore to do with the pulsation of the Living City at that given moment (Cook 1963).\nIn the introduction to an issue of Living Arts magazine published in 1963, British architect Peter Cook claimed\nthat architecture, at least as it was traditionally conceived, no longer played a significant role in shaping the urban\nexperience. This issue of Living Arts was a catalog for “Living City,” an exhibition organized by the young British\narchitecture collective Archigram and presented at the Institute for Contemporary Art (ICA) in London. At the time\nof the exhibition, “swinging” London epitomized the modernization of British cities in the 1950s and 1960s (Sadler\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n209\n\nToward an Architecture of Hertzian Space\nFigure 2 Living City\nSurvival Kit, Warren\nChalk, 1963\n\n2005). The glare of neon lights, the proliferation of urban advertising, the glitter and glam of new (American) products displayed in\nstorefront windows, or the horror of “garishly decorated restaurants” (Brooker 1969, 269)—this illuminated “pop” city became the\ncurse of “proper” British architects and urban planners. This urban vernacular, “Living City” claimed, made fussing with the detailing\nof urban facades or interior lobbies irrelevant, as people on the street received them as fragments, at best, being more influenced\nby ambient, immaterial, and kinetic forces than by the detailed formal articulation of space and material.\nIn the face of contemporary conditions, declaring a crisis in architecture as a means of arguing for its reinvention is a classic—\nindeed, a well-worn—tactic. Thirty years after “Living City,” Rem Koolhaas introduced the concepts of Junkspace and the Generic\nCity to describe the global, undifferentiated extension of built space, where the drive toward Bigness supersedes the attentive\ndetailing of architectural and urban design. Declaring, “The city is no longer. We can leave the theatre now” (Koolhaas 1995), he\nechoes Archigram’s assessment that the “old” tools, techniques, and obsessions of architecture are no longer relevant to current\nconditions. “People can inhabit anything,” he claims. “And they can be miserable in anything and ecstatic in anything. More and\nmore I think that architecture has nothing to do with it” (Heron 1996).\nToday, as the data clouds of the twenty-first century descend on the streets, sidewalks, and squares of contemporary cities, we\nmight ask: to what extent are these Hertzian weather systems becoming “as important, possibly more important” than built form\nin shaping our experience of the city? On any given day, we pass through transportation systems using magnetic stripe or Radio\nFrequency ID (RFID) tags to pay a fare; we coordinate meeting times and places through SMS text messaging on the run; we\ncluster in cafes and parks where WiFi is free; we move in and out of spaces blanketed by CCTV surveillance cameras; and we\ncurse our wireless provider when its cell towers are not in reliable range of our place of residence. Hertzian space is all around us,\ncoming in waves of various frequencies, lengths, and intervals, embedded in manifold ways within the course of our everyday lives.\nGiven these conditions, how might we begin to think about how to shape these environments? To what extent can we see this as a\nway of practicing a new kind of urban architecture? Recent work on urban computing and locative media has begun to examine the\nlarger urban implications of the proliferation of mobile, embedded, wireless, and pervasive computing technologies throughout the\nmaterial fabric of everyday life (Crang and Graham 2007; Dave 2007; Ellison et al. 2007; Galloway 2004; Greenfield 2006; Shepard\nand Greenfield 2007; Kindberg et al. 2007; Shklovski and Chang 2006). Yet, surprisingly, little work has been done to place these\ntechnological developments within the larger context of public at large as a radical statement from young upstarts operating at the\nperiphery of the architectural establishment. It would be many years before Archigram would build anything at all, preferring the\nspeed and expedience of publishing architectural zines over the patient practice involved in making buildings.\n\n210\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nToward an Architecture of Hertzian Space\nIn the passages that follow, I attempt to cast issues of urban computing and locative media in terms of a broader and longstanding discourse on architecture and urban space. My intent is not to lay professional or disciplinary claim to this still relatively\nuncharted territory. Rather, I am interested in examining how this dialogue between technology, sociality and urban space\nnot only offers a new opportunity to bring architecture beyond itself but also opens new avenues for critical exploration in the\nevolving and related fields of urban computing and locative media.\n\n2 Enacted Space\nThe modern city exists as a haze of software instructions. Nearly every urban practice is mediated by code. (Amin and Thrift\n2002, 125)\nTwo years prior to “Living City,” author and urban activist Jane Jacobs published her influential book The Death and Life of Great\nAmerican Cities (Jacobs 1961). In one extended passage, she describes the cycle of daily (and nightly) activity transpiring on\nHudson Street, located in her neighborhood on the Lower West Side of Manhattan. This narrative of a sidewalk “ballet,” as she\ncalls it, takes the form of a list of casual events, encounters, and interactions between neighbors, workers, and passers-by:\nMr Halpert unlocking the laundry’s handcart from its mooring to a cellar door, Joe Cornacchia’s son-in-law stacking out the\nempty crates from the delicatessen, the barber bringing out his sidewalk folding chair... Simultaneously, numbers of women\nin housedresses have emerged and as they crisscross with one another they pause for quick conversations that sound with\neither laughter or joint indignation, never, it seems, anything between... Longshoremen who are not working that day gather at\nthe White Horse or the Ideal or the International for beer and conversation... As darkness thickens... the ballet goes on under\nlights, eddying back and forth but intensifying at the bright spotlight pools of Joe’s sidewalk pizza dispensary, the bars, the\ndelicatessen, the restaurant and the drug store. (Jacobs 1961, 52–53)\nIf Archigram viewed the city as an environment that conditions our emotions, today, the “feel” of the street is defined less and\nless by what we can see with the naked eye (Hill 2008). Taking a cue from Jacobs, Dan Hill describes the informational ballet\ntranspiring on a typical street today in terms of what we cannot see:\nWe can’t see how the street is immersed in a twitching, pulsing cloud of data... This is a new kind of data, collective and\nindividual, aggregated and discrete, open and closed, constantly logging impossibly detailed patterns of behavior. The behavior\nof the street.\nSuch data emerges from the feet of three friends, grimly jogging past, whose Nike+ shoes track the frequency and duration\nof every step, comparing against pre-set targets for each individual runner. This is cross-referenced with playlist data emerging\nfrom their three iPods. Similar performance data is being captured in the engine control systems of a stationary BMW waiting at\na traffic light, beaming information back to the BMW service centre associated with the car’s owner.\nThe traffic light system itself is capturing and collating data about traffic and pedestrian flow, based on real-time patterns\nsurrounding the light, and conveying the state of congestion in the neighborhood to the traffic planning authority for that region,\nwhich alters the lights’ behavior accordingly...\nIn an adjacent newsagent’s, the stock control system updates as a newspaper is purchased, with data about\nconsumption emerging from the EFTPOS system used to purchase the paper, triggering transactions in the customer’s\nbank account records.\nData emerges from the seven simultaneous phone conversations (with one call via Skype and six cellular phones) amongst the\ngroup of people waiting at the pedestrian crossing nearest the newsagent.\nTo understand the implications of this folding of people, street, and data onto each other requires thinking about space in nonvisual ways, where formal geometry and material articulation become less relevant than the topologies of networked information\nsystems and their intersection with the socio-spatial practices of daily life. Martin Dodge and Rob Kitchen have suggested\nthat these kinds of “code/space” need to be understood ontogenetically, that is, as something continually brought into being\nthrough specific practices that alter the conditions under which the space itself is (re)produced. Building on the work of Adrian\nMacKenzie (2002; 2003), they differentiate between technicity (the productive power of technology to make things happen)\nand its realization through transduction (the constant making anew of a domain in reiterative and transformative practices)\n(Dodge and Kitchen 2003). These assemblages of code, people, and space, thus, are brought into being through specific\ntechno-social performances or enactments within the course of daily life.\n\n3 The Mobile Device as Territory Machine\nImagine Hegel, Marx and McLuhan encountering the keitai [mobile phone] of the twenty-first century. Georg Hegel is astonished\nat seeing the spirit of the era dwelling persistently in our palms. Karl Marx complains that it is an alienating fetish object. Marshall\nMcLuhan, his eyes sparkling, chimes in that it will turn the whole world into a village—no, a house. But in the next moment, he\ncomes upon a realization that appalls him. “But wait!,” he exclaims. “My wife and children will have the equivalent of a private\nroom with a twenty-four-hour doorway to the outside world, fully equipped with a TV, a bed, and even a bathroom. Where would\nmy place be in such a house?” (Fujimoto 2006)\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n211\n\nToward an Architecture of Hertzian Space\nToday, a new approach to the old problem of “programming” space arises with contemporary everyday practices\ninvolving mobile devices and wireless information systems. In Japan, for example, the mobile phone has been described\nby Kenichi Fujimoto as a personal “territory machine,” capable of transforming any space—a subway train seat, a grocery\nstore aisle, a street corner—into one’s own room and personal paradise. Born out of the so-called girl’s pager revolution\nof the 1990s, the mobile phone became a key weapon in a young Japanese girl’s arsenal for waging gender warfare\nagainst older “raspy and thick-voiced” oyaji, intent on peeping at young female bodies from behind a newspaper. Armed\nwith her keitai, speaking freely in a high-pitched voice, “wearing loose socks and munching snacks,” these kogyaru\n“couldn’t care less if a subhuman oyaji peeked at their underwear or eavesdropped on their conversations” (Fujimoto\n2006, 98). These techno-social practices remade space in the Japanese city in new ways, transforming the paternalistic\ncommunities of city streets and subway cars into private territories for women and children.\nIn the West, spatial practices involving the iPod are, perhaps, more familiar. Michael Bull (2000) has studied how people use\nthese devices to mitigate the contingencies of daily life. On one level, the iPod enables one to personalize the experience\nof the contemporary city with one’s own music collection. When you are on the bus, at lunch in the park, or shopping in the\ndeli, the city becomes a film for which you compose the soundtrack. The iPod also provides gradients of privacy in public\nplaces, affording the listener certain exceptions to conventions for social interaction within the public domain. Donning a pair\nof earbuds grants the wearer a certain amount of social license, enabling one to move through the city without necessarily\ngetting too involved and, to some extent, absolving one from responsibility to respond to what is happening around one.\nSome people use earbuds to deflect unwanted attention, finding it easier to avoid responding because they look already\noccupied. Faced with two people on the sidewalk, we will likely ask the one without earbuds for directions to the nearest\nsubway entrance. In the same way, removing one’s earbuds when talking to someone pays the speaker a compliment. So,\nin effect, the iPod becomes a tool for organizing space, time, and the boundaries around the body in public space.\nWhat is significant here is that as these mobile devices become ubiquitous in urban environments (and in many\nplaces they already are), the technicity of architecture as the primary technology of space making is challenged by the\nspatial transductions these devices afford. Regardless of the formal geometries and material arrangements of a space\nas defined by architecture, and irrespective of the normative activities or uses encoded (or elicited) by its program,\nthese devices and the ways in which we use them have, in fact, become as important as, if not more important than,\narchitecture in shaping our experience of urban space.\n\n4 Urban Computing, Locative Media, and the Read/Write City\nWith Apple’s introduction of the iPhone G3 in the summer of 2008, urban computing and locative media—formerly\nindicating somewhat experimental research or artist-driven explorations of “near-future” technologies—are now being\nmainstreamed to the masses. Moreover, while the business of forecasting future trends in technology is fraught with\nintellectual peril, a few projections, based on technologies that are now readily available to many, can reasonably be\nmade. Above all, we are beginning to see social practices emerge by which location-based or context-aware media\nand information are consumed in urban environments, and, in turn, urban space is transduced. Yet, the implications for\narchitecture and urbanism remain far from clear.\nOne observation is that the way we read the city is changing. As Varnelis and Meisterlin (2008) note:\nAs we have grown accustomed to navigating the city with\nour smartphones and our printouts from Google maps, we\nhave come to know it from above, as a two-dimensional,\nplanimetric experience. Instead of seeing ourselves as\npart of the city fabric, inhabiting a three-dimensional urban\ncondition, we dwell in a permanent out-of-body experience,\ndisplaced from our own locations, seeing ourselves as\nmoving dots or pins on a map.\n\nFigure 3 Amsterdam\nRealtime, Esther Polak,\n2002\n\nHere, the emphasis on reading the city through “intelligent”\nmaps, and on the implications for urban experience of the\nhabitual patterns by which we use them, implies forms of\npassive consumption with which we are all likely familiar. The\ncity becomes a network of nodes and pathways through\nwhich we circulate like data packets. If every extension of our\ncapabilities leads to a corresponding amputation of another\n(McLuhan 1964), clearly wayfinding skills grounded in physical\ngeographies run the risk of atrophy in an age of intelligent\nmaps. Reports of mishaps stemming from reliance on GPSenabled SatNav devices are becoming common. Recently, the London Daily Mirror reported that these devices have been\nresponsible for at least 300,000 accidents, including that of Paula Ceely, 20, of Wales, who “vowed never to listen to her\nSatNav again after she was directed into the path of a speeding train at the Ffynnongain level crossing in Wales. The train\nslammed into her car, leaving the student within inches of her life” (Carey 2008). Fortunately, no one was hurt in this instance.\n\n212\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nToward an Architecture of Hertzian Space\nIf location-based technologies such as GPS navigation systems can lead to both a disembodied experience of the\ncity as well as potential bodily harm, this has as much to do with the ways in which we use the technologies and the\npractices by which this space is enacted as it does with the technology itself. In this regard, revisiting early work in\nlocative media that focuses on urban environments is instructive. Amsterdam Realtime (2002), a project by the WAAG\nsociety in association with Esther Polak, traced movements through the city of people carrying GPS-enabled devices,\nwhich transmitted their location in real time to a remote server that, in turn, projected these movements as an animated\n“map” in an art gallery (realtime.waag.org). This map represented the city not as a static network of streets, buildings,\nand spaces, but as a series of traces that aggregate over time to represent the city as different people traverse it. Here,\nthe traditional authority attributed to maps and their ability to structure the way we navigate cities is subverted. Rather\nthan a map that informs how one moves through a city, one’s movements inform the map.\nFurther, the ability not only to read, in situ, bits of media and information associated with specific locations in the city,\nbut also to write or otherwise add geocoded data to these urban data clouds, leads to more subtle shifts in the way\nwe experience the city and the choices we make within it. As McCullough (2006) notes, cities have throughout history\nbeen inscribed by various information layers that shape our experience of urban space, be they “grand expressions\ncarved in stone facades, mundane signage in the streets,” or smaller markings identifying significant sites or directing\ntraffic and pedestrian flow. These urban annotations, in the past, have been governed by various public and private\nagencies, defined by different communities of practice: utilities providers, tax assessors, insurance underwriters, urban\nhistorians. When open to public consumption, these markings have generally served specific private interests, such as\nlocal business improvement districts (BIDs) or community associations. One of the more significant aspects of urban\ncomputing and locative media is how they open up the process of urban annotation by enabling ordinary people to\ncontribute to the information layer overlaid on contemporary cities.\n\n5 Toward An Architecture of Hertzian SpacE\nThe Hertzian space of cities, once the territory of governmental agencies, private enterprise, and networks of ham radio\noperators, has evolved into a dynamic and contested site, where many competing interests are beginning to shape a\nnew information overlay. In addition to and, indeed, beyond the established frequencies of radio waves carrying radio\nand television programs, police communications, and other wireless signals, today’s urban data clouds are made\nup of “a new kind of data, collective and individual, aggregated and discrete, open and closed, constantly logging\ndetailed patterns of behavior” (Hill 2008). This is the behavior of the street: constantly enacting new spatial relations\nand organizational adjacencies that are every bit as architectural as the formal articulations of bricks and mortar that\nconstitute the traditional city. That this urban ballet of people, data, and space is predominantly non-visual should\nbe less a detracting factor than an intellectual challenge to those invested in the design of urban space. Beneath\nthe threshold of public vision, a new city is emerging, one requiring new methods and techniques by which we can\nproductively engage in its design and formation.\n\nFigure 4\nLife: a user’s manual,\nMichelle Teran, 2003\n\nAs with other aspects of the physical world, such as land, water, and air, the electromagnetic spectrum is a limited\nresource. Under US law, the spectrum is considered neither private property nor that of the federal, state, or local\ngovernment. Regulating the use of these abstract frequency bands has become essential, however, in order to limit\ninterference between competing uses. Hardin’s “Tragedy of the Commons” (1968) illustrates the dilemma in which\nmultiple individuals acting independently in their own self-interest can ultimately destroy a shared resource, even when\neveryone knows this is in no one’s long-term interest. This has led to the effective privatization of parts of the spectrum,\nsuch as when the US government, in 2008, auctioned off to the telecommunications industry the 700 MHz band\npreviously reserved for analog television broadcasting.\nYet, if parts of the wireless spectrum have become effectively\nreserved for private use, a kind of “public” space exists in the form\nof the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio bands. Because\ncommunication devices using the ISM bands must tolerate any\ninterference from ISM equipment, these bands are typically given\nover to uses intended for unlicensed operation, since these devices\ntypically need to be tolerant of interference from other devices\nanyway. ISM frequencies such as the 2.4 GHz band are set\naside for license-free use by systems and devices such as WiFi,\nBluetooth, cordless phones, and wireless surveillance cameras,\nand it is within this frequency range that a number of recent projects\nhave attempted both to probe and to shape this new public terrain.\n“Life: a user’s manual” (2003), a project by Michelle Teran, is a\nseries of public performances and online mappings that examine\nthe hidden stories captured by private wireless CCTV streams, and\nhow they intersect with the visible world around us (www.ubermatic.org/life). The project employs a low-cost, consumergrade wireless video receiver to capture live image feeds from private wireless surveillance cameras, and create a\nsequence of views into the spaces and lives of the city and its inhabitants while they are walking down the street.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n213\n\nToward an Architecture of Hertzian Space\nAs Terran notes, “Private use of wireless internet, cordless phones, bluetooth\nand wireless surveillance cameras has turned the average consumer into\n‘micro-broadcasters’ who transmit their personal narratives through the\nairwaves.” Here, nominally private territory is rendered in a highly public way by\nconducting walking tours through Hertzian space, where the intimate details of\neveryday urban lives are exposed to the tour participants and passers-by alike.\nJonah Brucker-Cohen’s WiFi Hog (2003) is a project that addresses the\nproliferation of free wireless nodes in public parks, airports, libraries, and\nschools, and the corresponding encroachment on this space by corporate\npay-per-use providers competing for signal dominance (www.mee.tcd.\nie/~bruckerj/projects/wifihog.html). Brucker-Cohen describes the project\nas “a personal tool to enable both private interaction in public space as well\nas social obstruction and deconstruction of shared resources.” The tool\nconsists of a WiFi-enabled laptop connected to a Portable Video Jammer\n(PVJ), which is able to block network access to open nodes for Internet\ntraffic not originating from the WiFi-Hogger’s IP address. By allowing a\nmeans of control to come from anyone, not just corporate or community\nwireless network operators, WiFi Hog subverts claims of ownership and\nregulation over free, unlicensed bands of the spectrum.\nThe Tactical Sound Garden [TSG] Toolkit (2006) is an open source software\nplatform for shaping the sonic topography of urban public space (www.\ntacticalsoundgarden.net). The Toolkit enables anyone living within dense 802.11 wireless (WiFi) “hot zones”\nto install a “sound garden” for public use. Using a WiFi enabled mobile device (PDA, laptop, mobile phone),\nparticipants “plant” sounds within a positional audio environment. These plantings are mapped onto the coordinates\nof a physical location by a 3D audio engine common to gaming environments—overlaying a publicly constructed\nsoundscape onto a specific urban space. Wearing headphones connected to a WiFi enabled device, participants\ndrift through virtual sound gardens as they move throughout the city. The project draws on the culture of urban\ncommunity gardening to posit a participatory environment, where new spatial practices and social interactions\nwithin technologically mediated environments can be explored and evaluated.\n\nFigure 5\nWiFi Hog, Jonah\nBrucker-Cohen, 2003\n\nFigure 6 Tactical Sound\nGarden [TSG] Toolkit,\nMark Shepard, 2006\n\nThere are many other examples one could mention; more are appearing each week on blogs maintained by art and\ntechnology enthusiasts, as well as software developers and application distributors worldwide. Few, however, take the\nlarger urban environment and its attendant challenges and opportunities—historically the purview of architecture and\nurban design—as a context within which to directly intervene, and not simply as another venue for consuming media\nand information.\n\nConclusion\nUrban computing and locative media hold the promise to achieve what architecture and urban design have long\naspired to: opening up the design of urban space to more inclusive and participatory processes, resulting in urban\narchitecture that is adaptable to the increasingly ephemeral forces at play in contemporary cities. Realizing this promise\ninvolves shaping the ambient qualities of Hertzian space as if they were a weather system, and structuring the technosocial practices that continually re-make the spatial conditions shaping our experience of the city.\nSuch an immaterial urban architecture may find little acceptance within a profession so highly invested in the material\npractices of the real estate development and construction industries. Yet, if architecture is to remain relevant vis-à-vis\n\n214\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nToward an Architecture of Hertzian Space\nurban space, it may have no choice but to grow beyond its current professional and disciplinary boundaries. At the\nsame time, if urban computing and locative media are to be considered in terms of their potential to address urban\nconditions, their practices need to be re-evaluated in the larger framework of everyday life and urban public space. Only\nthen, can they move beyond the production of novel experiences for consumer cultures or limited (art) audiences, and\ncritically engage the social, cultural, and political realities of contemporary cities.\n\nReferences\nAmin, A. and N.

Although one could design a building to visually resemble\na natural model (i.e., a house that looks like a cactus), it is more advantageous in many cases to design a built system\nso that it behaves like the model (i.e., a house that reduces heat gain and water loss through a layered wall design). This\npaper explores the potential for using analogies drawn from Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) to create a software\nprogram that simulates selected building materials to predict temporal building temperature variations.\nWhen we draw a connection between the chemical system of the CAM species and the thermal system of a built\nenvironment, we are able to construct a conceptual conversion factor that relates the natural model to the artificial\nproduct via the respective dynamic processes. The conceptual nature of this conversion does not equate a specific\nbiological component to a specific building component. It only allows us to compare the chemical behavior of the\nbiological model to the subsequent building system and its thermodynamic behavior. In this analogy, a building\nenvelope comprised of a layered thermal mass provides the thermodynamic equivalent to the CAM pathway within\nthe cell. A computer program, SonoranSystems, was developed by one of the authors (Wiebe) in order to analyze the\nthermodynamics of a building envelope that is the result of a biomimetic translation of the CAM.\n\n1 Introduction\nClimate responsiveness in architecture is a crucial goal in the pursuit of new building strategies to increase the efficiency\nof the built thermal environment. One method of determining potential strategies is to look towards nature for inspiration.\nBiomimetics is the field of study in which nature serves as “model, mentor, or measure,” as described by the Biomimicry\nInstitute (2009). The natural model can range in the purpose it serves and in the way that it is viewed. For example,\nsucculent cactus species of the Sonoran Desert can be discussed in terms of ecological (relationship to other plants\nand animals), morphological (size, shape), anatomical (internal architecture), and physiological (photosynthesis, CAM)\nadaptations. After investigation of each of these categories of characteristics, we selected the physiological aspect for\nfurther investigation and translation to a building metaphor. Specifically, we used Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM),\na remarkable climate adaptation found in some of the succulent cacti in the Sonoran Desert, as the basis for this project.\nExisting software (that we are aware of) does not have the ability to model thermodynamically the material assemblies under\nconsideration nor to produce output data in the form of temperature profiles, which are necessary steps in the subsequent\ncomparison of the building’s thermodynamic behavior to the metabolic functioning of the CAM plant. One of the authors\n(Wiebe) created a Windows-based application, SonoranSystems, in order to test the building systems that are the product\nof this biomimetic investigation. Using the conversion factor, stomata are translated to thermochromic laminated glazing\n(TLG), cytoplasm and vacuole to thermal mass, and chemical differentials to heat differentials. The application uses hourly\nTMY3 climate data for thirteen cities in the Sonoran Desert and, ultimately, outputs indoor temperatures for a designed\ncase and a reference case. The program simulates a series of material assemblies comprised of TLG, water, concrete,\nand methlymethacrylate (mmc). This program allows the comparison of diurnal metabolic functions with the diurnal heat\ntransfer and temperature profiles of a south-facing wall assembly. In order to compare the chemical behavior of CAM and\nthe thermal behavior of a wall assembly, output will be in the form of temperature profiles.\n\n216\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nSonoranSystems: Building Simulation Modeling Using a\nCrassulacean Acid Metabolism Analogy\n2 The desert and the Crassulacean acid metabolism\nThe hot, arid climate type is characterized by a large temperature range (very low nighttime temperature and very high\ndaytime temperatures), little humidity, and intense solar radiation (Watson 1993). As the psychometric chart shows\n(fig. 1), a number of building strategies that decrease the need for auxiliary HVAC systems already exist. This project\ninvestigates new design methods and strategies for thermal control in a particular place; however, this type of analysis\ncould be extended to other climates and their respective biological adaptations.\nFigure 1 Psychometric\nchart for Yuma,\nArizona from Climate\nConsultant\n\nOptimal rates of photosynthesis\nare dependent on the availability\nof sunlight, water, and carbon\ndioxide. The retention of water\nand carbon dioxide has an\nimportant inverse relationship:\nthe conservation of one may\nhave a detrimental effect on the\nlevel of the other. This becomes\na substantial issue in climates\nwith low humidity and high\ntemperatures: when stomata are\nopen to take in carbon dioxide,\nthey transpire large amounts\nof water, leaving the plant\ndehydrated. It is the necessity\nto both take in carbon dioxide\nand prevent water loss that\nmotivates the development of the\nCrassulacean acid metabolism\n(Davies et al. 1961).\nCAM is an adapted photosynthetic system that mitigates this CO2/H2O collection dilemma. Instead of gathering CO2\nduring the daytime, plants with the CAM system open their stomata only at nighttime when incident solar radiation and\noutdoor temperature are at their minimum. The CO2 gathered at nighttime is stored as malic acid in the cell vacuole,\nand then during daytime hours when sunlight is available, the malic acid is converted to polysaccharides or hexose\nsugars (Kluge and Ting 1978).\nThe CAM is used primarily to conserve water. This adaptation is contingent on two main features: 1) the stomatal\nrhythms and 2) the ability to store carbon dioxide as malic acid for use later in photosynthesis. The diurnal functioning\nof these two mechanisms is highly rhythmic, and there exists a certain level of hysteresis in their daily fluctuations.\n\n3 Simulating biology\nCAM is viewed primarily as a system of chemical reactions, as the daily undulating of concentrations of certain chemical\ncompounds, and as the spatial arrangement of the cell, making these reactions possible. It is modeled as three reactant\npools (internal carbon dioxide concentration, malic acid concentration in the cytoplasm, and malic acid concentration in\nthe vacuole) and three transfer functions, which describe the changes in those concentrations (fig. 2).\nFigure 2 Simulation\nmodel of Crassulacean\nacid metabolism\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n217\n\nSonoranSystems: Building Simulation Modeling Using a\nCrassulacean Acid Metabolism Analogy\nUsing this simplified model from Blasius et al. (1999), we can plot metabolic functioning as a function of temperature, of\nlight, and of external carbon dioxide levels. The variables w, x, y, and z represent the concentration of carbon dioxide in\nthe cytoplasm, the malate concentration in the cytoplasm, the malate concentration in the vacuole, and the tonoplast\norder, respectively. The tonoplast is the membrane of the vacuole, and the tonoplast order is a value that describes\nthe permeability of the membrane at time t. The set of equations that defines this system can be found in the source\ndocument. Using numerical algorithms presented in an earlier paper by Neff et al. (1998), we solved these equations\nand generated the following profiles (figs. 3, 4):\n\nFigure 3 Concentration\nof carbon dioxide in the\ncytoplasm (solid line)\nand concentration of\nmalate in the vacuole\n(dashed line)\n\nThis computer simulation of CAM presented by Blasius et al. (1999)\nis an important characterization of this metabolic adaptation for two\nreasons:\n1) it represents CAM as the simplest set of pools of compounds,\nand their respective differences, that accurately models a much more\ncomplex system, and\n2) the simulated system of reactions induced by differential\nconcentrations can be related to the simulation of heat transfer between\ntemperature nodes via the principle of differentials.\nEmpirical data presented by Kluge and Ting (1978) support and\nsupplement these theoretical graphs (figs. 5, 6).\n\n4 Mimicking materials and\nprocesses\nWe subjected the pieces of this simulation-based model of CAM to\na biomimetic transformation process. The conceptual nature of this\nconversion does not allow us to equate “this biological component” to\n“that building component.” It only allows us to compare the chemical\nbehavior of the biological model to the subsequent building system and\nits thermodynamic behavior.\nStomata are translated to thermochromic laminated glazing (TLG)\ncytoplasm and vacuole to thermal mass, and chemical differentials to\nheat differentials. A building envelope comprised of layered thermal\nmass with a variable barrier layer (thermochromic glazing) provides the thermodynamic equivalent to the CAM pathway\nwithin the cell (fig. 7).\n\nFigure 4 72-hour\nmetabolic profile\n\nThe materials, with their different thicknesses and thermal properties, generate temperature profiles that are out of\nphase with each other, while responding to adjacent material temperatures. The thermal mass materials used are water,\nconcrete, and methylmethacrylate (mmc). Water has been included in this project predominantly for its biomimetic\ncorrespondence to the CAM pathway, but also for the larger role it plays in all scales of the biological system. Concrete\nhas been included because it is a ubiquitous building material that allows for complex forms, tough structures, and\n\n218\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nSonoranSystems: Building Simulation Modeling Using a\nCrassulacean Acid Metabolism Analogy\nFigure 5 Daily fluctuation\nof stomatal resistance of\nOpuntia basilaris\n\nFigure 6 Malic acid\nconcentration in the\nvacuole of Kalanchoe\ntubiflora\n\nsubstantial thermal mass.

They present\nthe spectral transmittance of the TLG\nfor a range of temperatures (fig. 8). This\ngraph is interpolated and extrapolated\nand, with computational methods and\nvalues from ASTM E 971-88 and G 17303, the data is used in SonoranSystems.\nValues for water are taken from Dincer\nand Rosen (2002):\nAlthough there are many varieties of concrete mixtures that have somewhat different physical properties, the following\nvalues are used for this project, taken from Dincer and Rosen (2002):\nAs described in Transwall Versus Trombe Wall (Nayak 1986), a transwall is comprised of two layers of water, separated\nby a piece of semi-transparent material, which, in this case, is methylmethacrylate (mmc) (fig. 9).\nMMC material properties from Nayak (1986):\n\n5 SonoranSystems: thermal model\nIn order to calculate temperature profiles, we must first calculate the\nperpendicular component of the incoming direct, normal radiation. Solar\nangles are calculated for every hour by using equations taken from the\nASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 2005.\nUsing material properties and a combination of conduction, convection, and\nradiation equations, we assembled the following algorithms and used them in SonoranSystems. These equations are\nfor a three-layer wall, but the number of wall layers and temperature nodes can be adjusted (fig. 10).\nTwo buildings are modeled: the design case (where the parameters of the south wall assembly can be changed)\nand the reference building. The design building is modeled to have glazing on the south façade equal to 5 percent\nof the façade area, with standard double-pane (not thermochromic) glazing. For the north, east, and west walls, the\nroof, and one standard-glazed south-facing window, the following thermodynamic values are used:\nFinally, indoor temperature is calculated as the sum of the heat flows into the space from the walls and the roof:\nHourly indoor temperature is plotted against the ambient outdoor dry-bulb temperature, the temperature of each material\n\n220\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nSonoranSystems: Building Simulation Modeling Using a\nCrassulacean Acid Metabolism Analogy\nFigure 9 Transwall\n\nlayer, and the indoor temperature of a reference\ncase.\n\nU w all = 0.147 Wm −2 K −1\nU roof = 0.139 Wm −2 K −1\nU glaze = 3.92 Wm −2 K −1\nThe reference case has all the same dimensions\nand climate conditions as the designed case.\nThe main difference is that all walls, including\nthe south wall, have the same thermodynamic\nproperties as the north, east, and west walls in\nthe design case.

To assemble a wall section, the user\ninputs a thickness, highlights a material, and\nclicks the orange “add layer” button. Material\nlayers must be added sequentially, beginning\nwith the outermost layer. The user can clear\nthe assembly by clicking the brown “clear”\nbutton. If tabular data is required in addition\nto a temperature plot, the user must select\nthe type of assembly from the list of material\ncombinations. Once all variables are specified, hitting the red “next” button will generate the outputs both in the table\non the input screen and in temperature profiles on an output screen (fig. 11).\nIn addition to temperature, SonoranSystems uses a metric similar to a heating or cooling degree-day, using indoor\ntemperatures and a comfort zone instead of weather data and a reference temperature. This metric is called the heating\nzone area and the cooling zone area (units are [degrees Celsius-days]) (fig. 12). In the simulation, the comfort zone is\nset to 20–25 degrees Celsius, but this range can be adjusted if necessary.\nTo generate a temperature profile, the user inputs the information regarding location, building dimensions, and wall\nconstruction. The program will produce a graph of temperature profiles for the time period specified by the user (figures\n13 and 14). For this example the length and width of the building are set to 5m and 3m, respectively, the height of the\nbuilding is 3m, and the location of the building is set at Yuma, Arizona.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n221\n\nSonoranSystems: Building Simulation Modeling Using a\nCrassulacean Acid Metabolism Analogy\nFigure 11 Input screen\nwith table filled with\noutput data\n\nThis graph includes ambient outdoor temperatures (blue), temperatures at each layer of the wall (green, orange), indoor\nair temperature (red), and the indoor air temperature of the reference case (salmon), all in Celsius. At the top of the\noutput screen the user inputs are listed along with the heating and cooling zone area values and a diagram of the type\nof wall section being simulated.\nFigure 12 Heating and\ncooling zone areas\n\nIn order to test a large amount of samples at once and quantitatively compare their thermal efficiencies, the program\nalso outputs a table of heating and cooling zone area values for a set of predefined assemblies (21 different one-layer\nassemblies, 66 two-layer assemblies, and 231 three-layer assemblies). These values are displayed on the table on the\nright side of the input screen (fig. 11).\nFigure 13\nOutput screen, time\nperiod: year\n\n222\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nSonoranSystems: Building Simulation Modeling Using a\nCrassulacean Acid Metabolism Analogy\nFigure 14 Output screen,\ntime period: August\n\n7 Analysis\nThe tabular data can be exported to MS Excel for supplementary analysis of thermal efficiency in relation to the design\nof the wall assembly. For the water-mmc-water wall construction, the location of the water had a greater effect on\nefficiency than the total water content or total thermal mass of the wall (fig. 15).\nThe 10cm water-15cm mmc-35cm water wall assembly does not have the highest thermal mass (60cm water wall\ndoes) nor does it have the lowest thermal conductivity (60cm mmc does). However, simulation results showed that it\nhas the lowest heating and cooling zone area values of all the assemblies tested. Compared to the reference case,\nthe heating zone area was reduced by 19% and the cooling zone area was reduced by 8%, making this assembly, like\nmost others tested, more useful for cooling purposes, which is important for the Sonoran desert. It is the integration of\nthe thermal mass of water and conductivity of mmc that precipitates the most efficient assembly.\nIt is known that thermal mass (water) inside of an insulating layer (mmc) is an effective strategy for thermal control in\ndesert regions. The fact that it was a conclusion of this project both further proves the effectiveness of that strategy and\nsupports the validity of the simulations in this project.\nFor each type of wall assembly 24 hours of data was looked at to observe any diurnal behaviors (or biological\nresemblance) of the system for a typical cold day and hot day.\nThe temperature profiles generated allow for the comparison of the diurnal temperature fluctuation of the indoor space\nand wall to the metabolic functioning of CAM more than existing energy simulation programs. However, the oscillatory\nbehavior of the wall assemblies was minimal (due to thermal mass effects) and thus difficult to compare to the behavior\nof the natural model.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n223\n\nSonoranSystems: Building Simulation Modeling Using a\nCrassulacean Acid Metabolism Analogy\nFigure 15 Assessment\nof heating zone area\nof a water-mmc-water\nwall in relation to the\ndistribution of water and\nmmc: water content in\nouter layer (blue), mmc\ncontent (red), water\ncontent in inner layer\n(green), and heating zone\narea as a percentage of\nthe base case (purple)\n\nTable 1. 2 day analysis of water-mmc-water wall on typical hot day and typical cold day\n\nWater-mmc-water\nHeating\nFebruary 12–13\n\nCooling\nAugust 3–4\n\n224\n\n10cm water (green)- 15cm mmc (orange)35cm water (brown)\n\n10cm water (green)- 15cm mmc (orange)35cm water (brown)\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nSonoranSystems: Building Simulation Modeling Using a\nCrassulacean Acid Metabolism Analogy\nConclusion\nComplexity is an important aspect of natural systems, and the three-layer wall system was the most complex type of\nassembly tested in this project Furthermore, the fact that the water-mmc-water wall has a clear correlation between the\narrangement of the layers and the effectiveness of the wall evokes the spatial conditions of the biological system where\nproximity and specific architecture is a necessary aspect of the chemical system. It is the three-layer wall system in\nwhich efficiency correlates with a certain degree of diurnal temperature oscillation for the entire year.\nThe temperature profiles (and transmissivity profile) make it possible to begin to observe and compare the behavior of\nthe built thermodynamic system in relation to the behavior of the natural model. However, the ability to make quantitative\nanalyses of the natural and built oscillations was not built into the program. The algorithms outlined in Blasius et al.\n(1999) would have provided an important quantitative description of the natural model. However, the numerical methods\nrequired for those calculations were outside the scope of this project. The successful integration of these equations into\nSonoranSystems would allow the program to actually compute the degree of biological resemblance of a given wall\nassembly in terms of quantitative wave-function analyses. Additional validation studies should be made to ascertain the\nresults of this program including construction and testing of a prototype. In addition, improvements (i.e. user interface)\ncould be made to make SonoranSystems useful for others to use. However, this project has shown that it is possible\nto create a software program where the chemical behavior of a biological model can be compared to the subsequent\nbuilding system and its thermodynamic behavior as a method of exploring multi-layer wall systems.\n\nReferences\nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc., Handbook of Fundamentals,\nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc., Atlanta, 2004.\nArutjunjan, R., Markova, T., Halopenen, I., Maksimov, I., Tutunnikov, A., Yanush, O.

The student design work employed technologies similar to those of the precedent examples within\nthe Australian site ravaged by bushfires to consider digitally aided design and social implications. This paper reinforces\nopportunities for designers and technologies.\n\n1 Introduction\nDuring February 2009, Australians awoke daily to new scenes of crisis and terror. Massive firestorms devastated large\nsections of the Victorian landscape, destroying homes and families. Feeling helpless and compassionate, many of us\ndonated much-needed funds to support the rebuilding of the Victorian hinterland. The crises inspired me to explore\nthe ACADIA 2009 conference theme, reForm(): how technologies transform the ways in which buildings and spaces\nperform, act, and operate. As an architect and academic, I am interested in understanding the role architecture can play\nin reForming a society, such as the affected Victorian community, and in how we as architects employ the technology\navailable to us to transform and respond to our shifting environments and confront the social ramifications.\nThe Victorian crisis provided a platform for revisiting the debate concerning environmental shifts and the damage that\nis attributable to human activity. Overpopulation, political conflict, considerable levels of pollution, and depletion of\nnatural resources are arguably hastening the destruction of environmental ecosystems and shifting climatic conditions\n(Gore 2006). While the building industry is a large contributor to environmental damage, architectural designs, both\nspeculative and realized, can demonstrate predictive capabilities to address the environmental issues.\nArchitectural design practices considered in this paper include speculative imagery and mediation through performative\ntechnology in projects that acknowledge the responsibility of design, and the built environment, in tackling environmental\nshifts. The applied research of final-year architectural design students at the University of Sydney explores the precedent\nexamples in art and in architecture. This paper reviews the comparisons to demonstrate opportunities for designers\nand technologies.\n\n2 Crisis\nEach year in Australia, an ecological cycle of destruction and reformation features across news reports. Wet winters\nencourage dense bushland undergrowth, which dries in the warm summer months into a tinderbox. This tinderbox\nexposes the land, and the society living within it, to the threat of fire ignited by lightning strikes or arsonists. Frequently,\n\n226\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nreForming: Responding to Our Land in Crisis\nthese fires cause minor damage to low-density wilderness and farmed hectares. Occasionally, the summation of many\nconflicting environmental conditions contributes to catastrophic firestorms, akin to those experienced this summer.\nOwing to below average rainfalls and hot strong winds, arson-lit fires razed hundreds of thousands of hectares of\nbushland, killing over 200 people across the state of Victoria (Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria 2009). The scale of\ndestruction to homes and families required significant community assistance through fundraising and other support\nsystems. All prime-time television stations covered the extreme devastation (The Daily Telegraph 2009, Herald Sun\n2009).\nThe crisis moved me, as an architectural designer, to investigate reformation options in sites prone to extreme\nenvironments, and to instigate a dialogue regarding our role as architects within the responding design community:\nwhat are the architectural opportunities within contemporary digital software for transforming the ways in which the\narchitectural discipline can address change and devastation? The first avenue I investigated was the role of imagery in\nspeculating architectural futures.\n\n3 Speculative Imagery and the artwork of Giacomo Costa\nI In a recent journal article, Greg Lynn suggested that “architects still pursuing the idea of generating buildings, rather\nthan designing them, are merely seeking a spurious mystification of the art of architecture” (Lynn in Lally and Young\n2007:66). This comment underscores the fear that exists within contemporary design dialogue that architectural design\nwill fall victim to focusing too heavily on surface appearance and mimetic imagery resulting in overly simplified and\nrationalized architectural content (Benton 2008;101–102). Overt emphasis on form and the visuality of contemporary\narchitectural production catalyzes fears that architectural design will be thought of as simply being pretty pictures,\nsacrificing a cohesive design (Gusheh 2004:46; Bilak 1998; Baker 1998:79). By implication, this fear of dwelling on\nthe output of digital media in architectural design, in particular, its imagery, is alien to the values of selflessness and\nsocial responsibilities of architectural design practice. Moreover, dwelling on the output can result in minimal critical\nengagement and, thereby, lead to trivial and superficial architectural propositions (Allen 2000:xv).\nHowever, an architect needs to understand that there is considerable communicative power within an image. The power\nis inherent in the understanding that the image is never a neutral tool or a mere mimetic picture of a building (PerezGomez 1997:7). Since the inception of Western architecture, the architect has not “made” the buildings but rather has\nmade the mediating artifacts that communicate the buildings (Perez-Gomez 1997:7). In contemporary design and our\nimage-led culture, the visual is a dominating aspect, and digital technology has largely driven it. The image has acquired\na pragmatic role that has meant, for the most part, that computer graphic applications in architectural design are still\nlittle more than an efficient “mechanism of composition” due particularly to “seductive manipulations of viewpoints and\ndelusions of three-dimensionality” (Perez-Gomez 1997:377). And while they make the “objectification of ‘another’ reality\nappear more intense,” their use has arguably “not improved the quality of our environment” (Perez-Gomez 1997:377).\nAs a tool of representation, digitally mediated imagery can be harbored for a “theoretical potential for heading toward\neither absolute fluidity or further fixation and reduction” (Perez-Gomez 1997:378). This notion follows a tradition of\npractice begun by architectural artists such as Piranesi, Legeay, Boullee, and Ledoux (Perez-Gomez 1997:378), and\ncontinued more recently by Lebbeuz Woods, whose buildings “only exist on paper [with a] mastery of gesture and reality\nin drawing, making the viewer believe that the unlikely is likely” (Cook in Bingham 2004:25). With digital techniques, as\nCook suggests, this tradition may continue the “ability to explore different, surprising dimensionalities, in a fluid medium\nwhere collage and monstrosity are almost natural, could hold great promise for architectural practice” (Cook in Bingham\n2004:25). As Cook notes, “engaging time in visual experience, the ephemeral architecture, constructed in cyberspace,\ncould conceivably function as a site for imagery and reverie” (Cook in Bingham 2004:25).\nFollowing the views of Walter Benjamin, the digitally mediated image presents a platform to “fantasize” and to\n“explore” (Benjamin 1992:218). Giacomo Costa, a Florentine photographer, uses imagery to demonstrate the\npower of speculation. He fuses photography and digital techniques to create fantastical futuristic cityscape imagery.\nAmorphous megastructures, which are free of both occupation and upkeep, punctuate deteriorating monotonous\ncityscapes (fig. 1).\nCosta lets his works speak for themselves. He respectfully allows the viewers to form their own interpretations of\nthe works. Within the publication, Giacomo Costa: The Chronicles of Time, the editor clarifies that Costa employs\n“Hollywood blockbuster style digital techniques [to] reshape our collective idea of the metropolis through fantastic\ncityscapes straight out of science fiction” (Costa 2009). The work merges natural or human-induced catastrophe\nthrough intricately detailed imagery, recalling both the fictional work, “the world without us,” a speculative nonfiction that\nconsiders what our planet would be like without human presence (Weisman 2007), and “classical Florentine architect\nAntonio di Pietro Averlino’s ideal city, Sforzinda” (Costa 2009).\nAs Costa’s imagery suggests, designers need to progress from the view of the digitally mediated image as a superficial\nor merely pragmatic tool in architectural designing and reinstate its role in communicating speculative futures. The\ndesigner needs to continue to consider how imagery is orchestrated as an illustration, in any medium, in ways that allow\nthe imagination to roam and that show the viewer the unexpected (Bingham 2004:12).\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n227\n\nreForming: Responding to Our Land in Crisis\nFigure 1 Giacomo\nCosta ATT0 N.3 2006,\nATT0 N.10 2007,\nPERSISTENZA N.2 2008\n(Cropped images, full\nplates in Costa 2009).\n\n4 Performance technology and the architectural design\nof Greg Lynn\nTo arrive at speculative imagery, a designer considers external and internal factors (Cuff 1991:72–84), such as ideology,\nchosen media, and site variables. In observing the final speculative imagery, a viewer is often unaware of the unspoken\nlogic: the dialogue shared between the designer, the influencing factors, and the organizing principles arranged in software\ntechnologies. Digital performative technologies may assist how designers derive and control logic.\nGreg Lynn describes this approach as a “performance envelope” (Lynn 1999:13), which exploits environmental influences\nin order to reform architecture and its possible futures. The performance envelope identifies “expressions,” which are\n“statements that define the size, position, rotation, direction or speed of an object” (Lynn 1999:14), and statements\nregarding relationships, which inform how an object may gain characteristics from adjacent objects or forces, namely\n“multiple independent interacting variables [that] can be linked to influence one another through logical expressions” (Lynn\n1999:14). The result is a framework from which a series of possibilities or “instances” may be derived (Lynn 1999:14).\n\n228\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nreForming: Responding to Our Land in Crisis\nLynn uses this design approach as a way of highlighting the challenge facing contemporary architecture: to “understand the\nappearance of these tools in a more sophisticated way than as simply a new set of shapes” (Lynn 1999:14). Lynn suggests\nthat designers need to consider how to engage issues of time and motion in design, and the conceptual and organizational\nfacilities within computation alongside issues of aesthetics and materiality (Lynn 1999:19).\nFigure 2 Greg Lynn SIM\nResidence\n(Lally 2007)\n\nFigure 3 Greg Lynn\nSIM Residence\nExploring Design\nthrough Performance\nTechnology (Lally 2007)\n\nLynn’s SIM Residence demonstrates\nthe concept of the “performative\nenvelope,” as Lally calls it (fig. 2).\nWhile the final proposition is rigid in\nform, its underlying logic is dynamic\nand responsive to occupation\nand the landscape surrounding\nit. The building is “imbued with\nperformative variation derived from\nmultiple scenarios of living...as a\nmethod to develop configurations\nthat,\nwhile\ndormant,\nexist\nsimultaneously within the form until\nactivated” (Lally 2007:27). The form,\nspace, and territories of the SIM\nResidence parametrically adjust\nand are analyzed with performance\ntechnology.\nThe\ndesign\nis,\nconceptually, a built ecology\nbetween form, air, and temperature\nperformance derived through digital\ntechniques (Lally 2007:27).\nConsidering Lynn’s project reinforces the notion that performative digital design technologies can contribute to the\nunderstanding of environmental influences on a form. Through these dynamic technologies, designers can explore\nrepresentations of forces to inform their design’s geometry and surface. Simulation aids this exploration, which can take\ninto consideration broader ecosystems and interconnected variables (Lally 2007:25).\n\n5 Applied research: speculation and mediation explored at\nThe University of Sydney\nTaking lead from the project examples, and from other university education programs such as the Architectural\nAssociation’s Extreme Environment studio and Environmental Tectonics studio (Hardy 2008), masters students at the\nUniversity of Sydney used the aforementioned techniques, reconsideration of imagery in speculating architectural\nfutures, and the exploitation of performative technologies in informing the underlying logics of design as a framework\nfor applied design research. The Victorian crisis was given as the context, and the students were asked to design new\nlodgings for the fire-affected area.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n229\n\nreForming: Responding to Our Land in Crisis\nStudents identified key conceptual influences impacting their design and employed parametric models and scripts to\ncreate formal responses. The designs progressed by considering the context of site and reconsidering the techniques\nemployed. Through their iterative reassessment of concept, technique, context, and performative quality, architectural\npropositions emerged and were refined. Following are three student projects; reviewed in terms of parametric\nframeworks, imagery, and their contribution toward the dialogue regarding the crises context.\n\n5.1 Specific parametric frameworks\nThe first project used a control spline and a number of points of change to establish an overarching gestural layout across\nthe site. Along this spline, the students configured a series of lengths and widths to determine unit types and positions.\nThe second project used a grasshopper script to organize a deformable triangular form along a defining spline. The\narrangement was then tested and applied across several terrain typologies. The students then developed one selected\ntypology to a higher architectural resolution.\nFigure 4 Design\nStudies Completed\nby Andrew Daly,\nUniversity of Sydney,\nMaster of Architecture\nStudent, 2009\n\nThe third project defined three differing spatial areas for a mixed-use development: housing, work, and play. The\nstudents then filtered these spaces through the remaining trees and Victorian site ruins and elevated them by an\namorphous nurbs surface stretched across the spaces. To refine this surface, the students identified key control lines\nand cross sections, which they then used to develop the details of the building, including a water sprinkling system as\na first line of defense.\n\n230\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nreForming: Responding to Our Land in Crisis\n\nThese students also developed a series of images of their design that visually expressed their project within the ruined\nsite of Victoria. Their proposed building was designed to be destroyed in the reoccurring firestorms. While the students\narticulated the parametric logics in accompanying panels, the moody montages intertwined the new building form with\nthe decimated context of the fire-affected area, resulting in a series of images that conveyed a haunting speculation.\n\nFigure 5 Design Studies\nCompleted by Ian Gibson\nand Amelia Parkins,\nUniversity of Sydney,\nMaster of Architecture\nStudents, 2009\n\nFigure 6 Design\nStudies Completed by\nDavid Bonouvrie and\nKatherine Harrison,\nUniversity of Sydney,\nMaster of Architecture\nStudents, 2009\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n231\n\nreForming: Responding to Our Land in Crisis\n\n5.2 Project Summation\nWhile each project evolved differently, directed largely by the initial conceptual framework developed by the individual\nstudents, the clarification of set out control points, organization, and relationships of the design formally assisted each\nproject. Explicating these design items into simplified diagrammatic schemas (similar to fig. 6) provided a basis for the\nreview panel to evaluate and understand the formal geometries. Further explication of these forms, to their adjacent\ncontexts, evolved by way of the students making physical models and sketches. In reviewing the students’ work, it was\napparent that only a formal level of information was informing the digital parametric models, and the design schemas\nthemselves. The review panel suggested additional time, a refined brief, and a clearer set of design drivers; for example,\nenvironmental, structural, and programmatic should be clarified in future studio briefs to enable a more developed model.\nWhile I would have liked to see the student work extend beyond the projects of Lynn or Costa, I discovered that the\nstudents found no significant variations to these established modes of operation. This was likely due to the limited skill set\nof the students and the conflicting technological and poetic aims of my studio framework. The studio work as a whole\nresulted in a battle between poetic gestures and rigorous dimensional constraints (similar to fig. 5).\n\nFigure 7 Design\nStudies Completed by\nDavid Bonouvrie and\nKatherine Harrison,\nUniversity of Sydney,\nMaster of Architecture\nStudents, 2009\n\nHowever, the exercise did address our need to introduce the students to parametric techniques, and the students\ndeveloped a number of design applications for this technology in the studio. Through the exercise, I became aware that\ndeveloping parametric models could contribute to geometric manipulation, but if the skill base of the designer is low,\nthere can be a tendency to disregard other influences on the design, which could also feed into the parametric model, for\nexample, environmental conditions such as sun movement. The more successful projects saw students working together,\nor combatively, to ensure that the pragmatics and the technique balanced with the poetics and the social agenda.\nAs with Costa’s imagery, the gestural, poetic, and conceptual visualizations aided the students in conveying poetic\narchitectural narratives. Their speculative imagery attempted to portray reformations for the society. Within these\nrepresentations, the computational techniques were relegated to unspoken logic or a dialogue shared between the\ndesigner and the material (be that digital or analogue) in the process of developing the design. In the final visual work,\nissues of composition, organization, and relationship were curated and conveyed through digital imagery and used to\nreinforce powerful visual messages regarding the architectural design, the environmental context, and humankind (similar\nto fig. 7). In this sense, the studio was productive in verifying the importance of articulating an architectural “narrative” in the\nearly stages of design, and this outcome suggests an area for further research.\nIn terms of the context, the crisis provided a challenging and engaging framework. It provided stimulus for the exploration\nof the digital techniques and introduced students to disaster-orientated design. The exercise offered a more “real” practice\nproblem and led to the development of a series of proposals for the Victorian hinterland in terms of how we may be able\nto begin reforming that part of our world. The context further provided a stimulating learning experience for the students,\nand while we may not have addressed all of the influences, or any of these in great depth in this single project, as Hardy\nsuggests, we still need to design for the conditions of the near future (Hardy 2008:17). If nothing else, this project served\nas a reminder that our environment is informed by and can inform the digital design processes that we may employ as\narchitectural designers. While techniques can be fascinating parts of daily practice, larger contextual issues can arise\nto shock architectural designers into also engaging in the reality of social crisis. If the projected shifting environmental\necosystems and climatic conditions (Gore 2006) unravel, the capacity to address these concerns in a dynamic manner\ncould become more necessary. This, again, suggests an area for further studio examination.\n\nConclusions\nWithin the context of the 2009 Victorian bushfire environmental and social crisis, I was inspired to contemplate the\narchitectural opportunities within contemporary digital software for transforming the ways in which the architectural\ndiscipline can address change and devastation. The investigation identified possibilities in imagery and performative\ntechnologies in speculating and developing architectural reFormation.\nThe role of imagery in signifying projective futures and presenting speculations to inspire society was discussed. The\nhistory of visionary architectural imagery is long, and through the integration of digital techniques, imagery allowing\n\n232\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nreForming: Responding to Our Land in Crisis\nthe imagination to roam and showing the viewer the unexpected may be an area for development. Advancing digital\nsimulation and visualization technologies offer a platform to develop fantastic visions, as demonstrated through the\nartwork of Giacomo Costa. While this is a static end-product example, movement and transformation techniques can\nfurther extend how designers re-vision new tomorrows. As demonstrated in Greg Lynn’s design, dynamic performative\nor parametric media can be employed to not only re-vision form, but also to develop and control how a designer reshapes form to respond to environmental issues.\nApplied research at The University of Sydney explored performative digital media and imagery. The university-based\nproject work provided a few insights into applying the techniques into design. While we may not have made significant\nadvancements to the application of the tools in the design, we were able to demonstrate to students their potential in\ninforming their designs and how a stimulating contextual problem can provide an inspiring learning experience.\nWhile meteorologists, politicians, and citizens have seemingly limited control over the unpredictability of shifting and\nextreme environmental conditions, architects do have the potential to employ and control technologies operatively in\nthe ‘definition and qualification of the territories we construct and inhabit’ (Lally 2007:32). Although the natural world\nwe live in is somewhat uncontrollable and ever-changing, the projects presented in this paper discuss a number of\nways in which an architect can begin to contribute productively to reformation. These include speculative imagery and\nperformative technologies.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe University of Sydney Master of Architecture Digital Research Stream Semester 1\n2009 Students and Design Tutors, including Dirk Anderson (Urban Futures Organisation\nSydney), Damien Butler (Damien Butler Design) and Willea Ferris (a+u studio)\nImages of copyright work by Giacomo Costa and Greg Lynn have been reproduced from publications noted.\n\nReferences\nAllen, S.

Sustainable power generation, water management, ecological infrastructures, and other nascent\nenviro-tech applications require negotiations between digital technologies and analog systems. This paper explores\nthe model of abstraction languages as a method to create communications between biological and mechanical\nsystems, focusing on modes accessible to design professionals.\nDeveloping a mediating language based on abstraction creates an approach that addresses simultaneous issues\nin enviro-tech interfaces for sensing, responsiveness, automation, and interactivity. This language exists in a\nliminal realm between mechanical or digital devices and biological or ecological systems. Abstraction addresses\nsimultaneous modes of complexity through a common dialogue. This comes in multiple forms, from a library for\ndesign to a logical interface between chaotic components. This lends itself to the development of methods of\nabstraction, taking infinitely complex organisms and finding threads to abstract information meaningfully.\nThe development of data and control abstraction in programming is explored in order to develop linkages between\nphysical systems and digital interfaces. This examination looks at current methods of data conveyance for the built\nenvironment, and at pushing beyond these current methods to suggest a method of abstraction. The researchers\nare particularly interested in the ability of abstraction to compress ecological/biological complexity into accessible\nmodules for responsive environments. These modules would be developed to create evolving systems to control,\nmodify, link, or interpret ecologies, biologies, cultures, and societies.\n\n1 Introduction\nAn increasing attention to sustainability and design vernacular coupled with the availability of new technologies that\nenable evaluation, efficiency, and adaptability challenges designers to establish meaningful connections between\nthe built environment and users. Sustainable power generation, water management, ecological infrastructures, and\nother nascent enviro-tech applications already require negotiations between digital and analog systems; however,\nthese negotiations are often insulated from design, inaccessible to designers without specific scientific knowledge\nor technical skill in electrical or computer engineering. Our environment is saturated with “smart” devices that we\nuse every day. Many of these devices are embedded into our lives in such a manner that we hardly know they exist,\nfunctioning in the periphery and blending into the context of our environment (McCullough 2005). As designers\nof the built environment, we have the responsibility to engage site context and, therefore, take into account this\nlayer of technology, which is increasingly affecting the environment. The need to establish a methodology for\ncommunicating between technological, environmental, biological, cultural, and social systems becomes apparent.\nIn this paper, we propose that by examining high-order computing principles and borrowing from the concept of\nabstraction layers in order to compress complexity, modules for responsive environments that are accessible to\ndesigners can be developed to control, modify, link, and interpret ecologies.\n\n234\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nAbstraction Language: Digital/Analog Dialogues\n2 Abstraction\nIn many cases, collected data is filtered, reduced, and refined in order to become manageable. When data is\ndiminished in this way, valuable pieces of context can be lost. Abstraction, however, separates essential elements from\ncomplexity in order to analyze or classify the properties without losing data fidelity. Disparate systems can be arranged\nand compared when characteristics are separated or details of one or more properties are hidden, allowing one to\nconcentrate on different concepts in isolation from others (Dale and Weems 2007). In computer architecture, there is a\nseries of abstraction layers that operate between the physical hardware and the software that runs the hardware. These\nlayers hide the implementation details and differences between hardware so that they can function within the same\nsystem. Libraries translate commands provided by the programs into the specific device commands needed by each\nindividual piece of hardware. While unessential details are hidden, they are not lost and can be retrieved in the event of\nlater necessity. Abstraction makes it possible to change the quantity of information represented, allowing a reformulation\nin a simpler formalism to become possible, while preserving the quantity of information involved (Giunchiglia and Walsh\n1992; Zucker 2003).\nThere are two types of abstraction: control and data. Control (process or procedural) abstraction separates the way\na procedure or action is used from how it is implemented, and focuses on actions. Subprograms and control flows\nsimulate desired concepts or interactions. Structured programming breaks down complex tasks into many different\nmodules and isolates the implementation details of one component from the others (Dale and Weems 2007). The\nexternal representation is the presentation or interaction that allows programmers to intuitively communicate with\nhardware. Without a form of control abstraction, the process of communicating directly with hardware lacks flexibility, is\nnot efficient, and lacks the intuition of abstract arithmetic operations.\nData abstraction separates the elements of behavior that are not critical to the procedure from those that are, and\nallows programmers to hide data representation details behind a simple set of operations (Dale and Weems 2007).\nThis creates a contract on behavior between data and code. Anything that is poorly defined or not defined when\nimplemented can change, thus, breaking the system. Both types of abstraction can be used discretely or jointly,\ndepending upon the requirements of the system.\nA system that focuses on defined methods of abstraction must provide methods for separating qualities of each\ncomponent and classifying those that are similar, creating moments of overlap and possibilities for communication.\nThe merging of disparate systems such as ecology, technology, and culture requires abstraction methods that link\neach system, preserving desirable properties while allowing complex disparities to be hidden. Abstraction must provide\na system that expands the boundaries of programmed systems, which are currently built for specific interactions\nand which lack the opportunity to create evolving organic interactions. Creating a system that expresses intricate\ncomplexities is typically an issue of maintaining high-data fidelity and temporal accessibility.\n\n3 Systems and Communication\nCommunication between disparate systems requires the development of a mediating language that can address\nsimultaneous modes of complexity through a common dialogue. Contrasting ambient local systems creates context\nand gives meaning to places, shaping how we use and associate with others in that place. Ecological-biological\nsystems consist of physical structures and living systems, functional processes, ecological mechanisms, and the\nhierarchical arrangement of these communities. Evolution, interaction, behavior, and development occur within these\nsystems and create communities within which we can monitor water quality, commodity production, environmental\nproblems, and energy production. Social-cultural systems correspond to institutions, organizations, entities, or groups\nin relation to each other and patterns of behavior. They are based on ideology, knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, values,\ngoals, practices, experience, history, and courses of action. Technological systems negotiate between these, in many\ncases imperceptibly, and consist of the use and knowledge of tools, methods of organization, techniques, skills,\nprocesses, adaptation, and control of the environment.\nDialogue and conversation occur when these systems exchange information in a continuous process, acknowledging\nand/or influencing each other’s responses, creating a progression of feedback loops. These loops can be either single\n(closed) or multiple (open). In a single-loop conversation, outputs are determined by filtering, and the system feeds\ninformation back into itself. In multiple-loop conversation, new information from each system influences future dialogue\nand depends upon cycles of response (Haque 2006; Dubberly and Haque and Pangaro 2009). In a true multiple-loop\nscenario, the output is not predetermined but is predicated on the context that continually changes in response to\nthe systems, and expresses the complexity within that environment. By focusing on context, designers can be more\nequipped to accommodate different and flexible relationships.\nThe multiple-loop scenario can be extrapolated to an under-specified or evolving system, ordering a new set of\npossibilities. Instruction is embedded in each device, architecture, or infrastructure, allowing for rich interactions with the\nenvironment and the adjacent systems. Systems coagulate and disperse, looking for contextual stability; the underlying\nframework is in flux with shifting priorities and goals. (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3)\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n235\n\nAbstraction Language: Digital/Analog Dialogues\nFigure 1 First order\nloop, singular interaction\nthrough temporal field\n\nFigure 2 Second order\nloop, multiple interactions through predefined\nrelationships\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nAbstraction Language: Digital/Analog Dialogues\nFigure 3\nEvolving dialogue,\ninteraction fields occur\nwith multiple overlaps\nwithin incongruent temporal relationships\n\n4 Current Scenarios\nDialogue creation and theories of communication between biological and mechanical systems emerged as soon\nas the foundations of technology appeared. Systems theory was followed by cybernetics, aiming to understand\nthe functions and processes of systems that participate in circular and causal chains that move from action to\nsensing to comparison to action again, especially between artificial and biological systems (Pask 1972). The\ninvestigation between biological and mechanical systems intersects a variety of disciplines, including psychology,\necology, linguistics, anthropology, and visual arts.\nJust as theories span disciplines, current interface and interaction scenarios range from the most commonplace\nto the very fantastic. Environmental monitors control temperature, detect changes in environment quality, and\ngather scientific data. We have become accustomed to light and motion detectors, thermostats, and smoke\nalarms. Interest in virtual spaces has given us immersive displays. More recently, the use of GPS has become\nincreasingly pervasive.\nNot yet quite hidden in the periphery, designers, architects, and artists challenge the notion of static structures\nand passive objects. Smart, responsive spaces and reactive objects populate the growing discipline of interaction\ndesign. Projects such as Aleph by Begnt Sjolen and Adam Somlai-Fischer and the reactive facade at the Zeil\nGallery in Frankfurt gather data and visualize changes in the environment. Bubbles by Fox, Franklin, and Kilian\nand Tulipomania by Invivia sense and reconfigure to user or environmental presence. These projects represent\nreactive, single-loop communications where one system influences another, yet the changes are merely a\ncomplex set of prescribed outcomes. Abundance by Camille Utterback and Deep Walls by Scott Snibbe record\nuser movement and loop the movements back into the context. The exchange affects both systems yet does not\nchange the intent of either system. In essence, there is communication but the dialogue is static. These projects\nfeign complexity by allowing variation, yet the outcomes are not shaped by process. Haque Design + Research\nis currently exploring dynamic, responsive, and conversant architecture and multiple projects that also explore\noperating systems and programming languages as methods for designers to follow. (Open) Burble and Sky Ear\nboth use helium balloons, sensors, and networking to allow the environment and participants to control and\nreconfigure the structures (Bullivant 2005). Both ecological and social systems are influencing the structure. The\nsocial system is influencing the ecological by activating the sensors, but the ecological does not change its intent.\nMoving toward more process-driven applications, another project of Haque Design + Research, “Siphonophora”\nconsists of devices that monitor context, both ecological and social. As the context changes, the devices react\nin unanticipated, unscripted behavior.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n237\n\nAbstraction Language: Digital/Analog Dialogues\nIn all of these scenarios, technology takes the form of an object mediating between systems. The emphasis on object\ninstead of context or environment reduces the complexity of each system and loses fluid connections, varying conditions\nand processes that can emerge in a higher order, multiple-loop, or evolving dialogue. Stan Allen formerly advocated this\nposition, suggesting that architecture shift focus from object to field conditions and address the form between things\ninstead the form of things (Allen 1997). As we design the built environment, addressing the need to control, modify, and\ninterpret ecologies in an effort to enable sustainability and adaptability, we need to be able to compress and exploit the\nintricacy of context in order to create connections between ecological and social systems.\n\n5 Abstraction Methodology\nTo understand how abstraction may affect the interrelation between systems it is necessary to discuss a variety\nof modes of reaction/interaction including sensing, storage, communication, analysis, learning, mechanics, and\nvisualization. Each mode has unique properties, but a similarity must be considered in order to maintain data fidelity and\nflexibility when abstracted. Each of these aforementioned systems can be categorized as input, processing, or output,\ncreating a component of a larger inter/reactive system. Inputs are typically sensing systems gathering data from the\nenvironment, but they can also come from storage or database systems depending on the implementation. Processing\nsystems are analytical or transformative in nature, causing data to take on new forms. Output systems are varied but\nare typically either physical/mechanical or sensorial visualization systems. What does it mean to abstract any of these\nsystems? Can we envision a robust methodology of abstraction that intends to maintain accessibility while promoting\nan underlying complexity? How does the composite of the systems form a responsive framework that allows for free\nevolution while maintaining stability?\n\n5.1 Input\nInput provides a stream of data, updating in real time or read from a stored location, typically starting the cycle of sense,\nprocess, and output. It should be noted that, based on the aforementioned discussion of conversation, this cycle may\ncontinually update or inform its own output, creating an evolving relationship.\nTypically, sensing methods are direct interfaces between environmental phenomena and explicit binary data. Sensing\nis accomplished through a range of technologies created with specific purposes, for example, image, orientation, or\ntemperature recording. The specific purpose for which the device was designed is often expanded through clever\nmodifications to either sensing ranges or application in the environment. An example might be a low-resolution video\ncamera that typically captures images, but which may be used to sense movement or change through an analysis of\nthe pixels between frames, expanding the sensing capabilities through a small tweak in the processing of the input.\nThis versatility is a product of clever modifications to the input/processing relationship, but it is not part of a robustly\ndesigned framework for rich environmental systems.\nFor brevity, this discussion will forgo storage systems, as the relationship between ecological, biological, cultural,\nor social phenomena and input (sensing) technologies is the real concern. The sensing of each phenomenon must\nmaintain data fidelity across time, location, and content (level). In each instance, these are the recordings that can be\nabstracted with direct relationships to human or environmental interactions. Through ecological, biological, cultural, or\nsocial phenomena, time and location form a basis that allows for meta-relationships to form across systems. For inputs\n(sensing), it could be concluded that content, location, and time are the abstraction points necessary to maintain a link\nbetween ephemeral data and the built environment. Each input type would then have a range of levels for sensed data,\nsuch as temperature, and an associated location and time, allowing data to be accessed based on these properties,\nmasking underlying complexities.\n\n5.2 Processing\nProcessing provides the greatest range of possibilities for abstraction between data and systems. Typically, this\ncreates opportunities for analysis or the transformation of data such as comparisons between moments in time or\ntranslations from one mode to another (i.e., temperature to location of objects in space [infrared]). In most instances, this\ntransformation or analysis tends to flatten the dataset and reform it for a specific, pre-defined purpose. In the examples\nmentioned above, interaction may have been high, but the system’s framework is one dimensional, creating a defined\nexpression of outcomes.\nProcessing must also be based around the same abstraction model where data complexity is funneled through\ncontent, location, and time. When information is processed, whether through analysis or transformation, each bit of\ninformation is abstracted through the previously outlined physical attributes. This mode of abstraction allows data to be\naccessed at any point during processing, with specific properties used to develop larger-scale contextual relationships.\nIf we assume that processing would occur through control abstraction, similar to sensing, we must also conceive of\na fourth point, translation. Translation refers to the transfer of information between disparate systems, and it must be\naccomplished through a singular model based on data abstraction. This model would create consistency across data,\nas it is transferred between disparate systems.\n\n238\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nAbstraction Language: Digital/Analog Dialogues\n5.3 Output\nOutput is often the most tangible mode of the sensing, processing, and visualizing stream. This may occur in many\nforms, such as in the creation of imagery, morphological changes to forms, or the automation of systems. The tangible\nnature of outputs creates a moment that guides or alters interaction, creating perceivable changes in the environment.\nBecause of the physical nature of output, time and location are the critical abstraction points, with context becoming an\nunderlying factor in the equation. While output can also be embedded within the processing stream in order to create\nmultiple transformations, in this discussion, it will be overlooked for the sake of simplicity.\nAs the output drives a visualization or change in form, location and time data are used to access underlying system\ncomplexity and to relate change back to the larger system. By contextualizing output based on time and location, we\ncreate a method to relate the moment of system and human interaction back to sensing and processing moments in\nthe same or disparate systems. These output systems may be one-to-one visualizations or large-scale infrastructures\nfor power generation.\n\nSynthesis/Conclusion\nSystems that find common modes of abstraction begin to create opportunities for larger interrelationships between\ndisparate ecological, biological, social, and cultural modes. This common layer of abstraction creates an overarching\nopportunity to create, analyze, or accentuate patterns of linkages, replacing the design of self-contained devices or\narchitectures. Each element expresses itself through physical data and with underlying streams of complexity that stem\nfrom local inputs but are linked and modified within larger systems. The larger system has no aim of control but, instead,\ntrends toward local stabilities and adaptation and modification across subsets of systems.\nA system or infrastructure based on mutual abstraction would be contextually aware through local interactions, such as\nthrough responsive buildings, traffic monitoring, and/or environmental sensors. The system would have predetermined\ngoals of safety but evolving goals of management linked across time, location, and content. Creating a contextual\nnarrative relayed through abstraction allows for a multitude of designers to develop robust local systems that are\ninherently interconnected. Most importantly, this interconnected system does not ignore the value of local context but,\ninstead, exemplifies it and expands its relationships, creating potentials for rich human experience.\n\nReferences\nAllen, Stan.

It first contextualizes research in architectural practice and tries to propose an explanation\nfor the difficulties in implementing it; then explains the evolution of the groups’ computing approach from bespoke to\nheuristic sets of lightweight applications. It concludes with examples of the developed computational design approach.\n\n1 Research within architectural practice\n1.1 Historical Background\nThe origins of the systematic integration of experimental approaches in architectural practice can be found in the\nformation stages of modern architecture. It was at the end of the nineteenth century that the industrial research lab\nfirst took shape in places such as Thomas Alba Edison’s Menlo Park, where Edison applied the principles of mass\nproduction to the process of invention (Friedrich Kittler 2002). The avant-gardes of the early twentieth century, in their\neffort to address the aesthetic, social, and new production forms of industrialism, integrated many aspects of the\nresearch lab into their practices. The Bauhaus or the Constructivist Vkhutemas can be seen, in this light, as research\nlabs, functioning under similar principles as their industrial counterparts but with an agenda of aesthetic and social\ninnovation rather than pure technological development. (Kenneth Frampton 1990).\nThe introduction of systematic experimentation to architecture remained, for the most part, limited to plastic research\nand bound to academia. Despite the importance of technological innovation in the modernist discourse, the economic\ndifference of means of production between industry and architecture prevented the implementation of in-depth\nresearch in standard architectural practice, and limited its application to experimental architecture. Whereas research\nis substantial to most industries, architecture remains, in this sense, a conservative discipline that is strongly linked to a\ntraditional form of production, that is, the tradition originated in the Renaissance of drawn representations.\n\n1.2 Research and economic context\nIn An Evolutionary Architecture (1995), John Frazer pointed out how architecture’s form of production remains labor\nintensive rather than capital intensive (John Frazer 1995). Even without factoring in the construction or fabrication process\nitself, the development of an industrial product and a building differ substantially simply in the number of times the design\nwill be reproduced. Architecture’s products are, in most cases, singular (buildings), whereas in industry, a single design will\nbe reproduced as many times as the market demands, often using largely automated processes. This obvious difference\nis essential in distinguishing the possibilities of the forms of research in architecture and industrial production. First, in an\narchitectural design process, the demarcation between design, research, and production (construction) is unclear, and to\nidentify the specific effects of investment on a particular part of the process, although still possible, become more difficult\nand, thus, harder to argue for. Second, the one-off character of buildings and the diversity of tasks and situations they\nmay respond to (in terms of function, location, size, construction types) make research difficult to implement, if compared\nwith industrial products. The areas architectural production where it is possible to argue for research are those involving\nindustrial production, such as prefabrication or, more recently, numerically controlled fabrication.\n\n242\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nAedas R&D:\nGlobal Practices of Computational Design\nAlternatively, in the labor-intensive architectural process, what is “reproduced” are the skills of the designers and the\nprocesses they use, and it is, perhaps, in regard to these that research can also take place.\nThe emergence of global practices and, in general, of large architectural firms, together with the ubiquity of digital\ntechnology, challenges this situation. Large firms invest in research to create a “competitive edge” by building digital\nknow-how in the form of custom software, such as Gehry Technologies’ Digital Project, or custom digital workflows.\n\n2 Computational Design Development Strategies\n2.1 Transition\nWhen we started out in 2004, we employed an “academic” approach to computational design, trying to implement\ncomputational heuristics that could create wholly novel workflows, often covering many design stages. While this\ntends to create bulky one-off programs with complicated interfaces that are hard to re-deploy and impossible to\nintegrate with a non-computational architectural workflow, it allowed us to gauge the differences between traditional\nand computational heuristics.\n\nFigure 1\nWidgets for Access and\nMovement Design\n\nAs a direct result, we abandoned computational heuristics for some time and attempted two routes: building general\nutility programs for recurrent design situations and solving bespoke [custom-made?] design aspects like facades or\nmathematical shapes. Consequently, computation became more integrated into the architectural workflow as the risk\nof development asymmetry had been eliminated. Computing simply “replaced” or automated a stage of design rather\nthan offering creative alternative processes or inputs through research.\n\n2.2 Widget Assemblies\nCompiling generic applications for recurrent design situations led us to collect small applications—widgets—with\ndistinct, limited scope. The widgets’ flexibility—supported by the use of Java and OpenGL—offers a modularity that\nallows for fast and easy assembly of algorithms into different workflows. Additionally, the creation of widgets promotes\nshort development cycles and breaks the computational design workflow into short iterations, where several group\nmembers can develop versions simultaneously. While not pursuing an explicit methodology, this lightweight, shortcycle approach is reminiscent of the software development paradigm called Agile or Adaptive Development (James\nHighsmith 2000). Adaptive Development also draws from systems theory and distributed representation, where\nredundancy allows for adaptation and a component’s defect is absorbed by alternatives, and is diagonally opposed to\nmany current developments of large applications with unlimited scope.\nThis open framework of applications produces many hybrid architectural computation workflows, where the designers\nand code form an adaptive whole. Real-time simulation and interactivity foster a conversation as envisioned by\nNegroponte, who hoped for an “evolutionary dialogue” between user and machine (Nicolas Negroponte 1970).\n\nFigure 2\nWidgets for\nVisibility Analysis and\nVisual Formation\n\n2.3 Meta-Heuristic Design Computation\nAs the risk associated with workflow integration has diminished and widget assemblies afforded new architectural\nheuristics, the CDR group managed to re-introduce computational heuristics, such as evolutionary, annealing, or antcolony search algorithms that were tested outside workflows in the early years. The modularity and limitation of scope\nof our widgets represent an ideal framework for the explicit encoding of otherwise implicit qualities and processes—key\nperformance indicators—of a designer’s rules of thumb and assumptions. Search and combinatorial algorithms can\napproximate good solutions for design situations with complex tasks but clear targets. The simplicity and real-time\naspects of our simulations produce transparent results and empathy, encouraging their use. The synthesis between\nsubjective architectural heuristics and search algorithms results in ever-novel meta-heuristic design computations like\nNegroponte’s “evolutionary dialogue,” forming new commercial workflows through research in large firms like Aedas.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n243\n\nAedas R&D:\nGlobal Practices of Computational Design\n\nConclusion\nThe CDR group has collaborated with many partners, from urban designers and planners, to developers and architects,\nto interior and furniture designers, who lent us their “implicit knowledge,” design drivers, and assumptions. Figures 1\nthrough 3 show five widgets from larger collections used for Digital Masterplanning and Architecture. Figure 4 shows\nseveral applications built simultaneously through agile development for a specific design brief.\n\nFigure 3 Widgets for\nLand-Use Mix, Density\nand Massing Generation\n\nLarge architectural practices have returned to conduct research in the interest of the industry and, thus, have turned\nthemselves into public research agencies like Menlo Park was over a hundred years ago.\n\nReferences\nFrazer, J.

Current systems for the automated support of ownerdriven configuration management are limited with regard to the degree of freedom they offer to end-users, due to\nthe lack of an easy way to specify those freedoms. In this paper we present the prototype of an interface that allows\narchitects to define constraints to which user-customized dwellings must conform.\n\n1 Introduction and related research\nPeople who buy a house typically have little, if any, input into the design. Because changing the technical drawings is a\nlaborious and error-prone process, no more than a few alternatives are typically offered. By using constraints, however,\nchanges can be made while guaranteeing the new design is still valid. This enables the client to make changes to the\ndesign without incurring significant additional costs.\nThe idea of automatically checking building, while common in the mechanical engineering industry (Gross 1996; Bettig\nand Shah 2003), has yet to be widely adopted in the building industry. The only major commercial CAD package to\nfeature enforceable rules so far is Revit (Strömberg 2006). Projects that use such rules in practice, such as SMARTcodes\n(Wix, Nisbet and Liebich 2008) exist, but are few and far between. When such rules are used, they are frequently only\napplied to the geometry and not to non-physical aspects such as materials, costs or thermal isolation (Eggink, Gross\nand Do 2001; Nassara, Belblidia and Alby 2003; Thabeth and Beliveau 2003).\n\n2 System description\nWe propose a system where the buyer of a house can change the architect’s design before the house is built, to achieve a\nbetter match with their needs. The traditional way of doing this, where each client would have to separately confer with the\narchitect face-to-face, works only for small projects and does not scale up well to the more typical large housing projects. In\nour approach, the architect, after creating the initial design, defines a set of constraints (Kelleners 1999; Donath and Böhme\n2007). After the initial design and the rules are completed, the buyer can modify the design within the rules of the architect.\n\n3 Constraints\nWe define a constraint to be an assertion about building elements. It is effectively a function that takes as its argument a\nlist of building elements and returns a Boolean, indicating whether all the elements satisfy the constraint. Unfortunately,\nconstraints like this only work for requirements that can be objectively judged. Rules about aesthetical quality, for\ninstance, will still have to be checked by humans. In our system we opt for constraint checking instead of constraint\nsolving, since the solution space is far too large to effectively solve the constraints automatically and because this\nprocess does not give the user enough input.\nAt some point, the constraints will have to be entered into the system. This action will most commonly be performed by\narchitects, as most of the building codes and law constraints will only have to be entered once. The goal, therefore, is to\nfind a method of constraint entry that is easy for architects to work with. There are several alternatives, shown in Table 1:\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n245\n\nOne Size Fits None –\nA User Interface for Constraint-Based Design\nInput type\n\nAdvantages\n\nDisadvantages\n\nProgramming language\ne.g. Java, Python, Haskell\n\nPowerful Easy implementation\n\nDifficult syntax Requires training\n\nDomain-Specific Language\n\nEasier syntax than programming\nlanguage\n\nStill requires training\n\nNatural language\n\nNo training required Very easy to\nuse\n\nVery difficult to implement\n\nTree-based input, e.g. Yahoo Pipes\n\nGraphical User Interface\n\nDifficult to read\n\nBlock input, e.g. Lego Mindstorms\nNXT\n\nFairly easy to read\n\nNot as compact to display as a\nlanguage-based solution\n\nTable 1\n\nWe have chosen the block input, or “puzzle piece,” option since we believe it offers the most advantages and the\nleast disadvantages. One change we make, however, is that instead of representing every constraint as a single\nsequence of pieces, they are split up into four different sections. This is because initial paper-only tests revealed that\nall but the shortest sentences would quickly become very hard to understand. We have opted to split constraints\ninto elements, definitions, conditions, and rules. The elements section defines which elements the constraint applies\nto. The definitions section allows creating definitions similar to those found in legal documents. While most useful if a\nconcept is referred to more than once, they can also help to split up long sentences. Conditions are a further filtering\nof the elements the constraint applies to. Finally, rules determine the rules the filtered elements must obey. Table 2\nshows two example translations, taken from the Dutch building codes for dormers.\nOriginal constraint\n\nTranslated constraint\n\nThe material of walls of dormers must be wood sheet,\nwood or zinc\n\nElement: Walls in Dormers\nDefinition: m is its material\nCondition: Rules: m must be wood or m must be wood sheet or\nm must be zinc\n\nHalf-span roofs with an angle of less than 30 degrees\ncannot contain dormers\n\nElement: Dormers\nDefinitions: Conditions: The type of its roof must be half-span roof\nRules: The angle of its roof must be more than 30\ndegrees\n\n4 Prototype descriptions\n\nTable 2\nExample translations\n\nFigure 1\nPrototype main screen\n\nWe developed a working prototype based on the\napproach described above, to test whether or not it\nworks in practice. Figure 1 shows the main screen of\nthe prototype, where the four sections of a constraint\ncan be edited. In these four sections, rules can be\nadded, edited and deleted. Creating or editing a rule\nbrings up the puzzle sequence editor, shown in figure\n2. In the puzzle sequence editor, the left side of the\nscreen contains the “library” of available pieces. These\ncan be dragged over to the work area on the right,\nwhere they are assembled into constraints. When\na puzzle piece is placed, the input is checked by a\ngrammar to see which pieces can legally follow it. The\npuzzle piece library on the left is updated to show only\nthose pieces. As a result, the user sees only useful\npieces, which reduces information overload and\nmakes it easy to see if a mistake has been made: if\nthe desired piece is not listed there must be an error in\nthe sentence. When the constraints are checked, the\nsequences of puzzle pieces are converted to functions\nthat are applied to every building element of the\nhouse (since the filtering takes place in the functions)\nand any violations are then reported to the user.\n\n246\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nOne Size Fits None –\nA User Interface for Constraint-Based Design\nFigure 2\nPuzzle sequence edit\nwindow\n\n5 Discussion\nAlthough the chosen puzzle piece approach seems to be reasonably successful in allowing people to define constraints,\nit is not a very fast method. Having to drag all the pieces to the correct location is a rather laborious process. Having\nsaid that, the task load should decrease in time, because many constraints will recur in different projects. The architect\ncan build up a library of constraints for many different building elements that can be re-used after minor adaptation in\nother projects. As for the system as a whole, it will most likely not replace any existing methods. It will instead become\nan additional option for the architect. Some architects make one design, some offer several, and in the future some\narchitects will allow clients to make decisions of their own.\n\nReferences\nBelblidia, S., E. Alby. 2003.

Employing data-driven techniques requires a solid understanding of not only digital\ndesign tools, but also material performances and the manufacturing process. Therefore, it is necessary to rethink new\nstrategies in order to establish a robust connective tissue between disciplines and specializations.\nIn a data-driven architectural practice, an aptitude for exploration and advanced experimentation in generative techniques\nis needed for the entire design process, from the earliest experiments to the final production phase. Therefore, bringing\nnew digital productions to the scale of a real building implies the need for radical innovation in non-standardized building\nsolutions. This paradigm shift implies rethinking buildings as systems rather than the juxtaposition of optimized and\nmonofunctional layers.\nOne of the main challenges of data-driven architectural practice is maintaining consistency from design to materialization.\nThus, by pursuing a holistic, nonlinear approach and an interdisciplinary practice, designers can move away from a\ntraditional linear production workflow based on a succession of fragmented processes. Through the pursuit of data-driven\narchitectural practice, the boundaries between the specializations of architect, engineer, and designer become blurred.\nThis paper is rooted in a personal research agenda based in Systems Thinking, currently under development at\nHyperbody, the research group guided by Prof. Ir. Kas Oosterhuis. Systems Thinking is at the core of the research\ninitiative, Performative Design Processes for Architecture ([P]a), pursuing the development of Multiperformative Efficient\nSystems (MES) as one of its possible catalysts.\n\nKeywords\nSystems Thinking, efficiency, differentiation, material performances, mass customization, form finding, digital fabrication,\ndesign intelligence, computation, and parametric-associative strategies for design and manufacturing.\n\nIntroduction\nThere are several questions and assumptions steering the research behind MES, such as: What disciplines and\nspecializations are contributing to shape the new intellectual framework motivating design innovation? As the move\ntowards mass customization of production systems hosts the potential for a decisive break in materializing novel\ndesign processes and efficient production techniques, what effect does this have on architectural praxis? The\nchallenge for today’s designers lies in the shaping of a new design intelligence, whereby the process of development\nby experimentation through every stage of the design process becomes significant to the success of the final result.\n\n[M]SYSTEMS\n[M]SYSTEMS is a study case of the research agenda on Performative Design Processes for Architecture. [M]SYSTEMS\nis an experimental demo project that aims at developing MES through morphogenetic design strategies. At the core\nof the project is the exploration of an integral design strategy that is capable of catalyzing material behaviors in a real-\n\n248\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nMultiperformative Efficient Systems (MES)\nTowards System Thinking\ntime adaptive system, as well as catalyzing manufacturing and assembly logics. Parametric Associative Strategies for\nDesign and Manufacturing are instrumentalized in order to first pursue a generative strategy, and second to explore\nperformative capacities of the outcomes.\nThe first phase of development targets the exploration of physical prototypes. The research aims at finding a simple\nperformative component as a possible candidate for proliferation in a larger system. From a very early stage, the\nintegration of assembly and manufacturing logics informs the empirical research of the physical genotype (fig. 1).\nFigure 1 Modulation and\ngeometric analysis of the\nphysical components\n\nThe second phase points at generating the adaptive digital system. First, the behavior of the physical system is analyzed and\nabstracted by a set of mathematic, geometric, and parametric topological relationships. Then, the system (phenotype) is\nbuilt according to those principles, and developed further through the exploration of parametric associative software (fig. 2).\n\nFigure 2 ParametricAssociative System.\nProject sponsored by\nMissler Italy\n\nThe real-time bidirectional exchange of\ninformation between the designer and\nthe system is a reciprocal relationship\nthat continuously changes the designer’s\nunderstanding of the project as it is being\ndeveloped, which, in turn, influences the\ndecisions the designer makes.\nThe capacity for multiple possible\nfutures (adaptations) is embedded\nin the same system. The system’s\nadaptations are achieved through\nparametric-associative\nmodulation\nof its performative components.\nThe performative capacities of the\ncomponents respond to the limits of\nmaximum and minimum modulation\nof real physical behavior. Thus, the\npossible n-adaptations of the system\ncannot exceed established physical\nlimits. Because of the material\nintelligence built into the system, the\nsystem inherently behaves according\nto the manufacturing and assembly\nfeatures integrated into the design.\nFigure 3 The\ndifferentiated porosity\nemerges according\nto the local geometric\nproperties of the system.\nPrototype sponsored by\nARRK Europe (BCN).\n\nThe outcome of the design strategy is a complex adaptive system. The system’s complexity is achieved through the\nsimple incremental steps of an evolutionary process. The integrated focus on material, design, and manufacturing makes\nit possible for the system to be manipulated and manufactured in real time. Finally, the software, according to the new\nconfiguration, immediately and automatically regenerates all technical drawings, data tables, and manufacturing layouts as\nsoon as the system is manipulated (fig. 4).\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n249\n\nMultiperformative Efficient Systems (MES)\nTowards System Thinking\n\nConclusion\n\nFigure 4 Data-driven,\nform-finding process.\n\nThe architectural domain is increasingly moving towards empirical methodologies, using strategies and processes of\nThe generative strategy\ndevelopment rather than pre-deterministic approaches. Thus, a more experimental aptitude is replacing the processes integrates manufacturing\nof metaphorization that currently exist in the practice of architecture.\nand assembly features.\nThe research in Performative Design Processes for Architecture targets a nonlinear, holistic methodology while stressing\nthe necessity for an experimental and interdisciplinary aptitude. In this framework, the process of design becomes a\nprocess of creating knowledge. In order to grasp and catalyze the potentialities for innovation in architectural practice,\nit is useful to engage in a performative design process. The development of performative design processes implies the\nunderstanding of new degrees of complexity on the part of the designer.\nWorking on the [M]SYSTEMS project provided the opportunity to explore some of the topics related to the [P]a research\nagenda. The design approach described in this paper, which is strongly informed by material processes, demonstrated\nthe robust generative capability for the development of MES. The linkage between the processes of design and\nmanufacturing is a strong feature of the empirically driven methodology. The qualities of the results achieved show that\nintegrating production logic at an early stage of the design is a parameter that enriches the entire process.\nAs [P]a focuses on developing a contemporary discourse in the architectural domain, further improvement of [M]\nSYSTEMS will be necessary to cover the entire research agenda of [P]a. Therefore, [M]SYSTEMS will need significant\nimprovements in order to achieve solid architectural qualities. Nevertheless, [M]SYSTEMS, as a demonstrative case of\nthe wider MES concept, illustrates the pursuit of a radical innovation of the project practice, and, thus, [M]SYSTEMS\nrepresents the foundation for further, promising exploration in [P]a.\nResearch in [P]a is focused on the understanding of generative formation and materialization as the integrated features of\na unique project development process. Rooted in Systems Thinking, [P]a takes up the challenge of exploring innovative\n\n250\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nMultiperformative Efficient Systems (MES)\nTowards System Thinking\nsolutions to architectural applications for full-scale buildings. Furthermore, the research agenda on [P]a promotes\nthe experimentation with holistic approaches as a break from the methodological reductionism diffused in traditional\narchitectural practice. Thus, this research initiative aims at laying the groundwork for the development of efficient\nsolutions that are capable of interacting with the technical, economical, and social development of contemporary society.\n\nReferences\nAshby, M.

Some of these methods are\ndescribed in this paper for applications to high-rise buildings and long-span roof structures.\n\n252\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nScripting for a New Architecture: Studies in Structural Optimization\n\n1 Introduction\nOptimal structural topologies represent a new frontier in architecture and set a new standard against which we\ncan compare the performance of existing and future structures. Inspired by the seminal paper by A. G. M. Michell\n(1904), structural engineers at SOM have been using several tools for optimization of structural shapes and systems\nfor developing efficient structural/architectural topologies. Among these tools are Michell frames, principal stress\ntrajectories, evolutionary structural optimization, genetic algorithms, and force density.\nScripting plays a major role in enabling access to the programming interface of commercial software and the use of\nseveral of their built-in functions to code optimization algorithms. Commercial, in-house, and university-developed\nsoftware that employs various types of optimization techniques (based on gradient methods, genetic algorithms, hybrid\nprocedures) have also all been successfully applied for topology and shape optimization of several potential high-rise\nprojects and long-span structures.\n\n2 Michell Frames\nIn 1904, A. G. M. Michell published his seminal paper on frame structures of least weight, where he identified the\noptimal solution for several structural systems, including a cantilever beam that transfers a tip point load to a circular\nsupport. This solution is composed of two sets of logarithmic spirals intersecting at right angles. In a logarithmic\nspiral, the angle between the tangent and the radius always remains constant.\nThe continuous circular support of Michell’s optimal solution is an aspect that needs to be addressed in a real frame.\nIf we utilize the geometric solutions by Hill (1950) for tracing the slip lines field in perfectly plastic materials (i.e.,\nHencky Nets), we can find the solution for a truss supported at two points with a script. The next step in the optimal\ncantilever problem is to introduce a constraint for the width of the frame. Figure 1 illustrates the truss layouts based\non the formulation by Graczykowski and Lewinski (2006) for a truss bounded by a rectangular region. The aspect\nratio for the solution in figure 1 at the top is similar to the one proposed by Hemp (1973). On the other hand, the\nsolution in figure 1 at the bottom is more slender with an aspect ratio of 3.5.\nFigure 2 Principal\nstress trajectories for a\ntube building\n\n3Principal stress trajectories\nThe flow of lateral forces in a high-rise building can be studied analytically using basic principles of\nmechanics like the concept of principal stress trajectories. The equations governing the problem\nare solved numerically in a CAD script, and then the lines of force are traced. Assumptions\nconcerning the load distribution and the plan geometry of the building have to be simplified.\nTypically, for a first concept design, a uniform load is considered and the cross section is\nassimilated to a tube or an ‘I’ shape. The results of the analysis for the case of a tube and uniform\nlateral load are shown in figure 2 on the left. Notice that when the wind is blowing in a certain\ndirection, the longitudinal walls of the tube are working as a web, while the transverse walls are\nworking as flanges.\nSince the design has to cover the entire range of possible wind directions, the actual optimal\nstress trajectories are a combination of the flange solution and the web solution.\nPrincipal stress trajectories have been used to inform the layout of the outer diagonal bracing\nsystem in several conceptual designs for high-rise buildings (fig. 2)\n\n4Shape Optimization\nShape optimization was recently employed to determine the most efficient form of a large roof\nstructure for a design competition. The roof was approximately 216 m in length by 90 m in width,\nand it was constrained to have enough clear height at specific locations to fit the interior structure.\nThe roof curvature was optimized for self-weight as well as for imposed loads using several\nsoftware components linked via their respective Application Programming Interfaces (API’s):\n• Optimization algorithm: HEEDS (Hierarchical Evolutionary Engineering Design System) from\nRed Cedar Technology (www.redcedartech.com)\n• Parametric Geometry Modeling: Digital Project (www.gehrytechnologies.com)\n• Structural Analysis Strand7 (www.strand7.com)\nAt each iteration of the optimization process, the optimization engine (HEEDS) sends updated\nvalues of the design variables to the geometry modeling software (Digital Project). This software\nmodifies the model accordingly and creates an IGES file with the new geometry. This file with the\nupdated geometry is imported into the finite element software (Strand7). A finite element mesh\nis created, and loads and boundary conditions are applied to the model. The structural analysis\nsolver is run, and the required response quantity (i.e., the objective of the optimization, which is\ncompliance for this case) is then calculated and sent to the optimization engine to complete the\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n253\n\nScripting for a New Architecture: Studies in Structural Optimization\n\niteration. This optimization framework presents a rather flexible architecture, applicable to a large number of problems.\nThe results from the shape optimization process are presented in figure 3. As the optimization process advances, the\nshape of the structure changes and produces smaller values of the deflection, maximizing its overall stiffness. The\noptimized structure is both structurally efficient and aesthetically pleasant\n\nFigure 3 Shape\noptimization results\n\nConclusion\nSeveral optimization methodologies and scripting tools are available to architects and engineers. The interdisciplinary\ncollaboration between them leads to new forms and geometries that are at the same time structurally efficient,\naesthetically appealing, and very functional.\n\nReferences\nMichell A.

The research presented explores double-layer tensegrity\ngrids that utilize 3D “compressed” components. A case study demonstrates their applicability to the formation of\nsophisticated building envelopes that can actively or passively respond to changes in the environment. A computational\nform-finding tool is introduced to study design variations in real time. This tool is shown to expand the design spectrum\nby supporting increased complexity and revealing unexpected design potential. This research is significant as it\noutlines a practical methodology for conceiving responsive building systems. In particular, it illustrates an approach that\nsynthesizes design concerns with engineering and fabrication goals.\n\n1 Introduction\n1.1 Tensegrity Structures\nTensegrity is a structural concept that appears to follow the fundamental principles of material efficiency and adaptability\nfound in the natural world. It is relevant at many scales and has been used to describe the configuration of the universe\n(Fuller 1975), the physiology of the human body, and the structural behavior exhibited by water molecules, proteins,\nviruses, and other biological cells. Of particular appeal to architects and engineers is the fact that tensegrity structures\nconsolidate a number of important design, engineering, and fabrication concerns. These include stability, functionality,\nscalability, ornament, structural clarity, efficiency, materiality, and form-generating potential. Tensegrity structures are, thus,\nfruitful territory for exploring a co-rational approach to design, where form is inextricably linked with force, and design\nconception is enmeshed with appropriate strategies for design realization.\nTensegrity structures are particularly interesting when considering the development of responsive systems, and have been\nexplored by a number of researchers in a variety of fields. Perhaps most notable within the contemporary architectural\ndomain is Tristan Sterk’s research into actuated tensegrity structures. Of critical significance is the fact that tensegrity\nstructures are lightweight and characterized by a state of “dynamic equilibrium” (Hanaor 1992). Effectively, this means\nthat their shape is dependent upon a combination of topological characteristics, material properties, and the amount\nof pre-stress in tensile elements. Due to the interdependent nature of all the elements, a slight change in any of these\nparameters can result in a significant shape transformation. Engineer, Rene Motro presents a comprehensive definition of\ntensegrity structures and one that specifically covers the novel assemblies described in this paper: “A tensegrity state is a\nstable self-equilibrated state of a system containing a discontinuous set of compressed components inside a continuum\nof tensioned components” (Motro 2002).\n\n1.2 3D Components\nThe majority of research and discourse to date has focused on class 1, 2, and 3 tensegrity structures assembled from\ntensile cables and linear compressive struts. There are few practical examples where compressed components consist\nof subassemblies that form geometries that are more complex. Regarding the definition above, Motro explicitly notes, “the\nshape of the ‘compressed components’ is not prescribed to be linear, surface or volume type.” In a concurrent publication,\nthe authors of this paper report on the development and assembly of 3D components that can be used to construct a\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n255\n\nKinetic Tensegrity Grids with 3D Compressed Components\n\nvariety of modular tensegrity structures. Included in this article is a more comprehensive overview of the research domain\nand a number of speculative design projects (Frumar et al. 2009).\nUsing 3D components in place of linear struts restricts the kinematics of each tensegrity module. When modules are\ninterconnected, this property results in a more rigid and robust framework than conventional tensegrity assemblies.\nMoreover, 3D components significantly reduce strut congestion and fabrication complexity by minimizing the number of\nindividual structural elements needed to induce a tensegrity state.\n\n1.3 Form Finding – The (Inter)Active Digital Model\nOnce a series of tensegrity modules is interconnected, it is possible to generate a wide variety of forms by varying\nthe length/pre-stress of tensile elements and the proportions of compressed components. While basic structures\ncomposed from a small number of modules are best explored as physical models, when an assembly reaches a\ncertain size and level of complexity, it becomes impractical to build it physically during explorative phases of design.\nThis “representational divide” becomes a significant limitation to the design process and suggests that a dynamic and\nideally interactive digital model is necessary to support the early stage design development of sophisticated tensegrity\nstructures. Calculating the shape of tensegrity structures in a digital environment requires form-finding procedures that\ncan establish “a geometry compatible with a self-stress state” (Motro 2002), and generally speaking, this functionality is\nnot supported within the current generation of CAE and CAAD software (Burkhart 2008; Sterk 2007).\nIn a publication just prior to his passing, the late Dr. Thomas Seebohm describes three-dimensional tensegrity structures\ngenerated from two-dimensional “topologies” using a Java applet named Struck (Seebohm 2008). Struck is a formfinding tool developed in 1998 by a computer programmer named Gerald De Jong, specifically to find the form of\ntensegrity systems (De Jong 1998). It activates otherwise inert geometry by introducing tensile and compressive forces.\nStruck calculates the form of a system given its initial geometry and the desired rest length of each “structural” element.\nThe form-finding process is visualized in real time and uses color mapping to identify compressed components (red),\ntensile members (blue), and redundant structural elements (black). There is very little documentation about how Struck\nactually works, making Seebohm’s research important for elucidating some of the mathematical principles behind the\ninterface. From his descriptions, it is clear that Struck is based on relatively simple particle-spring logic and is sufficiently\naccurate to support the design exploration of complex tensegrity structures. One limitation noted by Seebohm is that\nthe Struck interface does not conveniently allow complex topologies to be entered. To properly engage Struck as a\ndesign tool, it is necessary to develop a bidirectional link with standard CAAD software. The authors have had the\nprivilege of access to Dr. Seebohm’s digital archives containing his work on tensegrity structures, including an AutoLISP\nscript he developed for generating Struck input data from two-dimensional line work in AutoCAD.\nWe have developed a script for Rhinoceros that extends this process into three dimensions. Initial geometry is\ngenerated in Rhinoceros and assigned either tensile or compressive properties using a layer naming convention.\nMultiple layers can be used to define different rest lengths and properties for different elements. Once the system\nis activated in Struck, it becomes possible to explore design variations in real time by using a parameter slider to\nchange the rest lengths of tensile and compressive elements. Because all structural elements are interdependent,\nglobal geometry can be manipulated by adjusting a limited number of local parameters. A recent publication by the\nauthors (Frumar and Zhou 2009) presents detailed information about Struck, as well as an overview of alternate\ncomputational tools that can aid in the design of complex tensegrity structures.\n\n2 A Case Study – Kinetic Grid 01\n2.1 Initial Schematic\nTwo components previously developed by the authors were noted for their ability to interconnect. When attached in\nthe correct manner, the two components form a tensegrity grid with regular openings. The grid is infinitely extensible\nin three axes. Initially, the aim of this investigation was to explore a convergence of design and engineering goals by\ninvestigating the architectural potential of this particular grid assembly. It was envisioned as a large, spanning static\nbuilding envelope suitable for constructing non-standard architectural geometries. To verify that such an assembly\nwould be self-stressed and stable, a physical model approximately 300 x 300 mm was built using interlocking laser-cut\ntimber and fishing line (fig. 1).\n\n256\n\nFigure 1 3D\ncomponents, physical\nassembly, “inert”\nRhinoceros geometry\nand “activated”\nassembly in Struck\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nKinetic Tensegrity Grids with 3D Compressed Components\n\n2.2 Activating the Grid in Struck\nOnce the stability of the grid assembly was confirmed through the physical model-making process, a digital model was\ncreated in Rhinoceros to get a better understanding of what the assembly would look like “en masse.” The inert Rhino\ngeometry was used to generate the input data for an active digital model in Struck. The initial geometry and activated\nassembly are illustrated in figure 1. Geometry exported from Rhinoceros, generally speaking, is not initially active in\nStruck. Activation is achieved by gradually adjusting the various lengths of members until all members are acting in\ntension or compression. As mentioned previously, this process changes the color of the geometry from black (meaning\nstructural elements are carrying no load) to red (compressed components) and blue (tensile elements). Importantly,\nduring this procedure, it becomes immediately apparent if the assembly is unstable and if there are any elements that\ncould be removed without compromising the overall integrity of the structure.\nActivating the grid geometry in Struck proved particularly rewarding. Despite our initial goal of creating a static building\nenvelope, it became apparent during the initial phases of the “tuning” process, that the grid assembly could be distorted\nin a number of unexpected ways. Of particular interest was the ability to manipulate openings in the structure. The active\ndigital model enabled us to determine an appropriate means of controlling this movement using a series of extra cables\nplaced in the positions shown in figure 3. The additional cables create an astonishing effect. The entire structure is able\nto transform between closed and open states. The transparency and porosity of the assembly can be controlled in real\ntime by adjusting the length of the additional cables. Furthermore, the inclusion of actuated “spines” makes it possible\nto control the global shape of the structure as illustrated in figure 1. Significantly, the shape and porosity controllers are\nindependent and can be operated individually or in unison. In a full-scale construction, heat-activated actuators could\nbe used to passively control this movement.\nA physical model was built to test the discoveries made in Struck. The model was constructed with rotating joints in the\nrequired locations. Figure 3 demonstrates that the physical model operates analogously to its digital counterpart and\nmaintains stability in all positions. With these properties confirmed, an expanded digital model was developed to further\nexplore the potential architectural applicability of the grid structure. The most obvious application is lightweight dynamic\nfaçade systems and building envelopes that actively respond to contextual forces by reducing energy loads on and\nwithin the built environment (fig. 4).\n\nFigure 2 Gradient\nbetween closed and\nopen states – digital\nand physical models\n\nFigure 3 Visualization\nof responsive building\nenvelope that can\nmodulate heat and light\nby altering porosity and\ntransparency\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n257\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nKinetic Tensegrity Grids with 3D Compressed Components\n\n3Further Grid Assemblies\nFurther kinetic grid studies that use 3D compressed components are illustrated in figure 5, to demonstrate some\nalternate configurations. To ensure the stability of these assemblies, physical models were not necessary, as Struck\nwas used to “tune” them carefully into shape.

A common feature is\nthat shape, porosity, and transparency can be controlled with correctly placed actuators and suitable compressed\ncomponent mechanisms.\nFigure 4 Alternate\nkinetic tensegrity grid\nconfigurations\n\nConclusion\nThe research presented in this paper introduces a methodology for generating a virtually unlimited assortment of\nkinetic and rigid tensegrity grid structures with 3D components. The use of 3D “compressed” components is shown\nto increase the design spectrum available to architects wishing to explore tensegrity structures by enlarging the field\nof potential tessellations and providing more appropriate structural properties than typical tensegrity assemblies.\nAn innovative Java applet that supports design exploration was introduced. This tool enables real-time and\ninteractive structural evaluation of complex tensegrity structures, and avoids the need for building physical models\nin order to verify the stability and means of actuation in kinetic assemblies. Although not adequate for full design and\nengineering resolution, the Struck applet is an outstanding example of a design-based environment that extends\ncomputation beyond the inert representational realm characteristic of standard CAAD tools. It certainly begins\nto address some of the functionality needed to support early stage design development of responsive building\ntechnologies, structures, and systems. It is important to note, the behavior of the active digital model in Struck is\nroughly equivalent to that of small-scale physical models where self-weight is negligible. Full-scale construction\nof the assemblies presented would require significant software development to enable material properties and\nstructural forces to be accurately determined. Furthermore, practical means of integrating these types of systems\nwith typical building requirements such as waterproofing and harvesting/shedding of rainwater is necessary.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis paper presents outcomes from an ongoing research project being undertaken at the Royal Melbourne\nInstitute of Technology between the Spatial Information Architecture Laboratory (SIAL) and the Innovative\nStructures Group (ISG).

Given the dominance of certain concerns within the profession\nof architecture during that time—prefabrication and strict modularity—the selected case studies reveal\nunprecedented characteristics which anticipate current developments in algorithmic and parametric formation.\nThe projects in question demonstrate sophisticated strategies for differentiated part-to-whole relationships\nwhich predate contemporary organizational systems, now derived with the aid of digital computation. Their\nimportance to current architectural discourse lies in distinguishing the manner in which they manifest notions\nof space-time, including transformation, continuity and modulation, as architects increasingly operate within\ndexterous and interconnected environments.\n\n“To divide unity, to fuse disparity—such is the life of\nnature.”—J. W. Goethe\nContemporary architectural formations make use of systemic organization—modeling procedures based\non rules, constants, and variables that operate within flexible frameworks. The use of such methods today,\ntypically in the guise of software or individually authored scripts, has dramatically affected the conception of\nform. As the products of these processes are dependent on the manipulation of parameters set up by the\narchitect, design strategies are increasingly characterized by the benefits and limitations of relational systems.\nWorking in this way, designers no longer draw static assemblies of discrete elements but, instead, model\ndynamic and associative organizations of integrated, architectural componentry. Due to the procedural nature\nof computation, the discipline of architecture has recently been witness to a widespread, increased investment\nin such processes. The resultant formal organizations are often characterized by a perceptual inseparability of\npart and whole and are approaching irreducible formations.\nAlthough recent technological advances have facilitated an increase in thinking parametrically, conceptualization\nof form as correspondingly flexible system(s) is certainly not without precedent. During the 1950s, as the scientific\ndiscoveries of space-time reached the creative disciplines—which encouraged observation and creation of\nformations as dynamic and in-flux rather than fixed and static—some architects tested new strategies for\nformal and material organization that surpassed standard, pre-fabricated, modular-design practices and tended\ntoward higher degrees of complexity and flexibility. Historically registering the influence of these ideologies are\nfour architectural examples that share chronological proximity, each being conceptualized and built between\n1954 and 1960. They include Iannis Xenakis’ fenestration pattern at The Monastery of Sainte Marie de La\nTourette, Felix Candela’s Church Iglesia de la Virgen Milagrosa, Eladio Dieste’s Church of Christ the Worker,\nand Pier Luigi Nervi’s Palazzetto dello Sport in Rome. Each design represents a unique method of incorporation\nof space-time principles and can be tested against (provisional) categories that highlight differences among\nmethods of formation and design ambitions. These categories are: (1) proportion and dynamism, (2) geometry\nand continuity, and (3) simulation and flexibility.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n259\n\nApproaching Irreducible Formations\nOrganization of matter and processes of material formation are themes that underwent significant reconceptualization\nduring mid-twentieth-century cultural production, as reverberations from the “new field of space-time” spread throughout\ncreative disciplines. Matter, formerly understood to be comprised of static assemblies of discrete elements, by the\n1950s had been reinterpreted as series of kinetic, associative, and interdependent systems. Limitations to conventional\nmethods of observation were lifted in order to perceive likenesses between natural and synthetic morphologies.\nOstensibly disparate scales became seamlessly linked, patterns and processes became fused, compositions and\nmethods of transformation became coupled; in effect, cultural producers were “thinking in relationships.”\nDespite a majority of attention being directed toward other architectural concerns during this time—such as, waning\nbut lingering postwar reconstruction efforts, interests in prefabrication, the promise of products of the second industrial\nrevolution, concentration on mass housing and scientific planning strategies—formal analyses were being executed,\nspecifically, analyses highlighting shared characteristics between modern painting and architecture. Artists Laszlo\nMoholy-Nagy and Gyorgy Kepes initially endorsed “transparency,” a concept giving language to the effect of gestalt\nwithin an artwork, as a worthy indicator of the arrival of space-time to the arts. Later, architectural theorist Colin Rowe\nand artist Robert Slutzky further articulated the idea, distinguishing between “literal” and “phenomenal transparency,”\nsubstantiating their claims through comparisons of formal structure in painting and facade composition in architecture,\nboth sharing a disposition to frontal alignment. Although their work underscored an important by-product of transdisciplinary cross-examination, it limited its focus to effects produced on the painterly plane, to two-dimensional\npatterns, fields, and figures. The notion that multiplicitous legibilities can coexist (or persist) within a single object as a\nresult of part-to-whole promiscuity has several formal manifestations, of which Rowe and Slutzky’s example is only one.\nFigure 1 Iannis Xenakis,\nSainte Marie de La\nTourette, 1956–1960\n\nAn ambition of this essay is to direct attention to precedents from the late 1950s that are illustrative of novel methods\nof material organization, which likewise tend toward their own unique forms of irreducibility.\nIrreducible formations are those material organizations that resist immediate discernment of their part-to-whole\nrelationships. Abstractly, they refer to an inseparability of framework (latent or manifest) and matter. In contemporary\nversions—usually parametrically conceived organizations—interrelationships are designed as flexible networks around\n\n260\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nApproaching Irreducible Formations\nwhich specifications for materiality are assigned. Instead of compositions that\nare conceptualized in a fixed state and, therefore, immediately sub-divisible,\nmetric definitions in a dynamic state are capable of continually being modified,\nthrough time or space. In such formations, similar effects to those described\nby Rowe and Slutzky occur; temporary hierarchies are emergent, as are\nexplicit but ephemeral patterns and configurations. However, in such cases,\nthe fluctuation of transitory orders tends to be understood as belonging to\na single system of differentiated homogeneity, rather than a heterogeneous\ncollection of elements with multiple inter-allegiances. Within the bounds\nof this essay, the notion of space-time will serve as a datum from which\ndifferences in organizational strategies and formations between the selected\narchitectural examples can be measured. Industrial-modular logic, utility, and\nefficiency were pervasive codes to which many architects adhered during the\n1950s. Entrenched in the prospects of prefabrication and mass production,\nuniversality, and repetition, few professional architects produced works that\nventured beyond strict modularity. However, several projects do exist that are\nevidential of architects using a wide array of techniques and concentrations.\nThrough their composition, form, and/or structure, these projects either represent a conscious deviation from standard\nmodular-design practices or possess formal characteristics that imply dynamic continuity.\n\nFigure 2 Eladio\nDieste, Church of\nChrist the Worker,\nAtlantida, 1958–1960\n\nBeyond Static Proportions\nSystems of proportion govern relative measurements within compositions. Through use of a metric template, proportional\norders privilege particular scalar or rhythmic relationships while preventing others. During the early to mid-twentieth\ncentury, shortly before the new field of space-time saturated creative disciplines, modes of measurement that were\nseen to perpetuate socioculturally embedded conditionings were challenged under the auspices of Modernism. In\nmusic, for example, the continued inheritance of the Western tonal system, one embedded with hierarchal structures,\nwas scrutinized and proposals were made for its replacement. Composer Arnold Schoenberg, with others, devised\na non-hierarchical system whereby each of twelve tones received equal value, shedding any points of reference to a\ntonal center. The neutralization of all intervals required the development of new strategies for formal manipulation and,\nlikewise, a vocabulary to name the correspondent compositional attributes. Descriptions were no longer feasible in\nterms of a melodic-figure and harmonic-ground, but rather, terminology referencing the kinetic characteristics of twelvetone music was introduced: directionality of a pitch sequence and its relative orientation. Similar experiments with spatial\nordering systems were practiced architecturally.\n\nFigure 3\nFelix Candela,\nChurch Iglesia de\nla Virgen Milagrosa,\nNarvarte, 1955\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n261\n\nApproaching Irreducible Formations\nIannis Xenakis, empowered by Le Corbusier to design the fenestration pattern at The Monastery of Sainte Marie de La\nTourette, extended the relational possibilities inherent to Le Corbusier’s Modulor. As a proportional system, it spliced\nModern man into an infinite scalar range of interconnectivity. Its basic metric relationships referenced the anatomical\nsubdivisions of the human body, while extensions in both directions were enabled by a sequence of addition (or\nsubtraction), using Fibonacci principles. Until this time, Modulor had primarily been used as a dimensional guide for the\narrangement of shifting rectangular panels and windows on a grid, other organizational potentials remained dormant.\nXenakis, who was also an avant-garde musical composer, interpreted the system as one of continuity, of seamless\nexpansion and contraction. The fenestration pattern at La Tourette is indicative of a practice of differentiation within a\nhomogeneous system (fig. 1). Its compositional framework and material pattern are conflated to form a parametrically\norganized composite, the interrelationships of which are flexible and tunable. This difference in compositional strategy\nplaces the design in the spaces between matter, rather than in the material elements themselves. On the concept of\ndegrees of difference and continuity in Xenakis’ formal systems, historian Bernard Teyssedre notes, “You no longer use\nelements as starting points, but rather their relationships, their intervals, and in relation to one of these intervals, we\ncould say that the elements would play merely a secondary role as ‘trail-markers’ between the two extreme points.”\n\nToward Differentiated Repetition\nCharacterized by “elementary methods, primary forms, simple numbers and equal elements,” variation in modular\nsystems before the advent of space-time was limited to the finite results of unit-combination. “Combinatory possibilities\nseem to be the nature of things; the arrangement of atoms determines properties. There are, for instance, seventy-one\ncompounds which have the same molecular formula but have differently arranged patterns of atomic symmetry.” In\nFigure 4 Pier Luigi\nNervi, Palazzetto\ndello Sport, Rome,\n1958\n\nsuch compositions, variability was not expressed within the form, but by the extents, or outer perimeter of form, as in\na molecular chain or a pre-established kit of parts. This produced constructions that were dependent on the innate\nvariable-potential of a single, repeated, prefabricated module. The replacement of discrete modules with discreet\nmodules—elements which are visibly and operationally de-emphasized relative to the larger formal system—created\na subordinate or (in special cases) reciprocal relationship between part to whole, which displaced Modernist ideas of\nstrict organizational hierarchy and enabled a new type of formal dexterity.\nDuring the 1950s, Felix Candela and Eladio Dieste, in Mexico and Uruguay respectively, were testing the formal and\nspatial possibilities of systemic and incremental variability. For the elements that were shifting incrementally, the two\narchitects geometrically described them within a continuous material system. This transition to a system of material\nhomogeneity resulted in a change of formal logic from one dependent on a prefabricated unit to one guided by\n\n262\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nApproaching Irreducible Formations\ngeometric principles, the elements of which were linear, sinusoidal, and hyperbolic-paraboloidal. In adopting a\nmathematically guided formal strategy, the architects promoted a systemic flexibility that was inherently based on\nreciprocal internal geometric relationships. With relationships established but formally pliable, formations were being\nconceived “parametrically,” the variables of which were measured in periodicity and amplitude. This is best realized in\nEladio Dieste’s Church of Christ the Worker in Atlantida (fig. 2). Straight-line segments rotating relative to one another\nmade forms that were seemingly complex but easily controllable and feasibly constructible. These forms act as records\nof dynamism: lines shifting through space and time made manifest by continuous material constructions, as can be\nseen in Felix Candela’s Church Iglesia de la Virgen Milagrosa in Narvarte (fig. 3). The conceptual increments of time that\nseamlessly blend the discrete linear elements are of equal or greater importance to their material registration. Richard\nLippold, a sculptor active during the 1950s, once remarked, “Born into a place and an age in which space and time are\nour principle companions-in-concern, I find it inevitable to love them more than solid materials with which my ancestors\nwere involved.”\n\nNearing Simulation\nA simulation is a manifestation (representational or physical) of the behavior of one system executed by a second\nsystem. Painter Ellsworth Kelly developed artificial means to simulate naturally occurring effects through the invention\nof synthetic systems that produced, managed, and manipulated differentiation. In Study for Seine, he used a grid as\nan organizational armature and devised a method of interpretation for the fluctuating light values caused by the river’s\nreflection of the sun. The technique, one of translation, employed chance procedures in selecting which grid cells to\nfill, ensuring an approximate imitation of the randomized field condition. Reproduction of observed dynamic behaviors\nbecame a common practice across disciplines and was one that highlighted connectivity between the natural and\nthe artificial. As artists invested in mechanisms capable of synthetically mimicking processes observed in nature,\nphysicists and mathematicians were likewise working on developing equations to describe the complexities of natural\nprocesses over space and time. Mathematician Norbert Weiner suggested that, “the abstract artist need not confine\nhimself to patterns which he has reached abstractly, but may compose freely about a theme suggested to him by\nnature, because they have a specific mathematical structure.” Weiner’s statement illustrates an overwhelming faith\nin the creative potential of natural processes and the ostensibly endless interrelationships between the arts and the\nsciences. Pier Luigi Nervi made architectural formations that simulated systems of force diagrams through the synthetic\nconstruction system of concrete and steel. The patterns of material articulation at once privileged a structural efficiency\nwhile remaining fused with the continuous surface. Laszlo Moholy-Nagy noted that, “space-time stands for many\nthings: relativity of motion and its measurement, integration, simultaneous grasp of inside and outside and revelation of\nthe structure instead of the facade.” Previously understood as hierarchically distinct and materially discrete systems,\nenclosure and structure became one composite system capable of responsive reorganization dependent on force and\nspace requirements (fig. 4). Such plasticity was made possible through the pairing of an advanced material logic and a\nstructural logic, the capabilities of which are showcased in Nervi’s Palazzetto dello Sport in Rome.\nDescriptions of formations, such as differentiated homogeneity, systemic continuity, flexibility, and simulation, are terms\nthat represent parallels between mid-century and contemporary practices. These material-organizational strategies of\nthe 1950s marked a shift from those influenced by the Modernist canon—from juxtapositions of the rational grid and\nthe free curve to those strategies that illustrated a new flexibility through the combination of both. These four projects\nsponsored a concerted effort to conceptualize formations that “divide unity” rather than “fuse disparity.” They represent\ndistinct and important advancements in design strategy that employ flexible relationships over static compositions.\nThey act as precedents of renewed value, as form-making processes increasingly rely on the design of complex,\ninterdependent and parametric relationships.\n\nReferences\nKwinter, Sanford.

Each\nentity in this case, a block in the city, is described according to its condition and potential for development, such as land\nfunction, accessibility, landscape control, and so on. This not only provides a rich yet subtle identification of each entity,\nbut also creates the basis to establish dynamic interconnections between them. The similarity coefficient, calculated\nby the comparison between the different blocks’ factors fits well with the explanation of the spontaneous development\nof the city. The weight of every factor and the threshold of the similarity coefficient are both set as variables, with the\noptimized value recommended as a default, which ensures a multitudinal application of this software with a focus on\ndifferent aspects of urban planning. The resultant self-regulatory system with flexible input is not only a credible tool for\nderiving plot ratios, but also an effective platform to activate urban design creations. The system, as a socio-technical\ntool, enhances the essential process of urban self-organization and hetero-organization.\n\n1 Introduction\nThe Plot Ratio or Floor Area Ratio (FAR), which is used in zoning to limit the amount of construction in many countries, is the\nratio of the total floor area of the buildings to the size of the land on a certain location. The decision of the plot ratio is usually\nbased on the experience of experts, as well as on the negotiations between related groups, which is not only the intention\nof the planners, but also depending on the influences and references of many other similar blocks in the city from a holistic\npoint of view. Seen in this light, urban form is regarded as a complex adaptive system composed of interconnected\nblocks considering their similarities, which is simultaneously open and interacting with the people who design and build it.\nComputational approaches are employed to simulate this nonlinear interaction process. The algorithm will be introduced\nin the following sections, with the case of Changzhou, a Chinese city.\nFigure 1 Steps of the\nAlgorithm\n\n264\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nAn Interactive Decision Support System for Deriving Plot Ratios\nBased on the Similarity Relations between Land Attributes\n2 Technical Process and Algorithm\nThe technical process of the system is interpreted in the following steps (fig. 1).\n\n2.1 Multifactor Evaluation of Plots\nFirst, the development potential of each urban plot is evaluated by two types of factors: the functionality and the\nlandscape, based on the analysis, questionnaires, and existing urban codes, which were first used in the spatial form\nstudy of Nanjing (Wang et al. 2005). A higher value means more development potential, and vice versa. following the\nevaluation standard (fig. 2), the matrix of the plot’s attributes is then created. It should, however, be pointed out that\ndifferent cities might choose different factors according to their characteristics.\n\nFigure 2 Multifactor\nEvaluation Standard\nof Land Attributes in\nChangzhou Case\n\n1/ 2\n\nn\n2\nn\nSij = 1      {\nWk [\nFk (i )   Fk ( j ) ]\n}\n;   Wk = 1 ; i = 1, 2,  , m; j = 1, 2,  , m\nk =1\nk =1\n\n\n2.2 Relations Between Blocks Based on Their Similarities\nThe similarity coefficients between blocks can be calculated based on the multifactor evaluation of plots by the\nformula adapted from the algorithm of standard deviation:\nWhere Sij is the similarity coefficient between plot i and plot j, Fk is the various factors of the plots, n is the number of\nfactors, m is the number of plots, and Wk is the weight of various factors whose sum is 1. The system will recommend\nthe optimized weight assignment that will lead to the highest correlation between similarity coefficients and the similarity\nrelation between the existing blocks’ plot ratios. Then, a threshold is set to filter the interconnected blocks from the\nsimilarity relations between all the blocks. The matrix of interconnections is thus created which is the ground of the\ninteraction and mutual reference between blocks.\n\n2.3 Interaction and Equilibrium\nFor a pending block, the plot ratio will be iterated, referring to the values of its interconnected blocks and weighted by\ntheir similarity coefficient, which can be written as:\nm\n\nPn + 1 = Pn +\n\ni =1\n\nPi   Pn )\nSi\n(\nm\n\nWhere Pn is the plot ratio of a block after n iteration, Pn+1 is that after n+1 iteration, Pi is the plot ratio of connected\nblocks, Si is the similarity coefficient to the connected blocks, and m is the number of connected blocks. When the\nsystem tends to equilibrium, Pn+1 will be almost equal to Pn.\nFor an existing block, Pn+1 is usually different from its constant plot ratio P0, which means that the force on the block\nwhose value is “Pn+1-P0” has to counteract the interconnected blocks. So the mirror value to P0 should be used in\nthe next iteration:\n\nPn + 1 ' = 2 P 0   Pn + 1\nThus, all the interactions in the system are expressed.\nFigure 3 shows the interaction process in the case of Changzhou, where the pending blocks were flat at first and\nthen grew up and down before equilibrium was achieved. The fluctuant process of the pending blocks and the mirror\nvalue of the existing blocks are clearly demonstrated in figure 4-A and 4-B, where the plot ratios fluctuated acutely at\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n265\n\nAn Interactive Decision Support System for Deriving Plot Ratios\nBased on the Similarity Relations between Land Attributes\nFigure 3 Interaction\nProcess of the Blocks\n(Changzhou)\n\nfirst, until they tended to stabilization or invariable swings at the fourteenth iteration. The values at equilibrium are the\nrecommended plot ratios for the pending blocks on that condition.\n\n3 Parameters and Their Meanings in Urban Design\nThe system presented here is open and changing with the real-time input of the designers. All the parameters are set in\nthe panel (fig. 4-E). The plot ratio of each block may be modified according to the design intentions. Figure 4-C shows\nthe disturbance process after the plot ratio of a block was changed from 3.5 to 4.5, where several blocks attained a\nlarger plot ratio in order to reach a new equilibrium. The block’s condition may be set as “Confirmed” or “Exclusive” to\ncope with the complex issues in the planning process. “Threshold Simi.Glob.” and “Threshold Simi.Neigh.” may be set\nto control the number of interconnected blocks. Figure 4D shows the disturbance process by reducing the threshold\nat the fourteenth iteration. Besides, the weight of different factors may be assigned separately by adjusting “Factors\nWeight” in order to strengthen some special controls or intentions.\n\nConclusions\nThe interactive decision support system expressed the metabolism of urban renewal, growth referring to the existing\nblocks, and self-regulation interacting with intervention, which demonstrates the integration of design intentions\nand urban spontaneous development, and enhances the essential process of urban self-organization and heteroorganization. The software is flexible and credible in application for deriving plot ratios, which is not only the basis of\nplanning on population, transportation, land price, public facilities, etc., but also helpful for the study of 3-D urban form\nand urban design.\nThis paper described part of the research project “National Key Technology R&D Program (2006BAJ03A04\n,2006BAJ4B067) P.

Occlusion maps are shown\nhere to be an important tool for analyzing the effect that additions to existing buildings have on this perception.\nThe question is critical because additions invariably affect the visual permeability of their host buildings.\n\n1 Isovists within an environment\nWhen an existing building is entered and inhabited, views of the exterior from the interior are never total: the building\nworks like a mask or filter, selectively occluding its surroundings from its inhabitants’ view. If an addition is made to an\nexisting building, the functioning of this occlusion changes in specific ways, as old views are blocked and new ones\nare opened. To precisely examine how the visual permeability of architecture changes in such a situation requires\ncomparative tools, which explicitly register the field properties of visual perception.\nThe isovist was proposed by architect Michael Benedikt as the set of all points in an environment visible from a fixed\nstation point (Benedikt 1979), similar to Porter’s spatial boundary diagram (Porter 1979). Benedikt and subsequent\nresearchers with an interest in measuring and mapping the properties of sets of isovists (e.g., Turner and Penn 1999;\nBatty 2001; Turner et al. 2001) have tended to avoid illustrating isovists deployed throughout an environment in favor of\nillustrating the properties derived from isovist fields. Though, there exist significant exceptions to this general approach\n(e.g., Hanson 1994), as well as new investigations into three-dimensionality (e.g., Culagovski 2007).\nThis paper explores the possibility of mapping isovists deployed within an environment and identifying the potentials\nthis mapping has for the study of additions to existing buildings. To develop this possibility, the author devised a simple\nAutoLISP routine (VISMAP) for preparing plan isovists. Given a floor plan drawn in a single layer, VISMAP accepts user\ninput for grid extents and intervals, and input for the radius of an arbitrary “horizon circle.” Then, for each station point in the\ngrid, VISMAP constructs an isovist using a procedure similar to Dr. Michael Batty’s description of an agent “walking” within\nan environment (Batty 2001). This process is repeated for each station point. Figure 1 depicts the operation of VISMAP.\n\nFigure 1 Operation of\nVISMAP\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n267\n\nOn the Use of Occlusion Maps to Examine Additions to Existing\nBuildings\nFigure 2 VISMAP at the\nNational Museum of\nWestern Art, Tokyo\n\nFigure 2 shows the result of running VISMAP on an AutoCAD drawing of the main gallery floor of Le Corbusier’s National\nMuseum of Western Art (NMWA) in Tokyo. Figure 2a shows the AutoCAD drawing prior to VISMAP execution; figure 2b\nshows the result of VISMAP with the original AutoCAD drawing, displayed in grayscale for clarity.\nFigure 2b records the effect that an observer’s position in space has on his perception of the building’s visual\npermeability. This diagram is termed an occlusion map. Varying the intervals of the VISMAP grid alters the degree to\nwhich the occlusion map registers slight changes in observer position (fig. 3).\nEach of the maps in figure 3 reveals the building’s characteristic structure of visual permeability, disposed as a square\nspiral. That this structure is visible over varying grid intervals suggests that minimizing the grid interval, or setting\nthe grid with reference to “human scale,” may not be a prerequisite for disclosing important information about the\nenvironment. This counters prior research on the necessity or desirability of doing so (e.g., Turner and Penn 1999;\nBatty 2001; Turner et al. 2001).\n\n2 Applications\n\nFigure 3 Changes\nin interval\n\nFigure 4 indicates the application of VISMAP to the NMWA both before (fig. 4a) and after (fig. 4b) a major addition was\nconstructed in 1979.\nA comparison of figures 4a and 4b confirms that occlusion maps register visual permeability as a property of architecture\nthat changes with the act of addition. This property is characteristic of the environment when considered as a field. Figure\n4 demonstrates that the addition affects the perception of visual permeability throughout the field, at its perimeter, as well as\nat points well within the existing building. Changes to visual permeability are strongest in the area identified with a dashed\nline. Note how the addition reduces visibility through the window on the right side of the existing building, and how the\naddition opens a new avenue of visibility at the lower right corner of the existing building. Figure 4 suggests the possibilities\nof using the occlusion map as a tool for the design of an architectural addition: either as a means of evaluating possible\nschemes for addition by comparison, or as a target armature for design, as proposed by Benedikt (Benedikt 1979). The\n\n268\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nOn the Use of Occlusion Maps to Examine Additions to Existing\nBuildings\nuse of the occlusion map in each case demonstrates that the question of whether an addition will expand or reduce\nvisual permeability at a given point in the field is not uniformly predictable. Because the occlusion map registers for the\nenvironment as a whole the effect that an observer’s position has on his perception of architecture’s visual permeability, it\nis a powerful tool for visualizing exactly the kind of change in perception brought about by the act of addition.\nFigure 4 Before/after\naddition\n\nReferences\nBatty, M.

Recent developments in hardware have proven that such small devices are much more\ncapable and have reached the levels of common laptops as of five years ago. With more computational power, more\nmemory, and new methods of interaction such as touch screens, or accelerometers, mobile devices can be used\nin the design process.\nHowever, the assumption that they can, or will, substitute desktop computers might be misleading. By no means will\nmobile devices substitute them directly. Instead, thinking of them as innovative tools that provide new approaches\nin the design process can establish new methods and, consequently, might circumvent the overall need of desktop\ncomputers at all.\n\n1 composite Images\nOne approach that these small devices may make possible is the implementation of composite images. These systems\nare already at hand: Composing images from various sources is a long-standing technique in figurative painting and\nphotography. Today with computers, composed images are more common than unaltered images. From metadata to\noverlaid writings, almost every image carries more information than its initial visual impression.\n\n1.1 augmenting Reality\nCombining multiple images into one image, or two or more video streams into one stream, has become a technique\nknown as Augmented Reality. Images from real-world sources are combined or augmented with images from virtual\nsources. Regarding the approach of implementing composite images, to synchronize the viewing directions, two\ntechniques have emerged: either the real-world camera is based on multiple tracking devices, or systems are located\nin environments covered with markers.\nIf a camera’s position is determined completely with additional devices such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and\npositioning devices, the output device integrates the virtual augmentation directly into the viewing field of the user. Thus,\na typical application tracks both input and output devices simultaneously, as an HMD. If the system is based on markers\ntotally covering every viewing angle, like in a TV studio, the camera is bound to that place.\nNeither approach is suitable for mobile devices. The screen on a mobile device is designed as a viewfinder, not as\na display for composite images, and definitely not as an HMD. If synchronizing is performed and composite images\nare displayed, then the small display would be a simple viewer, and that would be sufficient in the architectural design\nprocess. Therefore, only basic tracking is needed.\nCovering a scene with markers is also not desired. Besides physical constraints regarding the size and number of\nmarkers, the real benefit of every outdoor system is unlimited maneuverability, and this is not afforded with the mandatory\ndeployment of at least three markers or by using calibrated or fixed cameras.\n\n270\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nComposite Images on Mobile Devices\nAugmenting Reality in an Outdoor Environment\n1.2 The existing System\nThe considerations addressed above led to the existing system. This system’s main feature is the single marker, with\nsome added tracking to permit synchronizing. Using markers always provides the best rendering results, because the\nprocess of synchronization is solely based on the image. If tracking is established, then a single marker is sufficient\nas a fiduciary feature, and processing the image is very effective because only one single feature is identified and\ninterpreted. The additional tracking is based on simple location devices on both the camera and the single marker. The\nscale of the marker, which would be a simple balloon, depends directly on the scale of the virtual model.\n\nFigure 1 and 2 Image\nProcessing and Simple\nPrototype on the iPhone\n\n1.3 Mobility\nWhile a working prototype has been under constant development for five years, mobility remains an important challenge.\nA laptop computer, a camera, and a GPS are all that was needed to establish the viewing part of the system. Most of\nthis is already available in current mobile phones. All that is missing are sufficient computational power and the ability to\ndevelop software on mobile devices, which tend to be closed environments. With the introduction of the Apple iPhone\nSoftware Developer Kit, this last hindrance is nearly removed. Our current system is presently being ported to the iPhone.\n\n2 Cell-phones and Handhelds\nMobile devices such as cell phones or handhelds are useful tools to establish communication everywhere. Only small\nbut important information were considered suitable on mobile devices. This is going to change. Recent developments\nin hardware have proven that such small devices are much more capable and can be used almost like desktop\ncomputers. However mobile devices are limited in numerous ways. They lack a real keyboard, some important\ninterfaces, and the size needed for proper manipulation. In particular, the special demands of battery-life deny the\nuse of brute-force computing. Incoming calls on a cell phone can also have bad side effects for the system. In\naddition, the demands regarding licensing and security lead to special strategies for locking parts of a mobile device’s\nfunctionality. This type of blocking has become more of an impediment to development than initially anticipated.\n\n2.1 Hardware\nA major problem is still the connection between the location device on the marker and the computer, needed to\ntransmit the marker’s position to the computer. Off-the-shelf tracking devices based on cell phone technology require\nadditional servers, and their update interval is usually not suitable for real-time composite images based on possibly\nmoving markers. Another option has emerged only recently, based on the “Zigbee”-standard. Now the 0.9 GHz band,\npreviously used for the first generation of cell phones, is open and can be used. These chips, with a range of about\nten miles, and GPS receivers are soldered on custom designed boards. However, there is no way to connect them to\na mobile device. The receiving chip is still connected to a laptop.\n\n2.2 Interface Design and Usability\nAn essential part of the system is the modeler. This still-basic tool lets users create three-dimensional models onsite. Because an overlaid image is produced and both views—the real-world and virtual views—are synchronized,\nthe virtual model appears as a realistic building in the real-world image. Every modification is immediately displayed\nas a spatial augmentation.\nOverlaid objects are part of a composite image on a touch screen. Therefore, interacting with the system by creating\nand manipulating three-dimensional shapes is essential.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n271\n\nComposite Images on Mobile Devices\nAugmenting Reality in an Outdoor Environment\nFigure 3 and 4\nBoard with Xbee-chip\nand backside with\nGPS-receiver\n\nConclusion\nDeveloping the system to augment reality through composite images (fig.1–4 and fig. 6) over some time has shown\nthat the usability of it depends mainly on its deployability. While the system already shows acceptable results on laptop\ncomputers, mobile devices are much more desirable. In theory, they can handle all requests. In practice, the technology\npresented here is still under development. Namely, accessing the marker and its positioning device from a mobile\ndevice is a significant problem. Performance and usability are still issues on both platforms.\nThe vision remains: With mobile devices, new forms of design are imaginable. Augmenting real-world scenes with\nvirtual, three-dimensional models permits immediate alternate designs. Given that one of the strengths of cell phones\nis communication, a rapid design process is thinkable.\n\nReferences (selected)\nAnders, P. (1999).

BIM platforms such as Autodesk’s\nRevit can associate meta-data to objects, providing the design team with the ability to track project information such\nas costs, material quantities, supplier information, etc.\nBIM data sets are often large, requiring a powerful computer and thousands of dollars of software to experience the\ndata in its native format. The data lives solely on the designer’s machine or his local network. Porting a model to another\nuser’s machine, or accessing any part of the model data in a casual context, such as a meeting, is difficult. Until access\nto BIM data is easier and more intuitive than using paper documents, widespread BIM adoption will be a challenge.\nAt the same time that BIM has gained prominence in the AEC community, mobile handset manufacturers and\ncellular network providers have been crafting ever more powerful, network-capable mobile devices. With ample\nstorage, intuitive interfaces, and large communities of developers, these devices can be seriously considered as\nplatforms to access both the geometric and database components of a BIM model. Using a mobile device with\na BIM browsing application, one could simultaneously navigate a three-dimensional representation of the model,\nselect and mark up elements, and pull off material quantities, all while participating in a conference call or sitting\non an airplane.\nThis paper summarizes the development of goBIM, a model viewer, markup, and data-querying environment that\nutilizes Apple’s iPhone and Autodesk’s Revit software. Geometric and database information are written to a userdefined server location via a custom Revit plugin. Model geometry and database information are loaded at run-time\nfrom the web server to the goBIM iPhone application, using a cellular network connection or WiFi. The user can\nthen navigate the 3D environment, selecting objects to view their associated database information. The user has\nthe ability to tag elements in the model with additional data, which can then be pushed back to the server and\nreloaded in the local version of the Revit model. BIM data can now be accessed anywhere there is a WiFi or cellular\nnetwork connection available.\ngoBIM is an intuitive, cost-effective collaboration tool, but it has limitations. The speed of the iPhone processor\nand data network make it difficult to load large models.\ngoBIM is a small step towards providing members of the AEC community with a portable, effective device for\nutilizing and extending their BIM data.\n\n1 Technology Overview\nThe goBIM application comprises two pieces of software. The first is a plug-in for Autodesk Revit 2010, the “goBIM Exporter.”\nThe second is an iPhone application for viewing the exported model data, the “goBIM Application.” The methodologies\ndescribed herein could also be applied to other BIM software or hand-held devices capable of 3D visualization.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n273\n\ngoBIMTM:\nBIM Review for the iPhone\nIn the “goBIM Pipeline” section, I will describe the four steps necessary to export Revit object data and to visualize and\ninteract with the data on the iPhone. The technologies involved in implementing each step of the pipeline are outlined,\nand descriptions of the challenges that were faced in these implementations are provided.\nThe final section outlines the next steps and conclusions in the development of goBIM.\n\n2 The goBIM Pipeline\nThe goBIM pipeline can be broken down into the following four steps:\n1. Export: The export of a text file containing the geometric and database information, as well as an image file\nrepresenting the light map\n• Data Gathering: The acquisition of mesh geometry and associated data from objects in the Revit interface\n• Rendering: The cleanup of the mesh information, the parameterization of the mesh, and the rendering of lighting\nand textures to a light map\n2. Reassembly: The downloading and reconstruction of the model at run-time\n3. Interaction and Markup: The methods of interaction with the model, the addition of tagged information to model\nelements, and the uploading of this data to the server\n4. BIM Update: The updating of the BIM model in Revit with information added in the goBIM application\n\n3 Export\nSelecting the “Export to goBIM” button in Revit presents users with a dialogue where they can specify the name and\nthe location of the local export files. Users can also specify a server address for their file, providing username and\npassword parameters. As the rendering process can take quite some time, users are allowed to disable the “Render\nWith SunFlow” option. The goBIM process is designed to work on a separate thread from the Revit application,\nenabling users to continue their Revit work while goBIM renders and exports their model. The mesh and light map files\nare exported as:\nMODEL_NAME.gbm\nMODEL_NAME.png\n\nData Gathering\nThe goBIM exporter takes advantage of Revit’s open API. Although tested using Revit Structure 2010, the API is shared\nacross Autodesk’s Revit suite, enabling users to export to goBIM in Revit Building, Revit Structure, or Revit Systems.\nThe goBIM Exporter is written using C#. The choice of C# as the programming language was predicated on the desire\nto have a consistent language across all the technologies involved in the development of goBIM. Unity3D (UNITY:\nGame Development Tool), the game engine chosen to develop the goBIM Application, offers a C# scripting engine\nbased on Mono, a cross-platform implementation of .Net (Main Page - Mono n/d). With this common language, code\ncould be developed and reused between the goBIM Exporter and the goBIM Application.\nThe model data is gathered in two components: the Revit elements’ mesh and the database info associated with\nthose elements. The B-Rep definition that Revit utilizes for its geometry is not compatible with a game engine, but\nthe triangulated mesh representation of each Revit element is exposed through the API. Further, Revit allows users\nto define three levels of detail for solid bodies. The highest resolution is used for visualizing the geometry in the Revit\ninterface, while the lowest resolution is used for diagrammatic views of centerline elements used in structural steel plans\nor mechanical single-line drawings. The medium mesh resolution can be used here to define a level of resolution for a\nsolid object acceptable in goBIM. The size of the mesh becomes critically important as goBIM, on the first-generation\niPhone, has an approximate limit to the geometry that it can effectively render of seven to ten thousand mesh faces.\n\nExporting the Mesh:\nThe Revit meshes must be optimized for efficient export. In a triangulated Revit mesh, triangles on adjacent faces do\nnot share vertices. By “welding” these vertices and rewriting the face index list, users can define a “seamless” mesh.\nSeamlessness is a prerequisite for parameterization: the act of determining texture coordinates for mesh vertices. The\nmesh is automatically split and texture coordinates are defined for each vertex, using methods described by A. Hardy\nand H. Steeb in “Mathematical Tools in Computer Graphics with C# Implementations” (Hardy, Steeb 2008). The texture\ncoordinates are necessary during the rendering phase of the pipeline, and will be discussed in the next section.\nTwo stages are necessary in the mesh export. The first stage exports each Revit object as a separate mesh that can be\ntranslated into discrete game objects in Unity3D. Each goBIM game object can then hold the mesh geometry, associated\ndata, and material information for a single Revit element. By processing the geometry in this way however, I regularly\nexceeded the hardware’s maximum number of draw calls in Unity3D. For a more explicit description of draw calls, users\n\n274\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\ngoBIMTM:\nBIM Review for the iPhone\ncan refer to the OpenGL specification (OpenGL - The Industry Standard for High Performance Graphics n/d). Unity3D\nuses frustrum culling to decide which objects are to be drawn in the view. For this reason, it is advantageous for users to\nkeep close to the model so that their field of view contains as few elements as possible. As the scene is reconstituted in\nUnity3D, the scene-bounding box is calculated and the users’ movements are constrained to within those bounds.\nThe second stage combines all the element meshes into one monolithic mesh in order to reduce rendering time. Each\nof the individual meshes has its UV coordinates fit into one large chart that represents the entire mesh. Using a circular\nparameterization routine, the resulting texture coordinates can be easily nested into a square map as seen in figure 1. The\nmethodology for “packing” this chart is discussed in the next section.\nThe mesh information is structured in our .gbm file similarly to the .obj file format. It includes vertex, face index, and texture\ncoordinate information formatted as:\nv#X_COORD#Y_COORD#Z_COORD\nvt#U_COORD#V_COORD\nf#IND_1/TEXT_IND_1#IND_2/TEXT_IND_2#IND_3/TEXT_IND_3\nid#UNIQUE_ID\n\nExporting the Data:\nFor simplicity in the creation of the goBIM prototype, the .gbm file is a formatted text file, located on a public server. Each\nRevit element’s data field is output as:\n#p#REVIT_ID#PARAM_NAME#PARAM_VALUE\nThis simple formatting is effective and still allows users to conduct queries in the goBIM application such as:\n• Sum the number of elements of a particular type.\n• Sum the volume of a particular material in all building elements.\n• Sum the area of certain elements.\nRevit also contains levels that are each written to the .gbm file as:\nl#LEVEL_NAME#LEVEL_ELEVATION\nFuture versions of the software will need to implement the secure transfer of database information.\n\nRendering\nTo give depth and material quality to the model in the goBIM Application, lighting and shading can be calculated\nduring export. The lighting and shading can then be “baked” to an image file or “light map.” The open-source SunFlow\nrendering engine (Sunflow - Global Illumination Rendering System n/d) was chosen for its ability to bake lighting and\ntextures to an image file. Written in Java, the engine uses a text file as input to the rendering process. The goBIM\nExporter creates this text file, setting up lighting, material, and render settings, and calls the SunFlow process externally.\nThe progress of the rendering process is output to the goBIM export dialogue.\nThe size of the rendered light map was chosen as 1024 x 1024 pixels, as this is the largest texture size that can be\nused on the iPhone. Accordingly, the UV domain of each mesh was then refit to this 1024 square by rounding up the\nsquare of the total number of elements to the nearest integer, and then dividing 1024 by this result to yield the size of\neach element’s UV domain. For example, figure 1 shows a grid containing 272 elements:\nSQRT(272) = 16.49 ->17.\n17*17 = 289.\n1024/289 = 60.23 pixels (domain size)\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n275\n\ngoBIMTM:\nBIM Review for the iPhone\nThe unfortunate side effect of using one light map is that as the number of elements exported grows, each object’s\narea within the large UV domain becomes smaller, thereby reducing the resolution of the lighting and shading in that\narea. Additionally, large complex meshes occupy an area of the domain equivalent to small, simple meshes. This can\nbe solved in a future version by creating a series of light maps that represent subsets of the exported objects grouped\nby size, or by using a more sophisticated parameterization technique such as ABF++(Sheffer, et. al. 2005).\nIn order to visualize the results of the light mapping process, I created an additional piece of software called Jungle\nusing OpenTK (OpenTK | Home of the Open Toolkit library n/d). OpenTK is a .Net wrapper for OpenGL. Jungle was\nuseful for visualizing our optimized meshes with their associated light map textures, testing OpenGL draw calls, and\ndeveloping classes to load our proprietary .gbm files. Jungle is shown in figure 2.\n\n4 Reassembly\nIn order to load a model in the goBIM\nApplication, the user’s iPhone must\nbe connected to a data network.\nThe author’s development of goBIM\nwas conducted on a first-generation\niPhone, using available WiFi networks\nor the standard AT&T data network.\nThe standard data network is extremely\nslow to load anything but the smallest\nmodels. Newer versions of the iPhone\nthat offer 3G network capability and\nfaster processors should decrease load\ntimes measurably but were not available\nfor testing at the time of publication.\nFortunately, the increasing ubiquity of\nWiFi access and the availability of faster\niPhone hardware all but guarantee\nthat goBIM’s model loading times will\ncontinue to decrease.\nA model loading script was written for\nUnity3D, which handles the reading of\nthe .gbm file and the reassembly of the model at run-time. The model meshes are re-created from the .gbm file, and\nUnity3D creates new game objects with blank texture information. The light map image is then read and applied to the\nimage channel of each game object’s material, creating the illusion of light and shadow.\n\nFigure 2\nThe Jungle application\nviewing a .idf file.\n\nFigure\n2. ThetheJungle\napplication\na .idf\nWhen an object is selected in the goBIM\nApplication,\nassociated\ndata is pulled viewing\nfrom the arrays\nand file.\npresented in\na list.\nLevels read from the .gbm file are re-created as infinite collision planes, located at their respective elevations in the\ngoBIM Application.\n\n5 Interaction\nThe goBIM Application uses a “walk-through” approach to interaction with the model. The virtual thumbsticks at the\nlower left and lower right (fig. 3) control translation and look direction, respectively. Objects can be selected by simply\ntouching the object on the screen. To move up or down a level, the user touches ‘+’ or ‘-’ in the UI. Future versions of\ngoBIM will allow “arcball” manipulation similar to most 3D modeling applications.\nThe user is able to select an object for markup. An on-screen keyboard is provided with a text field for the user to\nprovide additional comments on a selected object. Currently, the addition of data on objects is limited to comments.\nWhen the model is synched back to Revit, the comments will appear on the objects in the “goBIM_Comments” field.\n\nConclusions\ngoBIM is structured such that future versions with other BIM applications will require only the creation of an exporter\nfor that software. Every modeling application with an API provides access to the mesh representation of the model\ngeometry. Platforms that have been considered include Digital Project, Bentley Microstation, and Rhino.\nAlthough the functionality of goBIM is currently limited to the display of the 3D model and select, tagged data, future\nversions of the goBIM tool could include other layers of building information, including sunlight studies, environmental\nanalysis results, and post-occupancy data.\n\n276\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\ngoBIMTM:\nBIM Review for the iPhone\n\nThe WiFi and GPS capabilities of the iPhone could be extended in future versions of goBIM to allow augmented site\nvisits. Instead of users navigating to an object in the model for inspection, users’ locations on-site could be determined\nby WiFi and GPS, and their location in the model could be set accordingly. Using the iPhone’s camera, the user could\ntake\na snapshot,\nwhichUser\ncould be\ntagged to the user’s exact location and time and uploaded to Revit as a markup.\nFigure\n3. goBIM\nInterface\nThe newest version of the iPhone SDK allows for the creation of local networks. A “multi-player” version of goBIM would\nallow browsing and coordination between multiple parties in real time.\nExtensions to the hardware capabilities of the iPhone could allow the user to scan RFID tags or barcodes and find\nthe associated elements in the model, or the goBIM Application could be used as a control device for a Building\nManagement System.\nEven the small goBIM feature set available as of this writing provides a window into the possibilities of this technology.\nIncreases in processor and network speed will allow for the loading of larger models, and the integration of full database\nquerying capabilities will increase the richness of the goBIM Application experience.\nWhen the BIM model can escape the confines of the user’s desktop machine, we will finally unlock the capabilities of\nBIM and provide a new level of transparency and coordination in the building process.\nRevit Structure, Revit Building, and Revit Systems are trademark Autodesk Inc.\nUnity3d is trademark Unity Technologies ApS.\n\nReferences\n“UNITY: Game Development Tool.” UNITY: Game Development Tool. 20 July 2009 <http://unity3d.com>.\n“Main Page - Mono.” Main Page - Mono. 20 July 2009 <http://mono-project.com/Main_Page>.\nA.

Johnson\nUniversity of Washington, Design Machine Group\n\nAbstract\nWidespread use by 3D designers of simple digital modeling applications such as Google’s SketchUp may displace\nthe use of physical models in design. However, the difficulties often faced by non-experts in the ad hoc navigation of\ndigital models during design reviews have not been eliminated. Keyboards and mice are clumsy navigational devices\nand difficult to share in a collaborative setting.\nThis work explores the combination of new, inexpensive interface hardware technologies with a popular 3D modeler in\norder to create a viable surrogate for physical models. Two architectural model navigation and presentation interfaces\nwere developed, one based on an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) circuit board (“Gizmo”), and one that used a Wii\nRemote Controller (“WiiView”). Both were interfaced with the popular architectural modeling program SketchUp.\nAnecdotal responses and preliminary user testing results are presented.\n\n1 Introduction\nPhysical models typically accompany architectural design presentations. Participants are able to manipulate the model\nand acquire particular views, as they choose. The adoption of 3D digital modeling often suggests that physical models\nwill be eliminated and that 3D views will be reduced to pre-selected viewpoints or animations.\nUnfortunately, many issues remain in the navigation of 3D digital models, particularly architectural models, for which\ninterior views may well be as important as exterior views. The habitual use of the mouse, key board, and windows for\ninteraction obscures their clumsiness when interacting with 3D models. Most applications used for 3D modeling have\nuser interfaces that are involved with hiding or momentarily avoiding inconvenient geometry. The common user interfaces\nmake the exact placement or definition of a viewpoint for rendering an exacting, frustrating process for experienced\nusers, and a near hopeless one for inexperienced users. This work is an attempt to apply new technologies to this very\nold problem.\n\n1 Prior Work\n1.1“Nobody Walks in Virtual Reality—”\n“They all fly,” as Chuck Blanchard reportedly said in a conference presentation (Hays, 1983). There is extensive literature\ncovering virtual reality navigational methods (Bowman, Koller, and Hodges 1997; Mackinlay, Card and Robertson\n1990), but little of it has been applied to widely used 3D modeling systems; instead, wheel mice and keyboards are\nthe dominant tools. The most common mode of operation involves heavy use of zoom, pan, and orbit, combined with\nconcealing and revealing parts of the model through the control of “layers,” hide/reveal commands, and transparency.\nArchitectural presentations that involve “walk-throughs” and “fly-throughs” are generally scripted and often precomputed.\nThe difficulty of ad hoc navigation is that it shuts out largely inexperienced users, and the single locus of control makes\nit difficult to share or perform navigations during a discussion.\n\n278\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nGizmo & WiiView:\nTangible User Interfaces Enabling Architectural Presentations\n1.2 Tangible navigation technologies\nOur devices are very similar to (though much less expensive than) the “Bat” (Ware and Jessome 1988). Architectural\ndesign has occasionally been a subject of tangible interface research: the Cubic Mouse (Fröhlich et al. 2000) and the\n“two-4-six” (Kulik, Fröhlich, and Blach 2006) are related most directly to our work.\nFigure 1 & 2\nGizmo (left) and\nWiiView (right)\n\n2 Discussion of work\nThe incorporation of standard wireless interfaces such as Bluetooth and the widespread availability of MEMs\naccelerometers and rotation sensors have produced a new class of untethered interface devices, and invite exploration\nof programs such as SketchUp that expose appropriate APIs. We experimented with two of them: a robotics inertial\nmeasurement unit (IMU) nicknamed “Gizmo” (fig. 1), and a Nintendo Wii Remote Controller called WiiView (fig. 2.) For\neach device, we developed a set of gestures to control the SketchUp “camera” viewpoint (figs 3, 4).\nFigure 3 & 4\nGizmo and WiiView:\nGestures\n\n2.1 Preliminary User Testing\nOne of our developers used Gizmo as a tool for developing a geometric model of the interior of our laboratory space. He\nfound that for judging the quality and correctness of his interior model, and for placing viewpoints for lighting simulation,\nit was far preferable to a mouse and the usual SketchUp tools; it let him go inside the space in ways in which those\ntools did not easily support.\nTime and the preliminary nature of the software did not allow for extensive formal user testing of the devices, but we did\nhave three architecture students and one professor run a modest test. We downloaded from Google’s 3D warehouse a\nmodel of a small three-story office with a full complement of furniture and interior finishes, and had our participants count\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n279\n\nGizmo & WiiView:\nTangible User Interfaces Enabling Architectural Presentations\nthe chairs on three floors, one with a mouse, one with Gizmo, and one with the Wii Remote and our WiiView software.\nThe results were interesting but mixed; there was a tendency for testers to fly out through the walls.\nThe following table summarizes the numerical results of the count:\nTable 1 Chair counting test results\nDEVICE\n\nMouse\n\nGizmo\n\nWiimote\n\nPercentage of chairs found\n\n81%\n\n64%\n\n47%\n\n2.2 Some Notes & Observations\n1) User tests closer to the intended application of each device’s domain, design, and design review would probably\nproduce data that is more interesting.\n2) Some of the testers commented positively on the lack of a “roll” motion (turning on the axis of the line of sight). Our\nown experience with architectural model navigation suggests that, for most navigational purposes, roll is more of a\nhindrance than a help.\n3) Users immediately associated the turning of Gizmo with the turning of the model displayed on the screen; users\nwho used Gizmo tried to turn the Wii Remote.\n4) The WiiView software appears to make it possible to control “fly” very well.\n5) The Wii Remote’s buttons were a great advantage; their multiplicity also turned out to be a source of confusion.\n6) Subjects did not use SketchUp’s own mouse-based “walk” and “turn” tools, though we did not forbid them to do so.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND DIRECTIONS\nBoth Gizmo and WiiView are interesting and attractive; we hope to deploy them in a studio review in the future. In our opinion\nthe greatest successes of this experiment were the simple integration of easily available, moderately priced devices into a\nwidely used design tool, and the clear relation between operator motion and the motion in the model. At times, this relation\nappeared to invoke directly the perceptions and responses involved in walking and looking. Yet, limiting the device to that type\nof cognition alone made the interface more difficult; Gizmo’s complete lack of buttons limited gestural vocabulary significantly.\n\nREFERENCES\nBowman, D.

The simple translation of this is that architects make drawings, models, computer\nsimulations, and the like for the ultimate purpose of making a building. This work challenges the notion that architects\nmake only representation media, and expands the role of architecture to include mediation as an act upon a space that\nis both physical and analytical.\nWhat if architects make, but they don’t make for the end result of a building? What if architects make representations\nthat are physical and experiential, and that are designed and built without the presumption of a building? This is the\nspace that middleware occupies.\n\n1 Introduction\nFigure 1 Intermediary\ndefined space for the\nCompu-Kinetic Mediapod\n\nDigital media exploration typically lacks a physical presence—the work\nis done on a computer screen, and its space is the flat plane of that\nscreen. One of the architectural intentions within this experiment is to\nexplore the physicality of media. The physical work can be considered\na commentary on the lack of architecture in contemporary architectural\ndiscourse—especially digital architectural discourse. The project acts as\na prototype or a testing area to investigate the physical relationship of\nmedia and the space the body inhabits. This Compu-Kinetic Mediapod\nwas produced for a space in order to define the space and the act in the\nspace. The Mediapod and its environment provide a temporal place for\none to engage media.\nThe frame of the Compu-Kinetic Mediapod is built out of steel, while the\nintricate moving parts are built from stainless steel. Upon this frame rests\nthe digital and mechanical devices that move in response to the inhabitant\nand the audience. As a participant changes from audience member\nto inhabitant, his/her effect on the piece becomes more physical. The\ninhabitant must lower the chair and, in turn, triggers many events (figs.\n1–4). One event is the lowering of the computer display from the height\nof the standing audience to the height of the seated viewer. Another event\nis the Flash animation that is presented on the display. This animation is\nmanipulated by mechanical switches that trigger events within Flash, as\nwell as by motion detectors that register not only the inhabitant as he/she\nengages the piece, but also the audience as they move; the more active the\nmovement, the more active the Flash animation.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n281\n\nCompu-Kinetic Mediapod\n\nFigure 2 Compu-Kinetic\nMediapod expanded to\nfit in space; positioned in\nnon-interactive mode\nFigure 3\nCompu-Kinetic Mediapod\nsensing the participant\n\nFilmstrips are also attached to the Mediapod. These film sequences depict the theoretical underpinnings of the project.\nThe first filmstrip contains a very early inspiration for the form of the media pod. A second filmstrip shows the elegance and\nergonomics of the current computer. Finally, a third filmstrip responds to the many agricultural/Midwestern influences in the\ndevice. Surrounding the Mediapod is a wall of curtains. The main purpose of this wall is to define an intermediate space\nfor the device and to separate the device from its environment. The curtain makes reference to both a theatrical curtain as\nwell as a material reminiscent of grain sacks, which are used for agricultural purposes.\n\n2 Middleware as Spectacle\nThe initial working title for this Compu-Kinetic Mediapod was “Spectacular\nSpectacular,” a term gleaned from the movie Moulin Rouge. This stemmed from\nthe desire to deal with media physically, but also for it to be a spectacle or focal\npoint that would attract a participant. How one interacts with media is, in the end,\na physical relationship: one must touch the keyboard and the mouse, and one’s\nhead position relative to the viewing screen is important. Humans relate with media\non display in various ways; recent technology has allowed television to be viewed\non a wide array of displays from iPods to the traditional television set and in many\ndifferent relationships with the human body from on your lap to high above on\nthe wall. The structure for the Compu-Kinetic Mediapod began with the idea that\none’s engagement with media is a body/space relationship which is ultimately an\narchitectural relationship,. The desire to make this piece a spectacle required that\nthe program for the Mediapod go beyond a glorified computer holding device;\nit had to address the physical relationship a body and an audience has with an\nobject such as this. In addition, the person had to be located such that he/she\ncould interact with the device and, thus, sensors had to engage the various ways\nthat a human might interact with the device.\nThere is a rich history of interactive and kinetic sculptures by artists such as Rube\nGoldberg and Nam June Paik, and even Laszlo Moholy-Nagy from the Bauhaus\nperiod experimented in movement and light. The Compu-Kinetic Mediapod was\nconstructed to intrigue the participant by engaging him/her with the spectacle of\nits performance. As in the movie Moulin Rouge, the title preceded the product,\nwith only the event of making it and the process undergone in its evolution left\nto determine what the “Spectacular Spectacular” really was. In other words, this\nproject began without knowing what it would become, and with no prescriptive needs (a very difficult way to work\nbecause no limits are placed upon the project). Prior to its current program, the project’s only initial purpose was to be a\nspectacle; its purpose was to be physical and engaging. With the benefit of hindsight, it is much more than a spectacle,\nwhile it maintains the power of being a performance in process. By being in process, it suggests an indeterminate\nend. In other words, the story continues to develop; the ways in which the Compu-Kinetic Mediapod may engage the\nparticipant may evolve and become more advanced and, potentially, more personal.\n\n282\n\nFigure 4 Compu-Kinetic\nMediapod engaged by\na user\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nCompu-Kinetic Mediapod\n\n3 Middleware as Architecture\nThe making of the Compu-Kinetic Mediapod had to relate with much more than merely something to hold a computer\nscreen or manage cables that connect computer devices. Because the final form was not known, nor what peripherals\nor equipment would be required, the construction had to have a framework that could adapt. As with a building, a\nstructural framework provided the necessary flexibility and strength. A simple telephone pole—a conduit for media—\ninspired the chosen system. Furthermore, that its final location would be in a university building required that the\nMediapod be able to be installed without penetrating or disrupting the university facility. A compression-expansion\nmechanism was employed to take advantage of the honeycomb grid of the ceiling. Essentially, the device, when put\ninto place, expands, therefore, compressing the structure between the floor and the ceiling. This method responds to\nthe temporality and portability of media.\nThe only place where the participant must engage the device by touch is in the chair. Notably, the chair is a vintage tractor\nseat rather than a modern chair. The use of this has many meanings—one is the anti-technology that it represents,\nanother is the materiality of steel and the simplicity of form, while yet another may be the surprising level of comfort of\nsuch a rigid material.\nThe mechanism that holds the seat and allows it to raise and lower holds a relationship to the can-can dancer depicted\nin Moulin Rouge. It is as if the machine is doing a high leg kick with one foot firmly planted on the floor—a technique\nused by the dancer to invade another’s personal space. This mechanism is also much like the complexity of landing\ngear and the mechanisms involved to make it both expand and contract in a compact manner. No matter what the\ninterpretation, the purpose is to connect the device to the user visually, physically, and intimately. Ultimately, this is the\nact of architecture.\n\nReferences\nDollens, Dennis. D•2•A Digital to Analog.

Working with sketched lines,\nhandcrafted finishing, geometric overlay, and tool path coding can lead a designer to unexpected results. Concentrating\non forming processes moving through material over time encourages open-ended play. Iteratively examining how\ncomputer operations generate carved results provides a craftsman’s understanding of tools and materials.\n\n1 Introduction\nOur carving experiments fall into the realm of craft, a humble activity that involves the use of tools in shaping materials for\naesthetic and functional purposes. This paper uses lessons learned from CNC carving to illuminate how a craft orientation\ncan enrich digital fabrication. It builds on architect Luis Eduardo Boza’s (2006) idea that the automated “Workmanship\nof Certainty,” as defined by furniture designer David Pye in 1968, can be invigorated with the “Workmanship of Risk.” It\ndiscusses ways to introduce this risk so that it brings the delight of serendipity.\n\n284\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nSerendipity and Discovery in a Machine Age: Craft and a\nCNC Router\n2 HAND-DRAWN LIGHT\nMODULATING SCREENS\nLike many, we are eager to escape the\nmonotonous regularity of automated repetition.\nOne method we employed was to use handdrawn lines as a generator to create panels\nwith surfaces and apertures vary with changing\nlight. This was inspired by Digitiles (Breen\n& Stellingwerff 2007) and algorithmic holes\n(Bonwetsch et al. 2007).\nWe took gestural sketches created with\nan Anoto digital pen into 3D modeling and\nthen carved them with the router. Outlines\nsimplified and closed with Adobe Illustrator\nretained the random idiosyncrasies created\nby the physiology of the hand (Von Sommers\n1984). The impulse to use hand-drawn lines is\nakin to the relief sketchy rendering and digital\nrust techniques provide from the slickness\nof photorealistic rendering. Departing from\nBezier curve precision takes the work out\nof the realm of pure geometry. Like variablewidth brushstrokes in vector-based illustration,\na hand-drawn line’s gestural expression can\nhave an idiosyncratic vitality that can satisfy in a\ndifferent way than geometric resolution.\nIn figure 1 (left), flat, sketched loops become\ndeep funnels that reveal the depth of the wood.\nIt is true to the line drawing, yet completely\ntransformed by the machine. Stair steps are\nvisible both in depth and at the perimeter of\nthe parallel tool marks. Waveforms in figure 1\n(center) highlight the variable angle of the wood\ngrain with irregular fuzziness.\n\nFigure 2\nColumns created from\nrepeating and rotating\na spiral tool path by\nHegre. Each carving\nresulted from modifying\nthe machine code of the\nprevious one.\n\nThe signature quality of hand-drawn lines\ncan invigorate a digital project. An accessible\ndigitizing pen allows quick input of vector lines\nthat can be easily transformed for 2D cutting\nand 3D form generation (lofting, Boolean\noperations, etc.). This produces more creative variations than 3D modeling, whose complex interfaces trigger linear\nrational thinking, constraining creativity.\nBut hand-drawn lines are limited. They do not gracefully spawn related forms; they lack defined geometric relationships.\nFor example, loosely drawn circles and ellipses have no centers for generating concentric forms. Looped or kinked lines\ncan generate problematic surfaces that cannot easily be offset. And while excessive rehearsal or editing can temper\nspontaneity in sketched lines, they can still be more interesting than geometrically precise curves.\n\n3 TOOLPATH MANIPULATIONS\nCo-author Erik Hegre investigated how a CNC router with a 4th axis uses movement to generate form. Playing with\nG-code, Hegre observed the results of incremental code changes on machine movement, and documented the\nphysical results. This allowed him to emulate gestures in the language of the machine. The column variations started\nwith a simple spiral path, generated by rotating the cylinder while moving a router bit along its length, like a lathe creating\na bolt thread. As Hegre methodically divided motions into smaller increments and adjusted variables (i.e., rotation, axial\ndistance, height), he created a family of forms.\nAs in a chess game, each step was chosen by looking at the set of previous steps. The process developed a strong\nfeedback loop between the emerging form and the machine code used to generate it. Then, the designer and coauthor Erik Hegre, used visual judgment to enhance the next machine operation. From a quantity of data aspect, both\nof these examples used the smallest amount of information needed to create a larger effect—the tool bit and tool path\nare perfectly optimized to generate the emerging form.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n285\n\nSerendipity and Discovery in a Machine Age: Craft and a\nCNC Router\nWe may be able to discover new horizons in design by utilizing simple methods, making modifications, and seeking\nunique results. Margaret Wertheim (2009), whose Institute for Figuring network is crocheting coral reef geometry,\nargues that even “the highest levels of abstraction...can be engaged with, not just through purely cerebral algebraic\nsymbolic methods, but by literally, physically playing with ideas.”\n\n4 ANALYSIS: Motion and Play as Paths to Discovery\nWe can explore actions, as opposed to pre-conceived form, through sketching, finishing, and coding. These activities\nprecede process as a driver of design and encourage playful experimentation. Rather than the question, how can the\ntool make my form? We need to ask, what can this tool make? And, how can I tool towards interesting form?\nDesigning with physical engagement can foster the mind-to-hand connection, broadening crafting knowledge and\nmaterial understanding. Sociologist Richard Sennett argues that as designers stray from hand drawing, they will lose\na connection to their work. Using the machine as an extension of our hand, we can empathetically experience its\nmovements, while benefiting from the machine’s precision and ability to replicate. The medium records both hand and\nmachine tool movements as memory traces or engrams.\nWe want our community to enrich digital precision with the knowledge and serendipity of handcraft. By pursuing the\nsensitivity of handcraft without its labor, we can use digital fabrication as a catalyst for design instead of just a means\nof production. Our explicit interest in the hand-drawn line, material properties, and tool path motion has allowed us to\nexpose playful design opportunities. Each product’s meaning comes from a specific context. They may look trivial to the\nobserver, but to the creator, they act as a means of discovery. As playing with chains and weights was a first step for\nAntonio Gaudi’s catenary vaults, we hope these exercises plant seeds for ideas that come to fruition later.\n\nReferences\nBonwetsch, Tobias, Ralph Bärtschi, Daniel Kobel, Fabio Gramazio, and Matthias Kohler, (2007). “Digitally Fabricating\nTilted Hole.” Proceedings from eCAADe Frankfurt am Main (Germany), 26–29 September 2007, pp. 793–799.\nBoza, Luis Eduardo (2006). “(Un) Intended Discoveries Crafting the Design Process.” In Synthetic Landscapes, pp.\n150–157.

The\npaper describes a novel approach to conducting An Inconvenient Studio and the unique learning experience that led to\noriginal active and reactive inventions. Situated technologies / physical computing played a central role in enabling An\nInconvenient Studio. Five projects that came out of the studio will be briefly described: Legobotics, Bloom, Twist, Arcus\nAnimus, and Morpholuminescence.\n\n1 Introduction\nThe prospects of climate change loom over the horizon of our generation (Pachuari and Reisinger 2007). The daunting task\nof reigning in risk factors for cataclysmic climate change requires that we think outside the silos of education, pedagogy, and\nknowledge creation and embrace innovation through design (Mau 2007). In spring 2009, a studio was conducted at Ball\nState University with an aim to innovate through active strategies in environmental design (in distinction to passive design),\ndigital technologies, robotics, interactive architecture, and collaborative design approaches that challenge conventional\nmodels of studio education. Known by many names (interactive architecture, responsive architecture, smart environments,\nintelligent buildings, situated technologies, and robotic architecture), these new technologies hold tremendous promise for\nthe future of architecture (Cook et al. 2005; Guin et al. 1986).\nThe studio was given an opportunity to self-organize and operate around a self-defined mission and brand, as well as a set\nof advanced technologies and design topics. Inconveniently, no preconceived design projects were given to the students.\nNo deadlines were provided. Instead, a vertical studio consisting of thirteen graduate and undergraduate students and\ntwo instructors was turned into an entrepreneurial think tank (inconvenient studio 2009), with an organizational structure\nthat evolved through practical as well as academic needs. The students were asked to come up with projects and project\ntime lines through collective dialog, exploration, and consensus, as well as to develop and choose roles for themselves for\ntasks such as direction, fundraising, archiving and recording work, and public relations. The studio needed to be an agile\nand adaptive organization to maximize its reliance on the collective intelligence—identifying problems through research and\ndeveloping proposed solutions through design. As an organization, the studio was allowed to consider failure and conflict\nas inherent conditions of any system. Instead of handling them top-down, the studio was permitted to go through the\nnatural cycles of learning from failure and conflict resolution as part of the learning process.\n\n2 Self-organizing Studio without Boundaries\nThe studio established no firm boundaries that would fiercely distinguish institutional interiority from non-institutional\nexteriority. Hence, the studio has functioned as a network without boundaries, expanding the reach of the institution and\nembracing the larger world into the fold of knowledge creation. In this sense, the group was seen as an organizational\nstructure as a collective possessing a “design intelligence,” which is enabled by communication, information, and design\ntechnologies to innovate, not only architectural projects, but the architecture of ideas, processes, techniques, and\nmaterials (Speaks 2002). Managing the complexities of a holistic process for designing that fosters team-oriented and\nmultidisciplinary design innovation in a complexly connected world requires that academia and design firms embrace new\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n287\n\nAn Inconvenient Studio\ntechnologies and organizational experiments (Steele 2006; Erdman et al. 2006). All members of the think tank were\nencouraged to leverage ideas, people, and learning from anywhere in the world through their individual networks. The\nstudio benefited from many alignments with multidisciplinary and external collaborators, as portions of this “inconvenient”\nstudio were taught in collaboration with the BSU Institute for Digital Fabrication, CASE Design, University of Waterloo, and\nPratt Institute.\n\n3 Projects\n3.1 Legobotics\nInitial knowledge building began through structured play exercises—brief open-ended provocations were provided,\nfollowed by making and testing, and finally, “playful” demonstrations of the “works-in-progress”—all in very quick fashion.\nAt the beginning, in the spirit of iterative prototyping, experimenting, and failing, the studio was tasked to explore the\ncreation of prototypes, or “Legobots,” that could behave according to a small set of stimuli and rules. LEGO NXT kits\nwere useful for developing these prototypes quickly—the kits have pre-designed connection systems and are easily\nassembled, modular, re-configurable, and packaged with sensors, microcontrollers, and actuators that are all driven with\na visual programming interface. Failures were abundant as the students quickly found the limitations of these kits. For\ninstance, the sensing ranges for light, sound, and proximity had to first be discovered, and then carefully controlled by\nadjusting the physical location and direction of the sensors, as well as by calibrating and fine-tuning the programming.\nIn these cases, physical prototyping proved to be the critical method driving the design and innovation process. Most, if not\nall, of the design changes and development occurred through the building, testing, and modifying of full-working prototypes.\n\n3.2 Bloom\nOne such project, titled “Bloom,” sought to blur the distinction between canopy and enclosure with the opening and closing\nof lightweight petals that hovered overhead (fig. 1). Crafted from steam-bent wood and rice paper, the petals contracted\nto define a small, intimate space within an otherwise open atrium by sensing human occupation, while interpreting sound\nlevels. As a prototype, it served its purpose well by engaging the academic audience (from architecture and related\ndisciplines) physically, but also engaging the audience’s imaginations. “Bloom” was critiqued by the studio and attending\nacademic audience not as a final product, but rather as a snapshot within a larger work-in-progress.\n\n288\n\nFigure 1 Bloom\nPrototype (Students:\nBrandon Hoopingarner,\nPaul Konwinski, Brianna\nNewton)\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nAn Inconvenient Studio\nFigure 2 Twist\nPrototype (Students:\nElizabeth Boone, Adam\nBuente, Kyle Perry)\n\n3.3 Twist\n\nFigure 3 Arcus Animus\nPrototype, the physical\nresult of a workshop\nled by Philip Beesley,\nUniversity of Waterloo\n\nA different project used custom-made drive belts to twist stretched-cloth panels in patterns (fig. 2). This project attached\nto a linear expanse of windows and sensed passers-by in an adjacent hallway, twisting and opening sequences of\npanels to reveal sunlight and views to the surrounding campus. The project consisted of a modular, expandable\nkit comprised of parts that were laser cut from acrylic. All connections were achieved without traditional hardware,\nunderscoring the importance of tolerances and details. This modular, “plug-in” design and assembly logic were key\nto testing and improving the installation’s performance. Sets of components formed modular assembly systems such\nas the framing systems, stretching systems, pivoting systems, twisting systems, etc. If one of these systems failed to\nperform, particular system components could be redesigned and fabricated quickly, while ready-made to plug back\ninto the larger whole. This partitioning of functions and systems made it possible to adapt particular component designs\nwith minimal interference or a redesign of the entire prototype.\n\n3.4 Arcus Animus\nThe next studio project, named “Arcus\nAnimus,” was a hanging installation composed\nof several layered mesh works, consisting\nof acrylic, bamboo, and mylar components\n(fig. 3). The installation reacted to human\noccupation, as interpreted by arrayed proximity\nsensors. These physical reactions consisted of\n“shaking” movements, actuated pneumatically\nusing solenoid valves and custom air muscles.\nThe workshop accelerated the students’\nlearning and application of many technical skills\nrelated to digital fabrication, electronics, and\nmicrocontroller programming. Beyond this, the\nstudents learned a great deal about teamwork\nand group dynamics, particularly as all of the\nwork occurred over a short, accelerated time\nline, necessitating the efficient delegation of\nmany overlapping tasks. Philip Beesley from\nthe University of Waterloo led the workshop\nand project, with most of the installation\ndesigned and planned in advance.\n\n3.5 Morpholuminescence\nFollowing the Arcus Animus workshop, a few small student teams developed entrepreneurial projects to apply their\nnew skills. One such project, titled Morpholuminescence, was developed as a submission to a student lightingdesign competition (fig. 4). The competition brief asked for lighting proposals for retail fitting rooms. The students\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n289\n\nAn Inconvenient Studio\ninterpreted the lighting scheme from a traditional three-point studio photography lighting setup to highlight the subject\nwhen modeling in front of a mirror. Proximity sensors track the posture of the human subject to control the hinged\ntriangular petals and variably tuned lighting. When the fitting room is unoccupied, the petals drop, revealing variable\nRGB LED lighting, highlighting the fitting room area with bright colors. When activated, the petals begin to close to\nform a faceted but continuous acrylic light surface, while the color and intensity of the fitting room lighting changes—\nbrighter for the task of changing clothes, and then optimized for highlighting the human subject in front of a mirror.\n\nacknowledgments\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the students from An Inconvenient Studio: Deepak Baniya, Elizabeth\nBoone, Eric Brockmeyer, Adam Buente, Luke Christen, Brandon Hoopingarner, Brad Horn, Paul Konwinski,\nYevge Monakhov, Brianna Newton, Kyle Perry, and Daisy Winkler.

Hemsath\n\nCollege of Architecture, University of Nebraska-Lincoln\n\nBrian McCracken\n\nCollege of Architecture, University of Nebraska-Lincoln\n\nDarin Russell\n\nCollege of Architecture, University of Nebraska-Lincoln\n\nAbstract\nThe deconstruction (DeCon) and repurposing (ReCon) of existing structures and materials are worthwhile and relevant\nendeavors given the potential for such procedures to be more economically and environmentally sustainable than\nconventional construction methods. Conventional construction methods often utilize virgin materials for the production\nof architecture, requiring extensive energy to harvest, process, and manufacture the materials for use. Today, we must\nface the fact that we exist in a carbon-sensitive economy, and demand design approaches that reduce architecture’s\nimpact on the environment. Our goal was to develop a CADCAM ReCon design methodology that would have the\npotential to mitigate carbon consumption. To explore this goal, students engaged a design research project that looked\nfor novel and innovative approaches to the DeCon and ReCon of an existing barn. The student researchers created\nparametric models and surface designs derived from the existing materials. The digitally fabricated tectonic design\nconstructions resulted in economical, novel, and material-efficient design methodologies for DeCon and ReCon.\n\n1 Introduction\nDeconstruction allows for the reuse of many building\nmaterials, with fundamental savings in the area of\n“embodied energy,” the total energy consumed in the\ncreation of the building and its components (Steward\nand Kuska 2003). The U.S. EPA estimates that American\ncompanies generate 136 million tons of building-related\nconstruction and demolition (C&D) waste per year, of\nwhich 92 percent is from renovation and demolition\nassemblies (Rodgers-Smith 2009). Researchers\nhave been exploring design for deconstruction as a\nstrategy for a zero waste industry. This laudable goal, if\nimplemented at a large scale, will have an immediate and\nlasting impact on design and construction. Currently, the\nDeCon material stream relies on upfront design strategies\nor downstream, end-of-life reuse and recycling to pull\nused materials back into use in new ways.\n\nFigure 1 Interior of Barn\n\nAs pointed out in the Design for Deconstruction Guide,\n“The real challenge for DfD [design for deconstruction]\nis to expand the range of materials and components\nbeyond a few specialty items that can be cherrypicked\nout of a building, to the components and materials that\nmake up the bulk of the building” (Shell, et al.). To begin\nour research on the DeCon material stream, we targeted the use of parametric software and digital fabrication strategies\nfor the ReCon of materials from a 1920s wood-frame barn, shown in figure 1.\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n291\n\nDecon Recon:\nParametric CADCAM Deconstruction Research\nDeconstruction research from the SmartScrap project sought to ReCon catalogued scrap limestone pieces that were\ndeployed in parametric design models (Kolarevic and Klinger 2008). Like many DeCon efforts, the amount of time required\nto catalogue the available sizes, shapes, and quantities of waste materials can be cost and time prohibitive, limiting their\nability to be reused. Therefore, the DeCon ReCon project sought a generic methodology with parametric modeling that\ncould accommodate the shifting dimensional variables inherent in the DeCon material stream.\n\nResearch Project\nTo begin the material inventory, students visited the site in order to complete a rough survey of the barn to be\ndeconstructed, in addition to the surrounding area. It was important to take into consideration the rough dimensions\nand quality of the repurposed material, some of which was moderately weathered, as it would inform the structural\nlimitations of the design. Students did not catalogue all the materials but, rather, used an approach that generalized the\namount of materials. The ambiguity of the survey was intentional to force a digital tectonic design approach that could\nmaximize the amount of ReCon materials.\nTo deal with the material variety between the pieces, the parametric model, developed in Rhinoceros and Grasshopper,\nfirst needed to have the flexibility to adapt to the several sizes of construction lumber that were reclaimed from the\noriginal 1920 wood-frame barn. A parametric box within Grasshopper that could be variable across the surface was\none method used to resolve the dimensional shift. By using three integer sliders and the interval box component, a\nparametric box was created. Each slider controls the x, y, and z parameters of the box, allowing for the variances of the\nlumber reclaimed from the existing barn.\nFigure 2 ReCon Design\nAlternatives by students\nNicholas Pajerski (above)\nand Brian McCracken\n(below)\n\nWith one method developed to accommodate the different sizes of lumber reclaimed from the barn, students focused\non how to generate building skins (fig. 2), which would be constructed from the reclaimed lumber. The skin or surface\nwas developed in Rhinoceros, using the cage edit command and implicit history, which quickly allowed various study\nmodels to be generated. Next, the surface was managed with Grasshopper to allow various paneling systems to be\napplied. Once a surface was finalized, a structural support system was developed, as shown in figure 3.\nAnother exercise currently under development explores the jointing and assembly methods of various DeCon materials;\nwe are building prototypes and detail mockups that utilize digital fabrication equipment: a CNC milling machine, laser\ncutter, and 3-D printer. A component of this activities includes wood joint research that will incorporate parametric of\ndetails (fig. 3) followed by the fabrication of various joints, using samples of existing materials gathered from the site.\n\n292\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nDecon Recon:\nParametric CADCAM Deconstruction Research\nConclusion\nThe methodology proposed in the design and implementation of CADCAM for the DeCon and ReCon of a 1920s\nwood-frame barn provides a framework for the ReCon of waste from the material stream. The parametric model\nenabled quick, formal input changes, based on a variety of material constraints. The digital tectonic enabled through\nCNC milling provided a flexible jointing strategy to construct the Recon pavilion (fig. 3).\n\nFigure 3 Model of\nReCon pavilion and\njoint study by student\nDarin Russell\n\nCritical to pedagogy is the acquisition of capabilities and skills directly related to the professional activity (Benedetto et\nal., 2001). Students learned by doing as they analyzed existing construction practices and designed DeCon methods\nand used CAM tools for ReCon activities. Ultimately, these small experiments will lead to further DeCon and ReCon\ndesign methods and ongoing carbon-neutral research that could be applied to the larger deconstruction industry.\n\nReferences\nBenedetto, C., Salvatore, C., Giuseppe, P.

When we work within the confines of our own disciplines, we forego the myriad ways other thinkers approach\nproblems. As designers, we are trained to maintain control of our work, to be the “master builders” and overseers of\neverything from overall concept to minute detail. So, we struggle with collaboration and, as a consequence, miss out on\nthe potential leaps forward that can result from having a diversity of voices at the design table. Oswall is a collaborative\nconstruction system that endeavors to leverage collaboration to make a game-changing leap forward.\nOswall (Open Source Wall) is an experimental wall prototype that challenges conventional residential wall construction\nthrough an open, collaborative approach to material, fabrication, and installation methods. It proposes an “open\nsource” construction platform in which third-party designers, engineers, scientists, or “do-it-yourselfers” can create,\nproduce, market, and sell “applications” that are plugged into the wall. These apps allow the end-user of the wall to\ncustomize his or her house according to lifestyle, number of occupants, season, or climate, and to draw continually on\ncurrent technological innovations. Specific wall applications under development include a solar collection application,\na rainwater collection application, an active ventilation application, a wind-energy harvesting application, and a passive\nheating application.\n\n1 Introduction\nThis paper will review two previously constructed wall prototypes, Drape Wall and Cloak Wall, and will illustrate how the\nthird prototype in the series, Oswall, will advance the research agenda set forth in those earlier projects. Oswall itself will\nleverage three primary developmental strategies—collaboration, crowd sourcing, and iteration—in order to interrogate\neffectively conventional residential construction. The paper will define these terms and identify how the authors plan to\nutilize them. Finally, the performance goals of the wall will be discussed in relation to larger issues of prototyping, as a\nrecognized form of academic research.\n\n2 History\nOswall is the third in a series of wall prototypes constructed over the past four years. While each wall was developed\nindependently, under its own set of criteria, together the walls form an evolutionary lineage of explorations that build off\none another. The first wall prototype was called “Drape Wall” and the second, “Cloak Wall.” Each has threads that inform\nthe current Oswall scheme and, so, are worth briefly reviewing here.\n\n2.1 Drape Wall\nDrape Wall, completed in 2006, explores energy conservation, modular component assembly, and pre-fabricated\nconstruction for an inexpensive house. It allows for quick assembly through stackable high-strength, low-weight exterior\nmodules, held in place by interlocking interior modules (fig. 1). A pattern of clear openings allows for light infiltration.\nThe modules can be configured to face the sun, reducing the need for electric lighting. Holes along the entire length\nof the wall system open to allow for natural ventilation, reducing cooling costs. A quilt-like fabric on the interior surface\nof the wall creates an interactive weather seal. Through the interplay between the hard outer shell and soft inner fabric,\n\n294\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nOswall (Open Source Wall): Rethinking Residential Wall\nConstruction through Collaboration, Crowd Sourcing, and Iteration\nthe homeowner can control the interior environment in response to outside conditions, such as temperature, humidity,\nweather, light levels, and desired views.\nFigure 1 Exterior view,\ninterior view, and detail\nview of Drape Wall\n\nWhile Drape Wall was successful in many ways, it also had numerous shortcomings. For example, it required a rigid\naluminum frame for support. As a result, it was never truly compact as a system and was difficult to erect on-site.\nAdditionally, some of the materials in the final prototype were simply stand-ins for what was originally intended.\n\n2.2 Cloak Wall\nCloak Wall (fig. 2), completed in 2007, represents three primary advancements over Drape Wall. First, as was mentioned\nabove, Drape Wall requires an aluminum frame for support. Cloak wall is self-supporting, clamped to its foundation by\nvertical tension cables. Second, the openings between blocks are of a fixed, uniform size in Drape Wall. The geometry\nof Cloak Wall’s blocks allows them to slide along one another horizontally, in order to adjust the opening size in response\nto desired orientation or view. Third, the surfaces of Drape Wall’s blocks are monochromatic and static. For Cloak Wall,\ncollaboration with a computer science researcher led to the development of a sophisticated paint application. Coated\nwith color-shifting paint, borrowed from the automotive industry, the wall surface is able to either reflect or absorb radiant\nheat depending on whether the sun is high in the sky (summer = reflection = light color) or low in the sky (winter =\nabsorption = dark color).\nFigure 2 Exterior view,\ninterior view, and detail\nview of Cloak Wall\n\nAs with Drape Wall, however, Cloak Wall still had several problems. First, the tensile structural system, as constructed,\nhas proven insufficient, upon testing, for the support of heavy roof loads. Practically, this means that the wall still needs\na rigid frame for support. Second, the theory of using color-shifting paint to either enhance or inhibit the transfer of heat\nis still just that: a theory. It has yet to be empirically tested, and a system has yet been developed to transfer heat from\nthe plenum space of the wall modules to the interior of the house.\n\n3 Oswall: collaboration, crowd sourcing, and iteration\nOswall is the third in this series of wall prototypes (fig. 3). It addresses the shortcomings of Drape Wall and Cloak Wall\nwhile carrying forward their strengths. Three methodological approaches define the wall’s development: collaboration,\ncrowd sourcing, and iteration.\nFigure 3 Image of Oswall\nstructural armature\nwithout “apps” in place\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\n3.1 collaboration\nFirst, as was the case with the previous two wall\nprojects, Oswall is being developed, fabricated,\nand subsequently tested through a collaborative\neffort involving electrical, mechanical, and\nbiomedical engineers; a product designer; an\nartist; an architect with significant research in\nmaterials; students; and a host of fabricators. It\npromises to be the most collaboratively driven of\nall three wall projects.\n\n295\n\nOswall (Open Source Wall): Rethinking Residential Wall\nConstruction through Collaboration, Crowd Sourcing, and Iteration\n3.2 Crowd Sourcing\nSecond, Oswall will evolve through “crowd sourcing.” This term refers to the use of many voices, usually via the web,\nto generate, share, and rank ideas. Oswall will evolve out of the enthusiasm of its collaborators and from a publicly\ndistributed call for app ideas. A website will define the project and an app, provide specifications, and then solicit\ninput. Peers with expertise in areas such as sensor and actuator technologies, advanced and sustainable materials,\nfabrication, and construction will develop app ideas in detail. The most compelling apps will be worked out technically\nand, ultimately, produced physically for a first-round prototype of the wall.\n\n3.3 Iteration\nFinally, Oswall will be built upon its precedents, as we learn from previous missteps, and will evolve further simply\nthrough the iterative process with which it is being developed. Through incremental advancements in some parts of the\nproject, we can hone, in Oswall, what already worked well. By starting over on other parts and asking the “crowd” what it\nthinks, we can make big leaps forward. In other words, iteration, rather than resulting in a baby-stepped permutation of a\nnearly identical variation of what came before, can actually free up parts of a project to advance further because creative\nenergy is focused on an unresolved portion of the design. In this case, Oswall’s infrastructure, which has benefited from\nthe several designs that preceeded it, is evolutionary. Its apps, on the other hand, will be entirely new and, thereby, can\nexhibit the kind of advancements necessary to address pressing disciplinary and global problems.\n\n4 Oswall Performance Brief\nAs mentioned earlier, Oswall reimagines conventional residential construction. It endeavors to be cost effective,\ncustomizable, self-regulating, and minimally demanding on the environment. To accomplish this, it utilizes a porous\nstructural framework that serves as an armature and a series of modular applications that clip into the wall and perform\na variety of tasks (fig. 4). These tasks range from heating and ventilation to lighting and communication. Together, these\ntwo parts (the armature and the apps) comprise a construction system that is highly adaptable to different users and\ndifferent climates, inexpensive to fabricate, easy to build with little equipment, and responsive in real time to user or\ncontextual changes.\n\nFigure 4 Diagram of\nOswall “apps” strategy\n\n296\n\nACADIA 09: reForm()\n\nOswall (Open Source Wall): Rethinking Residential Wall\nConstruction through Collaboration, Crowd Sourcing, and Iteration\nConclusion\n“Neuroscientists have shown that working with your hands exercises different parts of your cerebrum than sitting and\ncogitating. Ever wonder why Detroit isn’t producing 100-mpg cars? One reason might be that the engineers there\nspend all their time tinkering with CAD software—developing design concepts in a purely virtual sense. They aren’t\nripping open cars to see what’s possible, the way those amateur ultra-mileage Prius hackers do (some of whom, by\nthe way, have modded their hybrids to get 100 mpg).” “How DIYers Just Might Revive American Innovation,” Clive\nThompson, Wired Magazine, March, 2008.\nThe image of networked hackers modding high-tech cars in their garages is an accurate portrayal of the spirit with which\nwe are approaching the design, development, and construction of Oswall. We are prioritizing the unique knowledge\nof our collaborators, the wisdom of crowds, and the tacit information gained through iteration. Constantly evolving\nnetworking technologies and the unprecedented levels of communication they enable uniquely inform our process. As\nsuch, the development of Oswall presents pressing questions of architects today: Is our role as master designers the\nsame as it was 500, 50, or even 5 years ago? In a climate where architects have grown increasingly irrelevant, can we\nreinsert ourselves as expert networkers, strategists, and ethical decision makers? Can we relinquish control over our\nwork for the common good? Can we work in a truly collaborative capacity with others to solve the significant and real\nproblems we are all facing?\nOswall, above all else, is an open-ended question. As the third project in an evolutionary series of projects, it is more\n“market ready” than ever. However, we continue to view our research as the construction of full-scale sketches. This\nway, we are not intimidated by failure. As Bruce Mau states in his Incomplete Manifesto for Growth, “Make mistakes\nfaster.” This is when real progress is made and when true growth can occur. Oswall is a messy and difficult endeavor,\nbut through the efforts of a diverse team of collaborators, its outcome will be unpredictable and novel, and, most\nimportantly, will invigorate the debate over the relevance of academic research for architecture today.\n\nReferences\nBug Labs and Open Source Hardware Innovation by Ethan Zuckerman, www.worldchanging.com, January 21, 2009.\nwww.buglabs.net\nCrowdsourcing: Why the Power of the Crowd Is Driving the Future of Business, by Jeff Howe, Crown, 2008.\nHot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution—and How It Can Renew America, by Thomas L.
