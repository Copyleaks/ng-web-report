He brought with him his belief\nin ‘nature as a constructional model,’ to determine functionality in art and design.\n\nContext:\n\n\n'Albers & Moholy-Nagy: From the Bauhaus to the New World' at Tate Modern 9 March - 4 June 2006\nWorks by László Moholy-Nagy in the Tate Collection\nLászló Moholy-Nagy - Artist Writings\n\nIn 1937 the ecologist Julian Huxley hosted a sumptuous farewell dinner party for Walter Gropius upon his\ndeparture from London to become chair of the Harvard School of Design. The event took place at the then\nfashionable Trocadero, Oxford Street, with a guest list that reads as a Who's Who of the English scene of\nModernist design. Strangely, among the guests one also finds - besides Huxley - prominent ecological\nscientists and environmentalists, which raises the question of why they were invited.\nWhat brought the Bauhaus designers and ecologists together was a shared belief that the human household\nshould be modelled on the household of nature. Although some of them were inspired by biology while active\nin Germany, the fusion of biological reasoning with Bauhaus design took place during the process of trying to\nre-establish the school in London. After fleeing from Nazi harassment, Walter Gropius (who arrived in 1934\nand left in 1937), Marcel Breuer and László Moholy-Nagy (who both stayed between 1935 and 1937) were\nable to meet regularly again as a group.\nThe former Bauhaus faculty moved into a new apartment complex, the Lawn Road Flats in Hampstead, which\nwas the first Modernist residential building in London. Designed by Wells Coates, the building featured a\ncommon room (which Breuer redesigned into the Isobar Club in 1937). From his window Moholy-Nagy could\nenjoy overlooking a garden of \"only trees, which is very peaceful, especially in London\". The list of carefully\nselected tenants included intellectuals and designers enjoying what Gropius described as \"an exciting housing\nlaboratory, both socially and technically\". Technically, the building was to be a true machine for living with new\nfurniture (such as Breuer's Isokon Long Chair) and novelties such as built-in cooking and washing facilities.\nSocially, the apartment complex was to promote collective life and liberate the occupants from the burden of\npersonal possessions. Both Moholy-Nagy (1895-1946) and Gropius suffered from the language barrier (the\nlatter spoke only \"three words of English\"). Yet they were able to overcome the obstacle thanks to the\ncommunal spirit of the Flats. As the building's architect, Coates was in the midst of gatherings that soon\nevolved into the Modern Architecture Research Group, or MARS Group. This included notable designers such\nas Maxwell Fry (who collaborated with Gropius on several projects), Morton Shand and John Gloag.\nOne of the key debates was the role of biology in reshaping society. The MARS Group members became\nadvocates of environmental sensitivity: \"There must be no antagonism between architecture and its natural\nsetting,\" they pointed out in an exhibition manifesto of 1938.A drawing of a tree growing through a building was\nto illustrate that \"the architecture of the house embraces the garden. House and garden coalesce, a single unit\nin the landscape\". This appeal reflected values and ideas promoted by environmentalists such as Clough\nWilliams-Ellis, who thought Modernist design could save Britain from ecological destruction. Along with the\nprofessor of town planning at London University, Patrick Abercrombie, Williams-Ellis was on a crusade against\nunregulated development of the English landscape. Modern architecture, with its focus on light and fresh air,\nrepresented for them advancement in public health, as well as a remedy that could halt environmental\ndestruction of past developments.\nHG Wells was also a Bauhaus devotee. He was one of the most famous writers of popular science books,\nnovels and science fiction of his time, arguing that human life should be understood from an ecological point of\nview. Through his secretary, Moura Budberg, he came to know the Hungarian film producer Alexander Korda,\nwho expressed a desire to make a film based on Wells's ideas about architecture and ecological survival. The\nresult was Things to Come (1936), where Bauhaus designers save the world with the help of ecological\nengineering of nature, and for which Moholy-Nagy contributed several set designs.\n\nCover of the journal The Science of Life by H G Wells and Julian and G P Huxley, launched in 1929\n© Courtesy The British Library\n\nThe chief source of inspiration for Wells's interest in ecology was Julian Huxley. As secretary of the Zoological\nSociety, Huxley enjoyed a spacious residence at the London Zoo, which he had made into a showroom for\nModernist design. Here, scientists, architects and urban planners, as well as the environmentalist circle around\nWilliams-Ellis, met for discussions. Their basic idea was that old-fashioned housing design reinforced an\nunfortunate dualism between humans and nature, while the new Bauhaus design promised a reunion of\nhumans with nature through healthy living. The planning of cities that could secure the evolutionary survival of\nthe human species was the issue at stake.\nThe London art and writings of Moholy-Nagy were at the heart of these debates. Moholy-Nagy was Hungarian\nborn and the former professor of the metal workshop at the Weimar Bauhaus, where he also taught the\npreliminary design course. He and Gropius had previously compiled a series of books about Bauhaus design,\nin which his own Von Material zu Arkitektur (1929) appeared in the English language under the title The New\nVision in 1930. For many English speaking designers it became their first encounter with Bauhaus research\nmethods. He advised them to use \"nature as a constructional model\" and always look for \"prototypes in\nnature\"to determine functionality. Functionalism was a key word in the book. Late in life he would complain that\nthe original meaning of Louis Sullivan's motto \"form follows function\" had been \"blurred\" to a \"cheap\ncommercial slogan\", so that its original meaning was lost. According to Moholy-Nagy, it should be understood\nin view of \"phenomena occurring in nature\", where every form emerges from its proper function. This was also\nthe basic assumption in The New Vision: humans were governed by their biological nature and cultural\n\nartefacts would consequently only be functional if they conformed to human biology. \"Technical progress\nshould never be the goal, but instead the means\" for a healthy biological life, he argued.\nThe chief source of inspiration for this design programme was the Hungarian biologist Raoul H Francé (18741943). Though largely forgotten today, he was in the interwar period a best-selling biologist and director of the\nprestigious Biological Institute of the German Mycological Society in Munich. He was an outspoken defender of\npsychobiology - the theory that a certain vital psyche in living matter is a driving force in evolution. As one of\nthe founders of soil ecology, he believed that the earth had a dynamic power that gave plants a goal-orientated\nenergy aiming at evolutionary harmony among living organisms. Humans could benefit from the earth's vital\npowers. Francé argued that one merely had to learn from nature's workshop to find out what humans should\ndo in Die Pflanze als Erfinder (Plants as Inventors) of 1920, a book which Moholy-Nagy would frequently\nquote. Under the label \"bio-technique\", he founded the science of bionics to pursue this end. The aim was to\nstudy nature's workshop to generate principles, techniques and processes that could be applied to human\ntechnologies, so that society would live in harmony with nature. The structure of plants as well as their biotic\ncommunities should serve as models. It was possible to imagine a \"futuristic utopia\", he said, \"if the optimally\nfunctional form\" of plants and plant communities was applied to development of new technology, design,\narchitecture and urban planning.\nInspired by Francé, Moholy-Nagy's research was to find a way of designing that would set human life in\nharmony with nature's economy. In his artwork he investigated spacial relationships and functionality in relation\nto biological needs. He defined architecture as \"an organic component of living\" and argued that \"architecture\nwill be brought to its fullest realisation only when the deepest knowledge of human life in the biological whole is\navailable\". While living in London he drew up ambitious plans for a space-modulator (similar to his lightmodulator of 1930) in the form of a kaleidoscope that could produce every possible spacial relationship. The\naim was to research \"the biological bases of space experience\", so that the architect and designer could\nproportionally transfer the spatial order of nature into the human realm. The artwork Moholy-Nagy generated\nfrom this research, such as the LK III and the LIV paintings from 1936, could be understood as investigations\ninto human biological experience and function in different types of spaces.\n\nCover of R H Francé's Die Pflanze als Erfinder (Plants as Inventors) 1920\n\nBauhaus design came to reconcile the artificial and the natural in a way that would both enhance human life\npotentials and create a harmonious environment. Moholy-Nagy was pursuing an indirect argument for\necological protection, namely that a well-functioning biotic community was a precondition for a well-functioning\nhuman society. \"The new architecture on its highest plane will be called upon to remove the old conflict\nbetween organic and artificial, between open and closed, between country and city,\" he told British architects.\nHe was inspired by Francé's notion that every organic object had an harmonic organisation that manifested\nitself internally as a balanced structure and externally in the shape of ecological communities. Moholy-Nagy\ndeveloped his programme of social responsibility accordingly, by aiming to provide communities with\nstructurally sound design that gave support to human and non-human biological needs. \"The thesis on which\nthe Bauhaus was built,\" he argued by pointing to Gropius's first public lecture in London, \"is that art and\narchitecture which fail to serve for the betterment of our environment are socially destructive by aggravating\ninstead of healing the ills of an inequitable social system.\" Bauhaus design would determine \"the fate of our\ngeneration and the next\" if it successfully used the biological forces of life to improve social, economic,\ntechnical and hygienic matters, so that society could live in harmony with nature.\nIn his photographic art, Moholy-Nagy also sought to capture the vital life force of evolution outlined by Francé to \"replace the static principle of classical art with the dynamic principle of universal life\". In his abstract film\nprojects such as Light-play: black-white-gray (1932), he tried to portray the idea on the screen. This was also\nhis agenda in his commissioned photo illustrations for three picture books, Eton Portrait (1937), An Oxford\n\nUniversity Chest (1938) and The Street Markets of London (1936). By taking snapshots (as opposed to posed\nphotographs) of Eton and Oxford dons as well as market traders in action, Moholy-Nagy saw himself as a\nscientist \"providing a truthful record of objective determined fact\". These facts were also evidence of a classridden society where the biological forces of life failed to unfold. At Oxford, for example, he would juxtapose\nstudents and faculty members with images of the poor as if to remind the reader that the creative energy of\nacademic life all too often was a privilege of the rich.\nMoholy-Nagy made two documentary films in London that further illustrate his biologically-inspired design\nprogramme. The first was commissioned by a London documentary film company and released in 1935 as In\nthe Cradle of the Deep. It is a sixteen-minute-long naturalistic record of the growth of lobsters from baby to old\nage, as well as of the fisherman's struggle to search them out. He argued that a \"prehistoric animal shell is\nconstructed in such a wonderful way that we could immediately adapt it to a fine bakelite or other moulded\nplastic form\". The second was a fifteen-minute silent film commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art, New\nYork, The New Architecture of the London Zoo (1936). It is an attempt to show the spacial relationships within\na set of avant-garde buildings designed by Berthold Lubetkin, and fits well with Moholy-Nagy's project of\ndocumentation of different biological experiences of space in the human and animal world.\nIn 1937 Gropius and Moholy-Nagy left London for the United States, to Harvard University and the New\nBauhaus in Chicago respectively. At Harvard, Gropius would warn against industrialism and capitalistic greed\nthat could come to dominate human life unless architects approached design and the environment in a\nresponsible way: \"Overwhelmed by the miraculous potentialities of the machine, our human greed has\ninterfered with the biological cycle of human companionship which keeps the life of a community healthy.\" A\nsimilar line of thought was pursued by Moholy-Nagy at Chicago, where he envisaged \"happy and organic cities\nof which inhabitants have the experience of being amidst gardens and vegetation daily, not on their weekend\ntrips only\".
