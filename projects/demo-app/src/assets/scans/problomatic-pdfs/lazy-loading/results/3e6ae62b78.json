But research\nand experience have shown that prevention must begin with an\nunderstanding of these complex behavioral health problems within their\ncomplex environmental contexts; only then can communities establish\nand implement effective plans to address substance misuse.\nTo facilitate this understanding, SAMHSA developed the Strategic\nPrevention Framework (SPF). The five steps and two guiding principles\nof the SPF offer prevention planners a comprehensive approach to\nunderstanding and addressing the substance misuse and related\nbehavioral health problems facing their states and communities.\nThe SPF includes these five steps:\n1 . Assessment: Identify local prevention needs based on data (e .g ., What is the problem?)\n2 . Capacity: Build local resources and readiness to address prevention needs (e .g ., What do you\nhave to work with?)\n3 . Planning: Find out what works to address prevention needs and how to do it well (e .g ., What\nshould you do and how should you do it?)\n4 . Implementation: Deliver evidence-based programs and practices as intended (e .g ., How can\nyou put your plan into action?)\n5 . Evaluation: Examine the process and outcomes of programs and practices (e .g ., Is your plan\nsucceeding?)\nThe SPF is also guided by two cross-cutting principles that should be integrated into each of the steps\nthat comprise it:\n\n Cultural competence. The ability of an individual or organization to understand and\ninteract effectively with people who have different values, lifestyles, and traditions based on their\ndistinctive heritage and social relationships.\n\n Sustainability. The process of building an adaptive and effective system that achieves and\nmaintains desired long-term results.\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n4\n\nThe SPF has several defining characteristics that set it apart from other strategic planning processes.\nMost notably, it is:\n\n Dynamic and iterative. Assessment is the starting point, but planners will return to this\nstep again and again as their community’s substance misuse problems and capacities evolve.\nCommunities may also engage in activities related to multiple steps simultaneously. For example,\nplanners may need to find and mobilize additional capacity to support implementation once a\nprogram or practice is underway. For these reasons, the SPF is a circular rather than a linear\nmodel.\n\n Data-driven. The SPF is designed to help planners gather and use data to guide all prevention\ndecisions—from identifying which substance misuse problems to address in their communities,\nto choosing the most appropriate ways to address these problems, to determining whether\ncommunities are making progress.\n\n Reliant on and encourages a team approach. Each step of the SPF requires—and\ngreatly benefits from—the participation of diverse community partners. The individuals and\ninstitutions involved in prevention efforts may change as the initiative evolves, but the need for\nprevention partners will remain constant.\nThis toolkit provides an introduction to the SPF’s well-tested and user-friendly planning approach.\nOrganized by each of the steps in the framework, the toolkit provides a snapshot of how each of\nthe components fit together and build on one another. Used in tandem with its companion resource,\nSelecting Best-Fit Programs and Practices: Guidance for Substance Misuse Prevention Practitioners, the\ntoolkit provides an important starting point for engaging in a thoughtful, data-driven process that supports\nbest practices, engages critical stakeholders, and draws on evidence. Adherence to the principles in\nthe framework increases the likelihood that prevention efforts will produce anticipated outcomes, reduce\nharmful behaviors, and keep communities healthy and safe.\n\n5\n\nSTEP 1: ASSESSMENT\nOVERVIEW\nThe purpose of this step is to understand local prevention needs based on a careful review of data\ngathered from a variety of sources. These data help planners to identify and prioritize the substance\nmisuse problems present in their community; clarify the impact these problems have on community\nmembers; identify the specific factors that contribute to these problems; assess readiness; and\ndetermine the resources required to address those factors. Ultimately, a thorough and inclusive\nassessment process helps to ensure that substance misuse prevention efforts are appropriate and\non target.\nTo conduct a comprehensive assessment of prevention needs, prevention professionals gather data\nabout each of the following:\n\n The nature of the substance misuse problem in the community and related harmful behaviors\n Risk and protective factors that influence substance misuse problems, particularly those of high\npriority in the community\n\n Community capacity for prevention, including readiness and available resources\n\nStep 1:\nAssessment\n\nAssess\nproblems and\nrelated\nbehaviors\n\nPrioritize problems\n(criteria: magnitude,\ntime trend, severity,\ncomparison)\n\nAssess risk\nand\nprotective\nfactors\n\nStep 2:RELATED BEHAVIORS\nPROBLEMS AND\nCapacity\nRaise\nand misuse problems\nIt is important to assess the natureEngage\nand extent of bothDevelop\nsubstance\nand related harmful\ncommunity\n\nstrengthen a\n\ncommunity\n\nbehaviors in the community. But stakeholders\nwhat are problemsprevention\nand what\nare behaviors?\nawareness\nteam\n\nSubstance misuse problems are characterized by the behavior patterns that describe how substances\nare misused, for example, binge drinking alcohol. In turn, substance misuse problems may lead to other\nharmful behaviors or adverse outcomes, such as traffic accidents and fatalities from driving under the\nSelect between substance\ninfluence of alcohol\nHowever,\nand other\nDevelopmisuse\na\nStepor3:other drugs.\nPrioritize\nrisk the relationship\ninterventions\ncomprehensive\nPlanning\nand protective\nassociated problems\nis not one-to-one.\nAn individual’s\nsubstance misuse behavior can lead to a wide\n(criteria:\nplan that aligns\nfactors\n(criteria:\neffectiveness,\nrange of problems, often multiple ones—including illnesses,\ninjuries, violence\ntothe\nself and others, and\nwith\nimportance,\nconceptual\nfit,\nmodel\ncrimes. For example, binge drinking\namong 12- to 17-year-olds can lead tologic\nalcohol\npoisoning, motor\nchangeability)\npractical fit)\nvehicle crashes, delinquent and violent acts, and other serious problems reported in this age group.\n\nASSESSING PROBLEMS AND RELATED HARMFUL BEHAVIORS\n\nPrevention planners\nStepcan\n4: use the following questions to guide community assessment of substance\nBalance fidelity\nDeliver\nEstablish\nImplementation\nRetain core\nmisuse problems\nand related harmful\nbehaviors: with planned\nprograms and\npractices\n\nadaptations\n\ncomponents\n\nimplementation\nsupports and\nmonitor\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n6\n\n What substance misuse problems (e.g., overdoses, alcohol poisoning) and related harmful\n\nbehaviors (e.g., prescription drug misuse, underage drinking) are occurring in the community?\n\n How often are these substance misuse problems and related harmful behaviors occurring?\nWhich ones are happening the most?\n\n Where are these substance misuse problems and related harmful behaviors occurring\n(e.g., at home or in vacant lots, in small groups or during big parties)?\n\n Who is experiencing more of these substance misuse problems and related harmful behaviors\n(e.g., males, females, youth, adults, members of certain cultural groups)?\n\nThe answers to these questions can help planners identify—and determine how to most effectively\naddress—a community’s priority substance misuse problem(s). To obtain these answers, planners\nrely on data. Data is the driving force behind the SPF planning process. Prevention efforts are more\nsuccessful when planners use data to understand the substance misuse problems facing their\ncommunities.\nCommunity practitioners and planners may begin by collecting existing state and local archival data that\nare readily available. In some instances, states, tribes, and jurisdictions have established epidemiological\nworkgroups—collaborative groups of agencies and individuals focused on using data to inform and\nenhance prevention practice at both the state and local levels. These workgroups collect, analyze,\nand disseminate a wide variety of substance use and behavioral health data. These findings are\noften presented in epidemiological profiles—detailed reports that summarize the problems affecting a\nparticular community or population. Hospitals, law enforcement agencies, community organizations, and\nstate agencies can also be important sources of data.\nOnce the data are compiled, it is important to examine and discard what is irrelevant or not useful.\nIt is also important to determine whether any information (e.g., about a particular problem, behavior,\nor population group) is missing and, if so, identify ways to fill data gaps by collecting new data. (See\nAppendix A to learn about data collection methods and their benefits and limitations.)\n\nPRIORITIZING PROBLEMS AND RELATED HARMFUL BEHAVIORS\nData collected through the assessment process may reveal that a community has multiple areas of\nneed that are contributing to substance misuse. Planners will want to establish criteria for analyzing\nassessment data in order to determine how to prioritize problem(s). These criteria may include the\nfollowing:\n\n Magnitude: Describes the prevalence of a specific substance misuse problem or harmful\nbehavior (e.g., Which problem/behavior is most widespread in your community?)\n\n Severity: Describes how large an impact a specific substance misuse problem or harmful\nbehavior has on the people or the community (e.g., Which problem/harmful behavior is\nmost serious?)\n\n Trend: Describes how substance misuse patterns are changing over time within a community\n(e.g., Which problem/harmful behavior is getting worse or better?)\n\n7\n\n Changeability: Describes how likely it is that a community will be able to modify the problem\nor behavior (e.g., Which problem/harmful behavior are you most likely to influence with your\nprevention efforts?)\n\nWhen setting priorities, planners should consider all four of these criteria together in order to gain a\nbalanced view of the problem, its significance in the community, and the potential for change. Different\nplanners or practitioners may weigh each criterion differently, depending on their unique community\ncontext and perspective. Working through these considerations is important to build support for the\ncommunity prevention efforts that will be directed to the priority substance misuse problem.\n\nASSESSING RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS\nOnce a community has identified one or more priority problems, it is important to look at the factors\nassociated with those problems. Two types of factors influence the likelihood that an individual will\ndevelop a substance misuse or related mental health problem:\n\n Risk factors are associated with a higher likelihood of developing a problem (e.g., low impulse\ncontrol, peer substance use).\n\n Protective factors are associated with a lower likelihood of developing a problem (e.g., academic\nachievement, parental bonding, and family cohesion).\n\nUnderstanding risk and protective factors is essential to prevention.\n\nProblems\nand related\nbehaviors\n\nRisk and\nprotective\nfactors\n\nPrograms\nand\npractices\n\nPrevention planners cannot change a substance misuse problem directly. Instead, they need to work\nthrough the underlying risk and protective factors that influence the problem. A prevention program or\npractice can only make a difference if it’s a good match for both the problem and its underlying factors.\nThe following are some key features of risk and protective factors:\n\n Risk and protective factors exist in multiple contexts (e.g., individual, family, peer, and community).\n Risk and protective factors are correlated and cumulative.\n Individual factors can be associated with multiple problems.\n Risk and protective factors are influential over time.\nIt is important to recognize that the underlying factors driving a substance misuse problem in one\ncommunity may differ from the factors driving that same problem in a different community. Effective\nprevention focuses on reducing the risk factors and strengthening the protective factors specific to the\npriority problem in your community. (See Appendix B to learn more about risk and protective factors.)\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n8\n\nASSESSING CAPACITY FOR PREVENTION\nAssessing a community’s available resources and readiness to address substance misuse is a key part\nof the prevention planning process. Prevention efforts are more likely to succeed when they are informed\nby a complete assessment of a community’s capacity to address the identified substance misuse\nproblems. Capacity for prevention includes two main components: resources and readiness.\nResources include anything a community can use to establish and maintain a prevention effort that\ncan respond effectively to local problems. Examples include:\n\n People (e.g., staff, volunteers)\n Specialized knowledge and skills (e.g., research expertise)\n Community connections (e.g., access to population groups)\n Concrete supplies (e.g., money, equipment, technology)\n Community awareness about local substance misuse problems (e.g., high rates of opioid\noverdose)\n Existing efforts to address those problems (e.g., policies)\nA well-planned and focused resource assessment will produce far more valuable information than one\nthat casts a wide net. To that end, it’s helpful to focus capacity assessments on resources that are\nrelated to your priority problem(s). At the same time, keep in mind that useful and accessible resources\nmay also exist beyond the boundaries of the community’s substance misuse prevention effort. Many\norganizations, including state and government agencies, law enforcement, health care centers, and\nfaith-based organizations are also working to reduce the impact of substance misuse and other harmful\nbehavioral health problems.\nReadiness describes the motivation and willingness of a community to commit local resources to\naddressing identified substance misuse problems. Factors that affect readiness include:\n\n Knowledge of the substance misuse problem\n Existing efforts to address the problem\n Availability of local resources\n Support of local leaders\n Community attitudes toward the problem\nReadiness assessments should reflect the preparedness of the community sectors that will be involved\nin addressing the priority problem and/or will be affected by it. To do this, prevention planners must\nengage in a culturally competent assessment process that includes representatives from across\ncommunity sectors. A thorough capacity assessment should include information about:\n\n The cultural and ethnic makeup of the community\n How problems are perceived among different sectors of the community\n Who has been engaged in previous prevention efforts\n Existing barriers to participation in prevention efforts\n\n9\n\nTo assess readiness for prevention, it is often helpful to speak, one-on-one, with local decision-makers\nand public opinion leaders. If individuals with access to critical prevention resources are not initially\nsupportive of or invested in prevention efforts, then it will be important to find ways early on to increase\ntheir level of readiness.\nUnderstanding local capacity, including both resources and readiness, helps prevention planners to:\n\n Make realistic decisions about which substance misuse problem(s) a community is prepared to\naddress.\n\n Identify resources a community may need, but doesn’t currently have, for addressing identified\nprevention needs.\n Develop a clear plan for building and mobilizing capacity (see SPF Step 2) to address identified\nproblems.\nAssessing community readiness, in particular, helps prevention professionals determine whether there\nis social momentum for addressing the issue(s) they hope to tackle. Community readiness is just as\nimportant in addressing substance misuse problems as having tangible resources in place.\n\nSHARING ASSESSMENT FINDINGS\nThe final step in completing a needs and capacity assessment is to communicate key findings to\nprevention stakeholders. There are many ways to share findings, but what is critical is that the chosen\napproach is the right match for the audience. Included below are some key considerations for sharing\nassessment findings.\n\n Develop a full report. Funders and close prevention partners (e.g., task force members) will want\nthe whole story. It’s helpful to have all of the details in one place.\n\n Highlight key findings. For stakeholders who may be interested only in assessment highlights,\ndevelop brief handouts or short slide presentations.\n\n One size does not fit all. Be prepared to tailor assessment materials by featuring those data that\n\nare most meaningful to each audience. This is particularly important when presenting assessment\nfindings to key stakeholders (e.g., local decision-makers, public opinion leaders, and potential\npartners). If these individuals have specific questions or reservations, be sure to address them.\n\n Solicit input from the community. Find ways for community members and groups to provide\n\nfeedback on the assessment results. Their comments can help to confirm that prevention plans\nare on track and/or shed light on findings that may have been confusing or surprising.\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n10\n\nSTEP 2: CAPACITY\nOVERVIEW\nIn this step, local resources are built and mobilized and the community’s readiness to address priority\nsubstance misuse problems is determined. In Step 1, planners took stock of what was available in their\ncommunities. In Step 2, they ensure the readiness of the community to buy in to the prevention effort and\ntake stock of the resources needed to tackle the problem and produce a positive change.\nA community needs both human and structural resources to establish and maintain a prevention system\nthat can respond effectively to local problems. It also needs people who have the motivation and\nwillingness—that is, the readiness—to commit local resources to addressing these problems.\nThe following are three strategies for building local capacity for prevention:\n1. Engage diverse community stakeholders\n2. Develop and strengthen a prevention team\nStep 1:\n3.

It is also important to recognize that potential community partners will have varying\nlevels of interest and/or availability to get involved. One person may be willing to help out with a specific\ntask, while another may be willing to assume a leadership role. Keep in mind that as people come\nto understand the importance of prevention efforts, they are likely to become more engaged. (See\nAppendix C to learn more about levels of involvement.)\nThe following list includes some of the ways to approach people and organizations in the community with\ninformation about, and invitations to participate in, prevention efforts:\n\n Call known contacts, particularly those with overlapping interests\n Attend and speak up at community meetings and events\n Ask partners to contact their partners\n Keep potential partners well informed about prevention activities and progress made\n Meet with key players, including public opinion leaders and local decision-makers\n Anticipate and overcome roadblocks (e.g., address the concerns of those who might oppose or\nhinder prevention efforts)\nIncluded below are different ways to encourage stakeholders who are already engaged to get more\ninvolved in prevention efforts:\n\n Meet face-to-face to discuss overlapping goals and agendas\n Extend an invitation to attend a prevention team or task force meeting\n Once prevention planning is underway, make more specific requests for involvement\n Extend invitations to attend future prevention events and activities\n Maintain relationships by keeping stakeholders informed of prevention activities and progress\nmade\n\nDEVELOPING AND STRENGTHENING A PREVENTION TEAM\nA strong prevention team is often the guiding force behind effective prevention efforts. The prevention\nteam, or task force, should include representatives from those community sectors that are most vital\nto the success of the prevention initiative. In other words, the prevention team will be a subset of\nthe stakeholders identified above. Here are some considerations for building and/or strengthening a\nprevention team:\n\n Be deliberate. Establishing a representative prevention team requires deliberate and strategic\n\nplanning. When inviting new members, be clear about the purpose of the collaboration, determine\nhow goals will be attained, and establish clear roles and responsibilities for all involved.\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n12\n\n Build prevention knowledge. A truly representative prevention team means that members will\n\nbring diverse insights and experiences to the table, as well as varied knowledge and perspectives\non the priority problem being addressed. Use a variety of strategies—including guest speakers\nand group trainings—to increase the team’s understanding of the problem and effective prevention\nstrategies.\n\n Monitor and improve group structure and processes, as needed. Even the most well-\n\ninformed group won’t be productive unless it functions well. To help the team work together\neffectively, discuss how you will share leadership, make decisions, divide tasks, resolve conflicts,\nand communicate with one another as well as with the broader community.\n\nRAISING COMMUNITY AWARENESS\nBy raising public awareness about a community’s priority substance misuse problem(s), prevention\nplanners can help garner valuable resources and increase local readiness for prevention. The following\nare some strategies for raising community awareness:\n\n Meet one-on-one with public opinion leaders\n Ask task force members to share information in their own sectors\n Submit articles to local newspapers, church bulletins, neighborhood newsletters, etc.\n Share information on relevant websites and social media outlets\n Host community events to share information about and discuss the problem\n Convene focus groups to get input on prevention plans\nIt is always helpful to think “outside the box” when looking for new ways to raise community awareness.\nFor example, the local high school may have a media club that can help to create a video about the\ncommunity’s priority problem and/or prevention efforts. Also, think about “ripple” potential—that is,\nwhich individuals and community groups might help to spread the word and get others involved in\nprevention efforts.\nFinally, when building capacity, don’t forget about the data. Data collected during the assessment\nprocess can help to increase general awareness about critical prevention problems and engage key\nstakeholders. Data can also be used to mobilize resources to support prevention efforts.\n\n13\n\nSTEP 3: PLANNING\nOVERVIEW\nStrategic planning increases the effectiveness of prevention efforts by ensuring that prevention planners\nselect and implement\nthe1:most appropriate programs and strategies for their communities.

These are changed\nindirectly by addressing the risk and protective factors that are associated with the problem. Evidencebased programs and practices can only make a difference if they’re a good match for both the substance\nmisuse problem and the underlying risk and/or protective factors that drive changes in that problem.\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n14\n\nPRIORITIZING RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS\nEvery substance misuse problem in every community is associated with multiple risk and protective\nfactors. No community can address all of these factors—at least not all at once. So, the first step in\ndeveloping a prevention plan is to figure out which risk and protective factors are the “key drivers” of a\ncommunity’s priority problems. To prioritize factors, it is helpful to consider a factor’s importance and\nchangeability.\nImportance describes how a specific risk or protective factor affects a problem. To determine a\nfactor’s importance, ask the following:\n\n How much does this factor contribute to our priority problem?\n Is this factor relevant, given the developmental stage of our focus population?\n Is this factor associated with other harmful behavioral health problems?\nChangeability describes a community’s capacity to influence a specific risk or protective factor. To\ndetermine a factor’s changeability, ask the following:\n\n Do we have the resources and readiness to address this factor?\n Does a suitable program or practice exist to address this factor?\n Can we produce outcomes within a reasonable timeframe?\nWhen developing a prevention plan, it is best to prioritize risk and protective factors that are high for both\nimportance and changeability.\n\nIMPORTANCE\n\nHigh importance and\nlow changeability\n\nHigh importance and\nhigh changeability\n\nRisk and\nprotective\nfactors\nLow importance and\nlow changeability\n\nLow importance and\nhigh changeability\n\nCHANGEABILITY\n\nIf no factors are high for both, the next best option is to prioritize factors with high importance and\nlow changeability. Since factors with high importance contribute significantly to priority substance\nmisuse problems, addressing these factors is more likely to make a difference. Also, it may be easier\nto increase the changeability of a factor (e.g., by building capacity) than it is to increase its importance.\nIn some cases, however, a community may choose to address a factor with low importance and high\nchangeability. Doing this can give the community a quick “win,” help raise awareness and support for\nprevention, as well as increase the community’s capacity to address more important factors in the future.\n\n15\n\nSELECTING APPROPRIATE PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES\nSometimes people want to select prevention programs or practices that are popular, those that worked\nwell in a different community, or those with which they are familiar. These are not necessarily the best\nselection criteria. What is more important is that the program or practice can effectively address the\npriority substance misuse problem and associated risk and protective factors, and that it is a good fit for\nthe specific community.\nThe following are three important criteria for selecting appropriate prevention programs and practices:\n\n Evidence-based foundation. Whenever possible, prevention planners should select programs\nor practices that are evidence-based (i.e., that have documented evidence of effectiveness). The best\nplaces to find evidence-based programs are federal registries, peer-reviewed journals, systematic\nreviews, and individual evaluation reports. Planners may also look to federal reports, such as Facing\nAddiction in America: The Surgeon General’s Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health, 2016; many\ninclude extensive program listings and descriptions. Since states have different guidelines for what\nconstitutes credible evidence of effectiveness, it can also be helpful to talk to prevention experts,\nincluding state-level evidence-based workgroups.\n\n Conceptual fit. A program or practice has a good conceptual fit if it directly addresses one or more\nof the priority factors driving a specific substance misuse problem and has been shown to produce\npositive outcomes for members of the focus population. To determine a conceptual fit, ask, “Will this\nprogram or practice have an impact on at least one of the community’s priority risk and protective\nfactors?”\n\n Practical fit. A program or practice has a good practical fit if it is culturally relevant for the focus\npopulation, the community has the will and capacity to support it, and it enhances or reinforces\nexisting prevention activities. To determine a practical fit, ask, “Is this program or practice appropriate\nfor our community?”\nEvidence-based programs or practices with both conceptual fit and practical fit will have the highest\nlikelihood of producing positive prevention outcomes. (To learn more about each of these criteria, see\nSAMHSA’s companion tool Selecting Best-Fit Programs and Practices: Guidance for Substance Misuse\nPrevention Practitioners.)\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n16\n\nENSURING A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH\nIn a comprehensive approach to prevention, programs and practices combine to reach people with\ndifferent levels of risk. They target multiple social contexts and ensure cultural relevance. Each of these\nis described below.\n\n Levels of risk. To stop the progression of\nsubstance misuse, effective prevention efforts include\nthose programs and practices that are directed toward\nindividuals or groups who are not yet engaging in\nrisky behaviors (e.g., alcohol awareness programs\nfor all 10th grade students). These efforts also\ninclude interventions for individuals or groups who\nhave a higher likelihood of engaging in these risky\nbehaviors or who have already begun doing so (e.g.,\nprograms for children whose parents have substance\nuse disorders, or post-overdose interventions for\nindividuals who have survived an opioid overdose).\n\nSOCIETY\nCOMMUNITY\nRELATIONSHIP\nINDIVIDUAL\n\n Multiple social contexts. The socio-ecological model shows how risk and protective factors\noperate across all social contexts, including individuals, friends and family, schools and other\ncommunity settings as well as the broader societal context of laws and norms. A comprehensive\nprevention plan includes multiple programs and practices, operating in multiple settings and across\nmultiple domains. (See Appendix D: The Socio-Ecological Model to learn more about this topic.)\n\n Cultural relevance. Programs and practices must be responsive to, and appropriate for, the\ndifferent cultural groups that comprise a focus population. Throughout the SPF process, planners\nmust take steps to ensure the cultural relevance of prevention efforts. For example:\n\n During Step 1: Assessment. Map the cultural landscape to identify different population\n\ngroups in the community as well as key leaders within each group. Analyze assessment data\nby group.\n\n During Step 2: Capacity. Share and discuss assessment findings throughout the community.\nInvite interested community members and groups to participate in prevention planning. Make\nsure the planning team includes individuals with strong ties to groups at high risk.\n\n During Step 3: Planning. Recruit focus population members to help identify appropriate\n\nprograms and practices. Convene focus groups with diverse community members to obtain\nvaluable feedback on potential interventions.\n\nBUILDING AND SHARING A LOGIC MODEL\nA logic model is a graphic planning tool, much like a roadmap, that can help prevention planners\ncommunicate where prevention efforts are headed and how goals will be reached. Logic models can\nhelp planners:\n\n Explain why a program or practice will succeed. By clearly laying out the tasks of\n\ndevelopment, implementation, and evaluation, a logic model can help planners clearly explain\nwhat will happen and why.\n\n17\n\n Identify the logical connections between the problem to be addressed, the associated\n\nunderlying factors, and the prevention programs and practices that will effect change.\nLogic models help to expose gaps in reasoning or “disconnects” between the community’s\nproblem and the actions that have been planned to address it. A logic model helps planners\nidentify places where assumptions might be off track or may be unsupported by research or past\nexperience. The sooner mistakes are discovered, the easier they are to correct.\n\n Make evaluation and reporting easier. Developing a logic model before implementing a\n\nprogram or practice makes evaluation easier since it shows clear, explicit, and measurable\nintended outcomes. When a prevention initiative is laid out fully and clearly in a logic model,\nit is much easier to identify appropriate evaluation questions and gather the data needed to\nanswer them.\n\nThough logic models can vary in their design, most include the following four critical components.\n\nProblems\nand related\nbehaviors\n\nRisk and\nprotective\nfactors\n\nPrograms\nand\npractices\n\nOutcomes\n\nOutcomes are the changes communities want their prevention programs and practices to produce.\nPrevention outcomes can be either short-term or long-term.\n\n Short-term outcomes. Short-term outcomes are the most immediate effects of a program\nor practice. Short-term outcomes are closely related to how well a program or practice is\nimplemented. These include changes in knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and skills, and are usually\nconnected to changes in priority risk and protective factors.\n\n Long-term outcomes. Long-term outcomes are the effects of a program or practice after\nit has been in place for an extended, clearly defined, period of time—usually months or years.\nShort-term outcomes reflect changes primarily in risk/protective factors. Long-term outcomes\nbuild on these short-term effects to produce changes in substance misuse behavior.\nAfter completing a logic model for prevention, it is important to share it with these two important groups:\n\n Prevention partners. These include the individuals, groups, and institutions who participated\nin the needs assessment; were brought onboard during the capacity-building process; and will\nplay a key role in selecting prevention programs and strategies. Make sure the logic model clearly\ncommunicates what the prevention plan hopes to accomplish and what the role of partners will be\nin helping everyone to get there.\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n18\n\n Other prevention stakeholders. These include funders as well as community members\nand groups who may not yet be actively involved in prevention efforts. A logic model can help\nplanners build support for prevention overall, as well as to mobilize the specific capacities needed\nto implement specific programs and practices. Also, the more people who understand the problem\nand are onboard with the prevention plan, the more likely it is that selected programs and practices\nwill be sustained over time.\n\n19\n\nCapacity\n\nEngage\ncommunity\nstakeholders\n\nDevelop and\nstrengthen a\nprevention team\n\nRaise\ncommunity\nawareness\n\nSTEP 4: IMPLEMENTATION\nSelect\nDevelop a\nPrioritize risk\ninterventions\ncomprehensive\nand protective\nIn this step, a community’s prevention\nplan is put (criteria:\ninto action by delivering\nevidence-based\nprograms and\nplan that\naligns\nfactors (criteria:\neffectiveness,\nwith\nthe\nimportance,this task,conceptual\npractices as intended.

The greater the fidelity to the original program design, the more likely the program\nwill be to reproduce positive results. While customizing a program to better reflect the attitudes, beliefs,\nexperiences, and values of a focus population can increase its cultural relevance, it is important to keep\nin mind that such adaptations may compromise program effectiveness.\nRemaining faithful to the original design of an evidence-based program or practice, while addressing\nthe unique needs and characteristics of the target audience, requires balancing fidelity and adaptation.\nWhen we change a program, we risk compromising outcomes. However, implementing a program that\nrequires some adaptation may be more efficient and cost-effective than designing a program from\nscratch.\nConsider these guidelines when balancing fidelity and adaptation:\n\n Retain core components. Evidence-based programs are more likely to be effective when their\n\ncore components are maintained. Core components are those parts of a program or practice that\nare responsible for producing positive outcomes, and thus most essential and indispensable. Core\ncomponents are like the key ingredients in a cookie recipe. We might be able to take out the\nchocolate chips, but if we take out the flour—a core component—the recipe won’t work. However,\nunderstanding and adhering to the principles underlying each core component may allow for\nflexibility (see Adapt with care on next page).\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n20\n\n Build capacity before changing the program. Rather than change a program to fit local\nconditions, consider ways to develop resources or to build local readiness so that it can be\ndelivered as it was originally designed.\n\n Add rather than subtract. Doing so decreases the likelihood of important program elements (i.e.,\nthose that are critical to program effectiveness) getting lost.\n\n Adapt with care. Even when programs and practices are selected with great care, there may\n\nbe ways to improve their appropriateness for a unique focus population. Cultural adaptation,\nfor example, refers to modifications that are tailored to the beliefs and practices of a particular\ngroup and enhance the cultural relevance of an intervention. To make a program or practice more\nculturally appropriate, consider the language, values, attitudes, beliefs, and experiences of focus\npopulation members.\n\n If adapting, get help. Knowledge experts, such as program developers, can provide information\non how a program has been adapted in the past, how well these adaptations have worked, and\nwhat core components should be retained to maintain effectiveness. Members of the focus\npopulation can also suggest ways to enhance program materials or messaging to better reflect\ntheir concerns and experiences.\n\nKeep in mind that adaptations can be planned in order to improve a program (e.g., the case with cultural\nadaptation) or unplanned. It’s important to be aware of the potential for unplanned changes that may\noccur during implementation (e.g., missed sessions when schools close unexpectedly due to bad\nweather) and to address any changes that might compromise program effectiveness (e.g., schedule\nmakeup sessions so students don’t miss out on core program content).\n\nESTABLISH IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORTS\nMany factors combine to influence implementation and support the success of prevention efforts. These\ninclude the following:\n\n Favorable prevention history. An individual (or organization) who has had positive experiences\n\nimplementing prevention programs or practices in the past is likely to be more willing and able\nto support the implementation of a new intervention. If an individual (or organization) has had a\nnegative experience implementing a program or practice—or doesn’t fully understand its potential\n—make sure to address their concerns early in the implementation process.\n\n Leadership and administrative support. Prevention programs and practices assume many\n\nforms and are implemented in many different settings. However, in order to be effective, all of them\nrequire leadership and support from key stakeholders.\n\n Provider selection. When selecting the best candidate to deliver a prevention program, consider\n\nprofessional qualifications and experiences, practical skills, as well as fit with the focus population.\nAsk, “Who is prepared to implement the program effectively? With whom will program participants\nfeel comfortable?” Certain provider characteristics that extend beyond academic qualifications\nand experience factors are difficult to teach in training sessions, so must become part of the\nselection criteria.\n\n21\n\n Provider training and support. Pre- and in-service trainings can help providers who are\n\nresponsible for implementing a program to understand how and why it works, practice new skills,\nand receive constructive feedback. Since most skills are learned on the job, it is also very helpful\nto connect these providers with a coach who can provide ongoing support. The implementation of\nevidence-based programs and practices requires behavior change at the provider, supervisory,\nand administrative support levels. Training and coaching are the principal ways in which behavior\nchange is brought about for selected staff in the beginning stages and throughout the process of\nimplementing evidence-based programs and practices.\n\n A clear action plan. When developed in collaboration with all key partners, these plans can\n\nhelp to ensure that everyone involved in implementation is on the same page and no key tasks\nfall through the cracks. A clear action plan includes all implementation tasks, deadlines, and\nperson(s) responsible.\n\n Implementation monitoring. By closely monitoring and evaluating the delivery of a program\n\nor practice, planners can make sure that it is being implemented as intended and can thereby\nimprove it as needed. By assessing program outcomes, planners can determine whether a\nprogram or practice is working as intended and is worthy of sustaining over time. Assessments\nof provider performance and measures of fidelity also provide useful feedback to managers and\nimplementers regarding the progress of implementation efforts and the usefulness of training and\ncoaching. (See Step 5: Evaluation to learn more about this topic.)\n\nThese implementation supports are interactive and can compensate for one another, so that a weakness\nin one can be overcome by strengths in others. Organizations are dynamic and there is an ebb and flow\nto the relative contribution of each support to the overall outcomes. Implementation monitoring can help\nto reveal where supports may need to be adjusted to improve effectiveness or efficiency.\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n22\n\nStep 2:\nCapacity\n\nSTEP 5: EVALUATION\nEngage\ncommunity\nstakeholders\n\nDevelop and\nstrengthen a\nprevention team\n\nRaise\ncommunity\nawareness\n\nOVERVIEW\nIn the SPF, evaluation is about enhancing prevention practice.

This means asking questions at three levels:\n1. Since a comprehensive prevention plan includes multiple programs and practices, examine\nseparately how each was delivered and the degree to which it produced positive outcomes.\n2. Determine how well these different programs and practices work together as part of the\ncommunity’s comprehensive plan to address priority substance misuse problems.\n3. Evaluate the implementation of the SPF process itself (e.g., “Were all step-specific tasks\ncompleted? Were cultural competence and sustainability principles and activities integrated along\nthe way?”)\nStakeholder involvement is as crucial a part of the evaluation step as it is of other SPF steps. An\nevaluation stakeholder is anyone who cares about, or has something to gain or lose from, a program\nor practice and its evaluation findings. This includes members of those populations that the prevention\nprogram or practice is intended to reach. The importance and benefits of involving diverse stakeholders\n\n23\n\nin the evaluation process cannot be overstated. By involving diverse stakeholders, prevention\nplanners can:\n\n Demonstrate respect for the many individuals and groups connected to prevention efforts.\n Obtain the help and support needed to conduct a thorough evaluation.\n Enhance understanding of the evaluation process among those involved in data collection and\n\n\n\n\n\nanalysis.\nEnsure the cultural relevance and appropriateness of the evaluation design, tools, and findings.\nIncrease the credibility of prevention programming as well as the evaluation process and findings.\nIncrease the likelihood that evaluation findings will be disseminated and used.\nGarner support for any efforts to expand and/or sustain programs and practices that have been\nshown to be effective.\n\nUNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROCESS AND\nOUTCOME EVALUATION\nIn the SPF, prevention planners consider two types of evaluation: process and outcome.\nProcess evaluation answers the question, “Did we do what we said we would do?” Prevention\nplanners use process evaluation extensively to assess the quality of implementation, keep\nimplementation on track, and inform adjustments that can strengthen the effectiveness of their prevention\nefforts. Process data help prevention planners determine the following:\n\n Were programs and practices implemented as planned?\n What adaptations were made?\n Were the resources sufficient?\n What obstacles were encountered?\n Who participated and for how long?\nOutcome evaluation measures the direct effects of a program or practice following implementation,\nThat is, it determines whether the program or practice made a difference and, if so, what changed. An\noutcome evaluation might document changes in a population group’s knowledge, attitudes, skills, or\nbehavior in both the short- and long-term. Specifically, outcome data can help planners determine:\n\n What changes occurred.\n How resulting changes compare to what the program or practice was expected to achieve.\n How resulting changes compare with those of individuals not exposed to the program or practice.\nBoth process and outcome data are important. Outcome evaluation looks at results, but results don’t\ntell the whole story. An evaluation that focuses only on outcomes is sometimes called a “black box”\nevaluation because it does not take process into consideration. Case in point, examining how a program\nor practice was implemented, the number of clients served, dropout rates, and how clients experienced\nthe intervention can shed light on disappointing outcome evaluation results. Similarly, examining these\nsame factors can also explain positive evaluation results. (One can’t take credit for positive results if one\ncan’t show what caused them.) An outcome evaluation alone, without a process evaluation component,\nwon’t provide information about why a program did or did not work. (To learn about some cost-effective\nways to conduct both process and outcome evaluations, see Appendix E: Making the Most of Your\nEvaluation Dollars.)\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n24\n\nADHERING TO EVALUATION PRINCIPLES\nSuccessful evaluations adhere to the principles of utility, feasibility, propriety, and accuracy.\n\n Utility is about making sure that the evaluation meets the needs of prevention stakeholders,\nincluding funders. To increase the utility of the evaluation, prevention planners may:\n•\n•\n•\n\nIdentify the evaluation needs of all key stakeholders\nDocument findings so that they are easily understood\nShare findings with stakeholders in a timely manner\n\n Feasibility is about making sure that the evaluation is realistic and doable. To ensure the\nfeasibility of the evaluation, prevention professionals may:\n•\n•\n•\n\nEstablish data collection procedures that are practical and minimize disruption\nAnticipate and address potential obstacles (e.g., opposition from special interest groups)\nConsider efficiency and cost-effectiveness\n\n Propriety is about making sure that the evaluation is conducted in accordance with legal and\nethical guidelines and is consistent with each community’s cultural context. To support the\npropriety of the evaluation, prevention professionals may:\n•\n•\n•\n\nRespect the rights and protect the well-being of all involved\nExamine the program or practice in a thorough and impartial manner\nDefine how findings will be disclosed and who can access them\n\n Accuracy is about making sure that the evaluation is conducted in a precise and dependable\nmanner. To increase the accuracy of evaluation findings, prevention professionals may:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nClearly describe the program or practice as well as the evaluation procedures\nGather and use information that is both valid and reliable\nSystematically and appropriately analyze all information\nJustify and fairly report all conclusions\n\n(See Appendix F: Evaluation Design, Reporting, and Lessons Learned for more information on\nthis topic.)\n\n25\n\nSPF GUIDING PRINCIPLE:\nCULTURAL COMPETENCE\nBehavioral health disparities pose a significant threat to the most vulnerable populations in our society.\nWhether manifesting themselves as elevated rates of substance misuse among American Indian/Alaska\nNatives, high rates of suicide among LGBTQ youth, or reduced access to prevention services among\npeople living in rural areas, these disparities threaten the health and wellness of these populations and of\nour society as a whole.\nTo overcome systemic barriers that may contribute to disparities, planners must be culturally competent.\nThey must recognize and value cultural differences—such as those in the health beliefs, practices,\nand linguistic needs of diverse populations. They must develop and deliver prevention programs and\npractices in ways that ensure members of diverse cultural groups benefit from their efforts.\nSAMHSA has identified the following cultural competence principles for prevention planners:\n\n Include the target population in all aspects of prevention planning\n Use a population-based definition of community (i.e., let the community define itself)\n Stress the importance of relevant, culturally appropriate prevention approaches\n Employ culturally competent evaluators\n Promote cultural competence among program staff, reflecting the communities they serve\nCultural competence is one of the SPF’s two guiding, cross-cutting principles and, as such, should\nbe integrated into each step of the framework’s implementation. By considering culture at each step,\nplanners can help to ensure that members of diverse population groups can actively participate in, feel\ncomfortable with, and benefit from prevention practices.\nIncluded in the following table are some opportunities to integrate cultural competence throughout the\nSPF process.\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n26\n\nSPF Step\n\nOpportunities to Integrate Cultural Competence\n Take steps to identify those sub-populations who are vulnerable to\n\nAssessment\n\nbehavioral health disparities and the disparities that they experience.\n Identify data gaps and take efforts to fill them.\n Develop plans to share and solicit input about assessment findings with\nmembers of these sub-populations, and describe these findings using\nterms and phrases that are devoid of jargon.\n\n Build the knowledge, resources, and readiness of prevention practitioners\n\nCapacity\n\nand community members to address disparities, as well as to provide\nculturally and linguistically appropriate services.\n Make sure that practitioners understand the role of cultural competence\nin their work, overall, and the unique needs of those sub-populations\nexperiencing disparities.\n Develop new partnerships that will help engage members of these groups\nin prevention planning efforts.\n\n Make community representation in the planning process a priority.\n Involve members of the focus population as active participants and\ndecision-makers.\n\nPlanning\n\n Identify and prioritize factors associated with disparities.\n Develop logic models that include a reduction in health disparities as a\nlong-term outcome.\n Incorporate effective prevention programs and practices that have\nbeen developed for and evaluated with an audience similar to the focus\npopulation.\n If and when misunderstandings arise, be persistent in keeping\ncommunication lines open.\n\n Implement prevention programs that target populations experiencing\nbehavioral health disparities.\n\n Involve members of these groups in the design and delivery of those\nImplementation\n\n27\n\nprograms.\n Understand that people may choose to participate in different ways and\nthat they may also have different learning styles.\n Adapt and/or tailor evidence-based practices to be more culturally\nrelevant.

To maintain positive outcomes, communities will want to sustain an effective\nstrategic planning process as well as those programs and practices that produced positive prevention\nresults. Accomplishing these dual tasks requires the participation, resolve, and dedication of diverse\ncommunity members and a lot of careful planning.\n\nSUSTAINING AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS\nThere are a number of reasons why it is important to sustain an effective strategic planning process.\nThese are some things to keep in mind:\n\n Prevention takes time. While communities are likely to achieve some short-term outcomes\n\ninitially, it can take many years to produce long-term results. When practitioners help the SPF\nprocess live on over time, communities are much more likely to make a significant and lasting\nimpact on their substance misuse problems.\n\n Substance misuse problems and priorities change. Prevention needs and capacity are always\nevolving with new substance misuse issues arising that no one can anticipate right now. With a\nwell-established strategic planning process like the SPF already in place, communities will be able\nto recognize—and respond effectively to—these important changes over time.\n\n Successful implementation of the SPF depends on collaboration. The SPF is widely\n\nrecognized by many public health funders and practitioners. Adherence to a common planning\nprocess can help planners establish a shared language across health issues and build the\ninterdisciplinary partnerships needed to make a real difference.\n\nSUSTAINING PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES THAT WORK\nA primary goal of an effective strategic planning process like the SPF is to identify the right combination\nof programs and practices to address local prevention priorities. Many factors contribute to effectiveness\nin prevention. In general, programs and practices must operate in a variety of community settings\nand influence local risk and protective factors at both the individual and environmental levels. Thus, a\ncomprehensive prevention plan might include:\n\n A school-based youth skills promotion program\n Parent education to support children’s healthy development\n Organizational/community rules and regulations that support healthy behavior\n Enforcement of rules and regulations that support healthy behavior\nSome programs and practices included in a comprehensive prevention plan are likely to work better than\nothers (e.g., they produce positive outcomes and/or receive community support). To maintain positive\noutcomes over time, it’s important to identify and sustain those prevention programs and practices that\nwork well for a community.\n\n29\n\nSPF Step\n\nHow the SPF Contributes to Sustainability\n During assessment, practitioners begin making decisions based on\n\nAssessment\n\na clear understanding of local prevention needs. They also begin\nbuilding relationships with data keepers and stakeholders who can play\nimportant roles in supporting and sustaining local prevention efforts\nover time.\n\n Intentional capacity building at all levels helps to ensure that successful\nprograms are sustained within a larger community context, and\ntherefore less vulnerable to local budgetary and political fluctuations.\n\nCapacity\n\n Effective capacity building increases an organization’s or community’s\nability to respond to changing issues with innovative solutions.\n\n Building capacity also involves promoting public awareness and support\nfor evidence-based prevention, and engaging partners and cultivating\nchampions who will be vital to the success—and sustainability—of local\nprevention efforts.\n\n When developing a comprehensive approach to preventing substance\nPlanning\n\nmisuse, communities should consider the degree to which prevention\ninterventions fit with local needs, capacity, and culture: the better the fit,\nthe more likely interventions are to be both successful and sustainable.\n\n By working closely with community partners to deliver evidence-based\nImplementation\n\nprograms and practices as intended, closely monitoring and improving\ntheir delivery, and celebrating “small wins” along the way, planners help\nto ensure their effectiveness and begin to weave prevention into the\nfabric of the community.\n\n Through process and outcome evaluation, communities can make\nEvaluation\n\nimportant mid-course corrections to prevention efforts, identify which\npractices are worth expanding and/or sustaining, and examine ongoing\nplans for—and progress toward—sustaining those practices that work.\n\n By sharing evaluation findings, planners can also help build the support\nneeded to expand and sustain effective interventions.\n\n To ensure that prevention practices produce positive outcomes for\nCultural\nCompetence\n(Guiding\nPrinciple)\n\nmembers of diverse population groups, communities must engage\nin an inclusive and culturally appropriate approach to identifying and\naddressing their substance misuse problems.\n\n Culturally competent prevention is the only type of prevention worth\ndoing—and sustaining.\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n30\n\nPUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER:\nTHE SPF AT-A-GLANCE\nStep 1:\nAssessment\n\nStep 2:\nCapacity\n\nStep 3:\nPlanning\n\nStep 4:\nImplementation\n\nStep 5:\nEvaluation\n\n31\n\nAssess risk\nand\nprotective\nfactors\n\nAssess\nproblems and\nrelated\nbehaviors\n\nPrioritize problems\n(criteria: magnitude,\ntime trend, severity,\ncomparison)\n\nEngage\ncommunity\nstakeholders\n\nDevelop and\nstrengthen a\nprevention team\n\nPrioritize risk\nand protective\nfactors (criteria:\nimportance,\nchangeability)\n\nSelect\ninterventions\n(criteria:\neffectiveness,\nconceptual fit,\npractical fit)\n\nDeliver\nprograms and\npractices\n\nBalance fidelity\nwith planned\nadaptations\n\nRetain core\ncomponents\n\nConduct\nprocess\nevaluation\n\nConduct\noutcome\nevaluation\n\nRecommend\nimprovements\nand make\nmid-course\ncorrections\n\nA\nR\n\nD\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK (SPF)\n\nT\nF\n\nRaise\ncommunity\nawareness\n\nDevelop a\ncomprehensive\nplan that aligns\nwith the\nlogic model\n\nEstablish\nimplementation\nsupports and\nmonitor\n\nShare and\nreport\nevaluation\nresults\n\nAPPENDICES\n\nAPPENDIX A:\nPRIMARY DATA COLLECTION METHODS\nData is essential to understanding the prevention problems that may exist in our communities. It also\nhelps us to determine which, if any, groups are experiencing poorer behavioral health outcomes, and to\nquantify the extent of these disparities. The more we learn about these populations, the more we can\nhelp identify those characteristics and situations that place members at higher risk for substance misuse,\nas well as those factors that might mitigate those risks.\nPractitioners frequently engage in primary data collection efforts to better understand the needs of atrisk populations not captured in standardized surveys or surveillance systems. In the following pages,\nwe provide a quick overview of three common data collection methods: interviews, focus groups, and\nsurveys. When selecting a method, or combination of methods, think carefully about which to employ\nand understand that a one-size-fits-all approach to data collection is unlikely to reveal the critical needs\nof those populations most often underserved.\nIt is also important to involve members of these groups, from the start, in the data collection process, in\nmaking decisions about methodology, developing tools and questions, and in interpreting findings. The\ngreater the involvement of community members, the greater the likelihood that data collection strategies\nand survey questions will reflect the culture and attitudes of the populations experiencing disparities.\n\nINTERVIEWS\nInterviews are structured conversations with specific individuals who have experience, knowledge, or\nunderstanding about a topic or issue about which you want to learn more. Relatively easy to prepare for\nand conduct, interviews offer practitioners the chance to find out how community members are thinking\nabout an issue or situation. Interviews can be conducted in-person or by phone. The structure of the\nconversation is also somewhat flexible. Questions and topics can be added or omitted as needed.\nKey informant interviews are conducted with select people who are in key positions and have specific\nareas of knowledge and experience. These can be useful for exploring specific problems and/or\nassessing a community’s readiness to address those problems.\nOne-on-one community interviews, typically conducted by coalition members, tend to be less formal and\noffer excellent opportunities to build relationships, raise awareness, and inform community members\nabout pressing problems and prevention efforts.\n\n33\n\nINTERVIEW PROS\n99 Low cost, assuming relatively few are\nconducted\n\n99 Respondents define what is important\n99 Have relatively short turnaround time\n99 Make it possible to explore issues in depth\n99 Offer opportunity to clarify responses\nthrough probes\n\n99 Can be source of leads to other data\nsources and key informants\n\n99 Have generally lower refusal rates\n\nINTERVIEW CONS\n33 Can be time consuming to schedule\n33 Require skilled and/or trained interviewers\n33 Have limited generalizability\n33 Produce limited quantitative data\n33 Have potential for interviewer bias\n33 May not be good for sensitive information\nunless rapport is established\n33 May make it more difficult to summarize\nand analyze findings\n\n99 Offer opportunity to build partnerships\n\nFOCUS GROUPS\nA focus group is a systematic way of collecting qualitative or descriptive data through small-group\ndiscussion. Focus group participants are chosen to represent a larger group of people from whom you\nwant information. Through focus groups, practitioners can explore prevention related topics in depth and\nparticipants can share their unique perspectives.\nSpecifically, in focus groups prevention practitioners can ask participants questions that may be difficult\nfor them to answer in writing and help them clarify their responses by asking follow-up questions. Focus\ngroups create an opportunity for rich dialogue as participants build on one another’s responses. They\nalso generate narrative information that is compelling and easy to understand.\n\nFOCUS GROUP PROS\n99 Relatively low cost\n99 Have relatively short turnaround time\n\nFOCUS GROUP CONS\n33 Can be time consuming to assemble\ngroups\n\n99 Participants define what is important\n\n33 Produce limited quantitative data\n\n99 Offer some opportunity to explore issues\n\n33 Require trained facilitators\n\nin depth\n\n99 Offer opportunity to clarify responses\nthrough probes\n\n33 Offer less control over the process as\ncompared to key informant interviews\n33 Make it difficult to collect sensitive\ninformation\n33 Have limited generalizability\n33 May make it more difficult to summarize\nand analyze findings\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n34\n\nSURVEYS\nSurveys provide standardized data that is relatively easy to manage and can be compared to other\nsurveys that use the same questions. They are beneficial in situations where you want to collect\ninformation across a large geographic area, hear from as many people as possible, and explore sensitive\ntopics.\nSurvey modes of administration can include phone, paper (mailed), and online surveys. Phone and\nmailed surveys can be expensive and time consuming to implement. On the other hand, respondents\nmay be more likely to respond honestly to questions presented in an anonymous, written survey than to\nthose posed during a one-on-one interview. Online surveys are less expensive to administer but tend to\nyield lower response rates.\n\nSURVEY PROS\n\nSURVEY CONS\n\n99 Can be highly accurate\n\n33 Relatively high cost\n\n99 Can be highly reliable and valid\n\n33 Take time to design, implement, clean, and\nanalyze\n\n99 Allow for comparison with other/larger\npopulations when items come from\nexisting instruments\n\n99 Generate quantitative data\n99 Make it easy to summarize and analyze\nfindings\n\n99 Make it possible to add more sensitive\nquestions\n\n33 Accuracy depends on who is surveyed\nand the size of the sample\n33 Accuracy is limited to willing and reachable\nrespondents\n33 May have low response rates\n33 Offer little opportunity to explore issues in\ndepth\n33 Questions cannot be clarified\n33 Offer no opportunity to build rapport with\nrespondents\n\n35\n\nAPPENDIX B: KEY FEATURES OF RISK\nAND PROTECTIVE FACTORS\nWhen identifying, assessing, and prioritizing the risk and protective factors present in their communities\nprevention planners should consider that:\n\n Risk and protective factors exist in multiple contexts.\n Risk and protective factors are correlated and cumulative.\n Risk and protective factors are influential over time.\n Not all people or populations are at the same risk.\nThese are described in greater detail below.\n\nRISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS EXIST IN MULTIPLE CONTEXTS\nAll people have biological and psychological characteristics that make them vulnerable to or resilient\nin the face of potential behavioral health issues. Because people have relationships within their\ncommunities and the larger society, each person’s biological and psychological characteristics exist in\nmultiple contexts. A variety of risk and protective factors operate within each of these contexts. These\nfactors also influence one another. Targeting only one context when addressing a person’s risk or\nprotective factors is unlikely to be successful because people don’t exist in isolation.\n\nRISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS ARE CORRELATED AND CUMULATIVE\nRisk factors tend to be positively correlated to one another and negatively correlated to protective\nfactors. In other words, people with some risk factors have a greater chance of experiencing even more\nrisk factors and are less likely to have protective factors. Risk and protective factors also tend to have a\ncumulative effect on the development of behavioral health problems, including substance misuse. Young\npeople with multiple risk factors have a greater likelihood of experiencing substance misuse problems or\nengaging in other related harmful behaviors. On the other hand, young people with multiple protective\nfactors are at a reduced risk. These correlations underscore the importance of early intervention and\nprograms and practices that target multiple, rather than single, factors.\n\nINDIVIDUAL FACTORS CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE OUTCOMES\nAlthough preventive programs and practices are often designed to produce a single outcome, both risk\nand protective factors can be associated with multiple outcomes. For example, negative life events are\nassociated with substance misuse as well as with anxiety, depression, and other harmful behavioral\nhealth problems. Prevention efforts targeting a set of risk or protective factors have the potential to\nproduce positive effects in multiple areas.\n\nRISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS ARE INFLUENTIAL OVER TIME\nRisk and protective factors can have influence throughout a person’s entire lifespan. For example,\nrisk factors such as poverty and family dysfunction can contribute to the development of mental and/\nor substance use disorders later in life. Risk and protective factors within one particular context—such\nas the family—may also influence or be influenced by factors in another context. Effective parenting\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n36\n\nhas been shown to mediate the effects of multiple risk factors—including poverty, divorce, parental\nbereavement, and parental mental illness. The more planners understand how risk and protective factors\ninteract, the better prepared they will be to develop appropriate programs and practices.\n\nNOT ALL PEOPLE OR POPULATIONS ARE AT THE SAME LEVEL OF RISK\nPrevention programs and practices are most effective when they are matched to their target population’s\nlevel of risk. Prevention programs and practices fall into three broad categories.\n\n Universal programs and practices take the broadest approach and are designed to reach entire\ngroups or populations. Universal prevention programs and practices might target schools, whole\ncommunities, or workplaces.\n\n Selective programs and practices target individuals or groups who experience greater risk\n\nfactors (and perhaps fewer protective factors) that put them at higher levels of risk for substance\nmisuse than the broader population.\n\n Indicated programs and practices target individuals who show early signs of substance misuse\nbut have not yet been diagnosed with a substance use disorder. These types of interventions\ninclude referrals to support services for young adults who violate drug policies. They also include\nscreening and consultation for the families of older adults who are admitted to hospitals with\npotential alcohol-related injuries.\n\n37\n\nAPPENDIX C:\nLEVELS OF INVOLVEMENT\nPotential community partners will have varying levels of interest and/or availability to participate in\nprevention efforts. Some may be willing to help out with specific tasks, while others may be willing to take\non leadership roles. Some participation options for prevention stakeholders are included below.\n\nPARTICIPATION OPTIONS\n No involvement. Stakeholders engage in separate activities, strategies, and policies. (For\nexample, “You do your thing, we’ll do ours.”)\n\n Networking. Stakeholders share what they are doing during interagency meetings. They talk\nabout community issues in which they all have a stake or communicate about existing programs,\nactivities, or services. (For example, “Let’s talk and share information.”)\n\n Cooperation. Stakeholders publicize one another’s programs in agency newsletters, write\nletters in support of one another’s grant applications, co-sponsor trainings or professional\ndevelopment activities, and/or exchange such resources as technology expertise or meeting\nspace. (For example, “I’ll support your program, and you’ll support mine.”)\n\n Coordination. Stakeholders serve together on event planning committees and community\nboards or implement programs and services together. (For example, “Let’s partner on an event.”)\n\n Collaboration. Stakeholders create formal agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding\nor contracts). They develop common data collection systems; partner on joint fundraising\nefforts; pool fiscal or human resources; and create common workforce training systems.\n(For example, “Let’s work together on a comprehensive plan to address the issue. After all,\nour missions overlap.”)\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n38\n\nAPPENDIX D:\nTHE SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL MODEL\nOVERVIEW\nThe socio-ecological model is a multi-level framework that allows us to consider the different contexts in\nwhich risk and protective factors exist. The model also allows us to examine how contexts interact with\none another and to choose prevention strategies that operate at multiple levels in order to achieve the\ngreatest impact.\n\nMUNITY\nCOM\nION\nLAT S\n\nP\nHI\n\nThe theory behind the socio-ecological model is that an individual does\nnot exist in a vacuum and that her/his behavior both influences and is\ninfluenced by the surrounding environment, which consists of various\nlevels. Each level operates within and is influenced by the next level.1 This\nreciprocal relationship and dynamic interaction helps us to understand\nhuman development and behavior because different risk and protective\nfactors operate within each level.2 The four levels3 are:\n\nSOCIETAL\n\nRE\n\nABOUT THE MODEL\n\nINDIVIDUAL\n\n INDIVIDUAL. Includes factors specific to the individual, such as age, education, income,\nhealth, and psychosocial problems, which may correspond with substance use. For example,\nundergraduate students who exhibit poor self-regulation, impaired control, and impulsiveness are\nmore likely to binge drink.4\n\n RELATIONSHIP. Includes an individual’s closest social circle—family members, peers,\nteachers, and other close relationships—that contribute to their range of experience and may\ninfluence their behavior. For example, youth who affiliate with deviant peers are more likely to use\nmarijuana.5\n\n COMMUNITY. Includes the settings in which social relationships occur, such as schools,\nworkplaces, and neighborhoods. For example, living in neighborhoods with chronically high rates\nof disorganization, crime, and unemployment is associated with higher risk for substance abuse.6\n\n SOCIETY. Includes broad societal factors, such as social and cultural norms. Other significant\nfactors operating at this level include the health, economic, educational, and social policies that\ncontribute to economic and/or social inequalities between populations.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nBronfenbrenner, U.

Just how much money depends\non the experience and education of your evaluator, the type of evaluation required, and the geographic\nlocation of your program or practice. But there are ways to save money without compromising the validity\nof your findings.\n\nWORKING WITH AN EVALUATOR:\n Look for a qualified yet inexpensive evaluator. Create a practitioner-researcher partnership.\n\nFaculty at colleges and universities are a good source. They might consider making the evaluation\na project for one of their classes. They may also have access to students who can act as paid\nresearch assistants, but who earn less than other evaluation staff. Make sure, however, that the\nfaculty member will be closely supervising any students who participate in the study.\n\n Look for an evaluator who may be able to get independent funding to conduct the evaluation\nthrough a separate grant or contract. This is rare but not unheard of. The chief drawback is that\nyou may have to wait, sometimes several months, to see if this can be done before proceeding\nwith the study.\n\n Explore other incentives. For example, look for an evaluator who is interested in branching out\n\nand trying new things. Sometimes an evaluator will work for less in order to have an opportunity to\ndo research on a new topic.\n\n Look for an evaluator who has experience evaluating programs like yours. Again, this will\n\nsave money because the evaluator is already familiar with instruments, design issues, and other\naspects of the study.\n\n Use a collaborative model. Having program staff assume some evaluation tasks (like survey\n\nmonitoring or data entry) reduces costs. If your organization has the capacity, also consider using\nan in-house evaluator.\n\n Ask the evaluator to price components of the evaluation. This will make it easier for you to\ndrop particular elements or make informed decisions about how to spread around the work.\n\n Estimate costs before specifying an amount in your funding proposal. If you pick a number\nat random—say, $30,000—you are going to get proposals for studies that cost close to that\namount. There may be a chance that you could get the study done for substantially less. Your\nfuture funder may be willing to help you estimate appropriate costs. Ask them to look at what they\nwant from the evaluation and provide a ballpark estimate of what it should cost. You can also hire\nan evaluator just to do a cost estimate.\n\n41\n\nSPENDING LESS ON DATA COLLECTION:\n Start small. Narrowing the scope of your evaluation will save costs without compromising\n\noutcomes. One way to do this is by limiting your evaluation to specific target audiences. For\nexample, if your program aims to affect both students and parents, you might study its impact\non only one group, then study the other group when you have more resources. Another way to\nsave money is by focusing on intermediate outcomes, since long-term outcomes are usually\nmore difficult to assess. If you are involved in a drug education program, for example, start out\nby focusing on whether program participants learn new information about drugs. Then, if you get\npositive results, you can look at long-term outcomes when more funds become available.\n\n Use existing data. Data specialists often have concerns about the quality of even the most\n\nreputable national data sources. Yet many of these data are better than what a community can\ncollect on its own without a significant expenditure of time, money, and expertise. Most national\ndata systems analyze their data and publish data reports (often available for no cost online).\nOthers will supply raw data to users, do custom data runs, and/or make their data available in\nformats (or on the Web) that allow people to generate reports tailored to their specifications.\n\n Pilot test. Save money in the long run with pilot testing—the process of trying out your data\n\ncollection instruments and procedures with a small target audience. This can reveal critical flaws\nlike ambiguous questions or interviews that take too much time. Data collection efforts (especially\nthose involving large numbers of people) should always be pilot tested before implementation.\n\n Implement with care. When collecting data, consistency is key. Communicate the importance of\nconsistency to everyone involved in your effort to ensure your results are reliable. If your results\nare not, you may need to start the evaluation process all over again.\n\n Select data collection methods wisely. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of focus\n\ngroups, surveys, and interviews. Qualitative methods tend to be less expensive than administering\na survey (depending on the population you are surveying) and can produce useful information.\nKeep in mind that investing in evaluation can actually save you time and money over the long haul.\nWith the information you learn from a worthwhile evaluation, you can focus your resources on the\nmost critical problems facing your community and the most effective countermeasures. However,\nyou are much more likely to collect this information if you partner with a knowledgeable evaluator\nwho understands your program and with whom you can work comfortably.\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n42\n\nAPPENDIX F: EVALUATION DESIGN,\nREPORTING, AND LESSONS LEARNED\nOVERVIEW\nEvaluation results are used to improve programs and practices, sustain positive outcomes, and improve\nthe community’s overall plan for addressing substance misuse and promoting wellness. But they can be\nused for other reasons as well, such as to help obtain funding and to build community awareness and\nsupport for prevention. Therefore, evaluation results need to get into the hands of the people who can\nuse them. Keep in mind that organizations don’t use evaluation results, people do. The Department of\nHealth, for example, isn’t going to use the results of an evaluation, but “Cathy Smith” in the Department\nof Health may. So, unless you get the results of the program evaluation into her hands and explain how\nshe can use them, they will sit on a shelf somewhere in the Department of Health.\nFollow these general guidelines for reporting your results:\n\n Brief stakeholders throughout the process. Try to avoid surprising your stakeholders with the\n\nresults of your evaluation. Brief them along the way, rather than waiting until the end of the project.\nPresent a draft form of your report before it goes public.\n\n Create a dissemination plan. Identify the various audiences who need to see the results\n(including the population that is the focus of the program or practice). Also, identify what\ninformation would be most useful to these audiences and how to get it into their hands.\n\n Select vehicle for reporting results. Make sure you use the most appropriate vehicle\n\n(e.g., public presentation, social media post/campaign, flyers, reports) for each of the audiences\nyou identified.\n\n Help stakeholders understand the data. Take time to review the findings with your\n\nstakeholders, discussing the ramifications of what you found. Don’t shy away from negative or\nunexpected results. Instead, use these as an opportunity to inform future efforts.\n\nSELECTING AN APPROPRIATE EVALUATION DESIGN\nThe first step in any project is to develop a plan for getting the work done. The plan for an evaluation\nproject is called the “design.” All too often, prevention planners launch into their evaluation without\ncoming up with a plan. They start thinking about how to collect data before determining what to collect.\nThis is usually followed by the statement, “Let’s do a survey.” But before choosing methods, planners\nneed to take a step back, consider the four principles outlined above, and do the following:\n\n Clarify purpose. For example, is the purpose of the evaluation to find out if the program or\n\npractice reached the focus population or to determine how well it worked to bring about change?\nPurpose should be dictated by stakeholder needs, including funding requirements, and guide all\ndecisions that follow.\n\n Develop questions. Questions should be closely tied to purpose. Some questions will provide\ninsight into implementation and others will produce information related to outcomes. When\n\n43\n\ndeveloping questions, make sure to avoid those you can’t afford to answer. Available resources\n(i.e., time, money, people) can influence an evaluation plan more than any other single factor. (See\nAppendix E: Making the Most of Your Evaluation Dollars for more information on this topic.)\n\n Select the right design. There are different ways to design, or structure, an evaluation. Some\n\nquestions are best answered by gathering data from program participants and practitioners\nthroughout the implementation. Other questions are best answered by gathering data before and\nafter the program, and/or by gathering data from non-participants as well as participants. This last\napproach allows for helpful comparisons and a better understanding of an intervention’s effects.\n\n Choose appropriate methods. There are many different ways to gather evaluation data. Which\nmethods you select will depend on what you want to learn, on your budget and timeline, and on\nwhat’s most appropriate for your focus population.\n•\n\n•\n\nQualitative methods (e.g., key informant interviews, focus groups) produce data that are\nusually expressed in words. They let planners explore an issue or population in depth by\nhaving such questions as “Why or why not?” and “What does that mean?” answered.\nQuantitative methods (e.g., surveys, checklists) produce data that are usually expressed\nin numbers. They allow planners to draw general conclusions about an issue or population\nbased on answers to such questions as “How much? How many?” and “How often?”\n\nA GUIDE TO SAMHSA’S STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK\n\n44\n\nSAMHSA\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health\nServices Administration\n\n","pages":{"startPosition":[0,4999,10000,14999,19997,24998,30001,34995,39995,45000,49999,55000,59986,64995,69996,75001,79999,84990,89998,94995]}},"html":{"comparison":{"identical":{"groupId":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91],"source":{"chars":{"starts":[3794722,3794747,3794772,3794797,3794822,3794847,3794872,3794897,3835706,3835731,3835756,3835781,3835806,3835831,3836255,3836284,3836313,3836342,3836371,3839244,3839269,3839294,3839319,3839344,3839369,3839394,3839419,3839444,3839469,3839494,3839519,3839544,3875019,3875044,3875069,3875094,3875119,3875144,3875169,3875269,3875294,3875319,3875344,3875369,3875394,3909967,3909992,3910017,3910042,3910067,3910092,3910117,3910142,3910167,3910192,3910217,3910242,3910267,3910292,3910317,3910342,3966780,3966805,3966830,3966855,3966880,3966905,3966930,4074495,4074520,4074545,4074570,4074595,4074620,4074645,4074670,4074695,4074720,4081579,4081604,4081629,4081654,4081679,4081704,4081729,4081754,4081779,4081804,4081829,4081854,4081879,4081904],"lengths":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]},"words":{"starts":[8513,8514,8515,8516,8517,8518,8519,8520,9424,9425,9426,9427,9428,9429,9442,9443,9444,9445,9446,9545,9546,9547,9548,9549,9550,9551,9552,9553,9554,9555,9556,9557,10299,10300,10301,10302,10303,10304,10305,10309,10310,10311,10312,10313,10314,11035,11036,11037,11038,11039,11040,11041,11042,11043,11044,11045,11046,11047,11048,11049,11050,12471,12472,12473,12474,12475,12476,12477,14917,14918,14919,14920,14921,14922,14923,14924,14925,14926,15146,15147,15148,15149,15150,15151,15152,15153,15154,15155,15156,15157,15158,15159],"lengths":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]}},"suspected":{"chars":{"starts":[2229,2232,2235,2238,2241,2244,2247,2250,2315,2318,2321,2324,2327,2330,2333,2336,2339,2342,2345,2360,2363,2366,2369,2372,2375,2378,2381,2384,2387,2390,2393,2396,2417,2420,2423,2426,2429,2432,2435,2481,2484,2487,2490,2493,2496,2529,2532,2535,2538,2541,2544,2547,2550,2553,2556,2559,2562,2565,2568,2571,2574,2589,2592,2595,2598,2601,2604,2607,2819,2822,2825,2828,2831,2834,2837,2840,2843,2846,2913,2916,2919,2922,2925,2928,2931,2934,2937,2940,2943,2946,2949,2952],"lengths":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]},"words":{"starts":[343,344,345,346,347,348,349,350,369,370,371,372,373,374,375,376,377,378,379,384,385,386,387,388,389,390,391,392,393,394,395,396,403,404,405,406,407,408,409,422,423,424,425,426,427,438,439,440,441,442,443,444,445,446,447,448,449,450,451,452,453,458,459,460,461,462,463,464,532,533,534,535,536,537,538,539,540,541,559,560,561,562,563,564,565,566,567,568,569,570,571,572],"lengths":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]}}},"minorChanges":{"groupId":[],"source":{"chars":{"starts":[],"lengths":[]},"words":{"starts":[],"lengths":[]}},"suspected":{"chars":{"starts":[],"lengths":[]},"words":{"starts":[],"lengths":[]}}},"relatedMeaning":{"groupId":[],"source":{"chars":{"starts":[],"lengths":[]},"words":{"starts":[],"lengths":[]}},"suspected":{"chars":{"starts":[],"lengths":[]},"words":{"starts":[],"lengths":[]}}}}},"version":3}
