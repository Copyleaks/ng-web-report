A good understanding of the structure of wood, and its properties, is helpful to achieve wise use. \n\r\n \r\n   Classification of Woods\r\n   \n\r\n   Woods are grouped into `hardwoods' and `softwoods'. The terms are not entirely correct since some `softwoods' are harder than some hardwoods'. For example tamarack (eastern larch), a softwood, is harder than trembling aspen, a hardwood. However, the structure of the wood is different for the two classes. A better classification would be needle-bearing trees and broad leaved trees.\n\r\n \r\n   How Wood is Formed \r\n      \r\n   \n\r\n   \r\n   \r\n     \r\n   \r\n   \r\n      Figure 1 - \r\n       \r\nCross-section of pine showing cells of cambium region, wood, bark and annual rings.\r\n   \r\n \r\n \r\n Annual Rings - Springwood and Summerwood\n\r\n When a tree seed germinates, it sends up a shoot of soft pith around which a layer of wood is   formed. In a temperate climate like Nova Scotia, growing seasons are well defined: spring, and summer/fall. As the young shoot grows the following year, another layer of wood is formed. \n\r\n \r\n This annual growth pattern creates a series   of circular or annual rings.When   growth resumes in the spring, earlywood (or   springwood) is formed. Springwood is usually light in colour and of   low density. It contains much of the wood tissue that conducts water up and down the tree. Wood produced later in the growing season is called latewood (or summerwood). It is usually denser and darker than springwood. A freshly cut cross-section of a tree shows a layer of earlywood and a layer of latewood which form the annual rings (see Figure 1). \n\r\n Cell Structure- Softwoods and Hardwoods \n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n       \r\n     \r\n     \r\n       Figure 2 - Cross-section of pine showing resin duct,   wood rays and cells.\r\n     \r\n \r\n Softwoods\n\r\n     Cells - Using an inexpensive magnifier, the   holes you see on the end-grain of wood are cells. These cells   are shaped like very small tubes with closed, pointed ends which are packed   closely together in rows in the radial direction (see Figure 2) usually in a   straight line from pith to bark. \n\r\n The cells are long, averaging about 3 mm   for eastern softwood species and up to one and-a-half times as long for some of   the large Western Canadian species. These are called longitudinal cells since they are arranged   with their length running parallel to the length of the tree stem (see Figure 3). The earlywood cells are generally thin-\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n       \r\n     \r\n     \r\n       Figure 3 - Longitudinal cells illustrating pits. \r\n     \r\n \r\nwalled and have large cavities while those of the   latewood have thicker walls and smaller cavities. This difference in cell wall   thickness between summerwood and springwood accounts for the differences in   density between the two layers mentioned in the previous section. Some of these   longitudinal cells provide a mechanism for passage of water or sap up and down   the tree by means of interconnecting channels through the cell wall. These   openings between cells are known as pits (Figure 3) which allow an unbroken   communication from tree root up to the crown. The cells also provide strength to   the tree stem.\n\r\n \n\r\n Rays and Resin Ducts - Two other features   appear in the magnified cross-section. The first are long, radial lines running   between the rows of longitudinal cells. These rays (see Figure 4), are composed of   horizontal cells usually in groups. In softwoods, rays are very small and are   not readily seen with the naked eye.\n\r\nSecond are resin canals or resin   ducts (Fig. 2), which appear on the cross-section interspersed among   the normal longitudinal cells. They are absent in some species, very noticeable   in others - particularly pines, and are useful in identifying these woods.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Figure 4 - Cross-section through hardwood showing rays   and vessels. \r\n    \r\n\r\nThe Cambium - Another   important element in tree growth and wood formation is the cambium. It is a single layer of living cells located between   the inner bark and the wood in both softwoods and hardwoods. All wood originates   at the cambium, except for twig and root tips. These cells are responsible for   increases in tree height and branch and root length. The cambium might be   thought of as a \"rubber glove\" enveloping the entire tree - trunk and branches. \n\r\nCells in the cambium reproduce by division and deposit identical new wood   cells on the previous layer. At the same time, bark cells are deposited on   previous bark layers on the opposite side. This is how a tree grows -layer upon   layer of wood cells being continually deposited during the growing season. Bark,   as it grows old and dies, does not become extremely thick because it is sloughed   off continually so that only very small increases in thickness occur during the   life of a tree.\n\r\nHardwoods \n\r\n    Vessels or Pores - Examining   a cleanly cut cross section of yellow birch or sugar maple, you will see a   surface that has a number of visible holes (much larger holes than in the   softwood section) interspersed within what appears to be a solid surface. These   holes are called vessels or pores (see Figure 5). They conduct water up the stem and   provide channels for delivery of food to living cells, particularly at the   cambium. They do not occur in softwood. The remainder of the hardwood substance   is largely made up of longitudinal cells similar to those in softwoods. However,   the longitudinal cells in hardwoods are usually much smaller than in softwood   and cannot as a rule, be seen with a magnifier. They are also much shorter.\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Figure 5 - Cross-section of a diffuse-porous   hardwood.\r\n    \r\n\r\nDiffuse-porous and Ring-porous Woods -\n\r\n  Because of the   presence of vessels, or pores, in hardwoods we refer to these species as porous, and softwoods as non-porous. Depending on the distribution of the pores, or   vessels, hardwoods are further divided into (a) ring-porous woods and (b) diffuse-porous woods. In maple or birch the   vessels are more or less randomly distributed across the annual ring as in   Figure 5. The maples and birches are diffuse-porous woods. In   the case of ash, elm, or oak, the vessels are largely concentrated in the inner,   springwood, portion of the ring, forming a distinct ring of their own (see   Figure 4). These are known as ring-porous species.\n\r\n  Ring-porous woods exhibit smaller vessels elsewhere across the ring,   but large ones occur in the springwood, accenting annual rings.\n\r\nRays - Hardwoods do not   contain resin ducts but they do have rays. You will recall that   ray cells run horizontally across the tree stem (cross-section) in a radial   direction. In hardwoods the rays vary greatly in character between species. In   birch the rays appear as fine lines similar to softwoods. In sugar maple the   rays are wider and more distinct, and appear as noticeable flecks on the   tangential surface. Tangential, radial and longitudinal represent the three   different directions (planes) in a piece of solid wood (see Figure 6). \n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Figure 6 - Three planes used in describing   cross-sections.\r\n    \r\n\r\nIn soft maple, they are less   distinct but appear as staggered ridges on the radial face. Red oak shows its   wide rays very clearly and, together with the large ring-oriented pores, create   the distinctive grain pattern of this species.\n\r\n  Grain and Texture \n\r\nWood grain has a variety of meanings. The most widely accepted meaning refers to the   direction that wood will split. For example, straight grain, or cross grain. Axe   handles are made from straight   grained ash.\n\r\n  Grain also describes the size and arrangement of   cells in the wood. As mentioned earlier, this feature gives oak its distinctive   appearance. Carpenters and cabinet makers use the term open grained (or coarse   grained) for some ring-porous hardwoods.\n\r\n  Diffuse-porous hardwoods and   softwoods are often referred to as close-grained (or fine grained) woods.\n\r\n\n\r\nFinally, grain can describe how a piece of lumber was sawn in relation to the   annual rings in the tree. Edge-grain (quarter sawn) and flat grain (flat-sawn)   are shown in Figure 7. \n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Figure 7 - Characteristics and slope of   grain.\r\n    \r\n\r\nTexture is another term used to describe   grain. It usually refers to the size of the cells and is described as   fine-textured, even-textured, or coarse-textured. For example, white pine is   regarded as fine-textured. The oaks are course-textured. \n\r\n\n\n\n\nVariations and Abnormal Wood \n \r\n \r\n  Being a natural substance, wood varies greatly, even within the same species. The following examples show what variations you can expect to find.\r\nSpringwood/Summerwood Content/Density\n\r\n  Variation in density in hardwoods is greatest for the ring-porous species. As growth slows, the   large vessels, or pores, in the springwood of the rings make up an increasingly   greater proportion of total wood substance. Since the pores contain large   cavities the amount of wood substance (longitudinal cells) becomes quite small.   This results in very light, low density wood.\n\r\n  Note: Density,   as will be seen in Lesson 2, is an excellent indicator of many wood properties -   particularly strength and yield, as related to the production of   pulp.\n\r\n  \n\r\n  Reaction Wood\n\r\n  \r\n  Reaction wood is abnormal wood that occurs   in the boles of leaning and crooked trees (and in branches). It results in   abnormal rings wider on one side than the other and is formed by the tree to   counteract lean. It is the tree's response to this stress and its attempt to   straighten itself. In hardwoods, this tension wood forms on the upper side of   the lean. In softwoods, this compression   wood forms on the lower side of the leaning tree.\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Figure 8a) and b) - Reaction   wood\r\n    \r\n\r\nTension Wood - Tension wood,   formed on the upper side of leaning hardwood trees, is usually   indicated by eccentric, or off-centre, growth rings (see Figure 8a). It may be   seen on cut ends as a somewhat lustrous surface, sometimes with an   uncharacteristic colour. On a piece of lumber it may often be detected by a   fuzzy or woolly surface. Tension wood may cause warping during drying, and in   general is of lower strength than normal wood.\n\r\n  When a piece containing   tension wood does break, it shows a brashy failure - ie. a   rather abrupt failure across the piece, without the usual splintering as in   normal wood. Hardwoods showing large amounts of tension wood are generally not   acceptable for products where strength is a factor, or for some grades of peeler   logs. \n\r\nCompression Wood -   Compression wood, formed on the underside of leaning softwood   trees, is usually detected by: (1) a dark, reddish, colour; (2) annual rings on   the underside that are wider than normal and appear to have a high proportion of   summerwood (see Figure 8b); and (3) a dull appearance.\n\r\nAlthough compression   wood has a higher than-normal density, it is weak in some critical strength   properties. The most serious drawback of compression wood is its abnormal drying   behaviour. When normal wood in the form of lumber dries, it shrinks in thickness   and width (by predictable amounts).\r\nIt shrinks very little (practically negligible) in length. Compression wood,   however, shrinks in length by more than 10 times that of normal wood. This   causes bowing and twisting of certain pieces of lumber. Compression wood is more   easily recognized than tension wood and should be avoided where strength is a   prime requirement.\n\r\nHeartwood and Sapwood \n\r\nWhile a tree is young the wood conducts water (or sap) up the tree, stores   food for growing, and provides strength to the tree stem. This wood is called sapwood. Later, as the tree   grows in diameter, the cells toward the centre (pith) of the stem die. This core   of dead cells around the pith is called heartwood. As the tree grows, the core of heartwood moves   outward as well.\n\r\n  There is great variability in the proportion of sapwood to   heartwood. In some woods, when the cells die and form heartwood, noticeable   changes take place. The most common change is a darkening in colour of the   heartwood. Red oak and eastern white cedar are good examples of this darkening   process while the eastern spruces, balsam fir, and other hardwoods show   practically no colour change in the heartwood. Heartwood should not be confused   with the darkening in colour due to activity of decay organisms.\n\r\n  Important   changes occur when heartwood is created by dying sapwood cells. In some woods -   cedars and white oak for example -chemicals are deposited in the heartwood cells   which impart a high degree of natural decay resistance. In other species, the   cells are completely blocked by another kind of deposit that, in turn, reduces   its ability to conduct water. This means that water is difficult to remove   during drying. For the same reason, liquid preservatives are difficult to   introduce beyond the sapwood.\n\r\nWood Identification \n\r\nWe have touched on some of the features of wood that will help with   identification. If you want to learn more about wood identification we suggest   (1) Canadian Woods. 3rd Edition (see below); (2) Forintek   Canada Corp., 319 rue Franquet, Ste-Foy, Quebec, GlV 4CF, have small, labelled   wood samples available, in boxes of 40 ($100 per box for non-members; $50 per   box for supporting members of Forintek); (3) You may wish to make up your own samples 1/4 in. thick, by 2 1⁄2 inches by 4 inches. They should be dry. With the   above noted key, or by simply observing prominent features, you will become proficient at identifying local species.\n\r\nFurther Reading \n\r\n\r\n  Haygreen, John and Kim Bowyer, 1989,\n\r\n      Forest Products and Wood Science.

Technology</h1>\n\n\n\n\t<div id=\"main-content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n \n\n\n   <p><strong>LESSON ONE: THE STRUCTURE OF WOOD </strong></p>\n\r\n   <h3>Introduction</h3>\n\r\n   <p>Lessons 1 and 2 are the most `technical' in this Module. A good understanding of the structure of wood, and its properties, is helpful to achieve wise use. </p>\n\r\n \r\n   <h3>Classification of Woods\r\n   </h3>\n\r\n   <p>Woods are grouped into `hardwoods' and `softwoods'. The terms are not entirely correct since some `softwoods' are harder than some hardwoods'. For example tamarack (eastern larch), a softwood, is harder than trembling aspen, a hardwood. However, the structure of the wood is different for the two classes. A better classification would be needle-bearing trees and broad leaved trees.</p>\n\r\n \r\n   <h3>How Wood is Formed \r\n      \r\n   </h3>\n\r\n   <table width=\"200\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" cellspacing=\"2\">\r\n   <tr>\r\n     <td><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/lgview/xfig1.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img height=\"156\" alt=\"Figure 1\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/fig1.jpg\" width=\"250\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\r\n   </tr>\r\n   <tr>\r\n     <td bgcolor=\"#BCCFBA\" class=\"style1\"><strong> Figure 1</strong> - \r\n       \r\nCross-section of pine showing cells of cambium region, wood, bark and annual rings.</td>\r\n   </tr>\r\n </table>\r\n \r\n <p><strong>Annual Rings - Springwood and Summerwood</strong><br>\n\r\n When a tree seed germinates, it sends up a shoot of soft pith around which a layer of wood is   formed. In a temperate climate like Nova Scotia, growing seasons are well defined: spring, and summer/fall. As the young shoot grows the following year, another layer of wood is formed. </p>\n\r\n \r\n <p>This annual growth pattern creates a series   of circular or<strong> <a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#2\" target=\"_blank\">annual rings</a></strong>.When   growth resumes in the spring, <strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#41\" target=\"_blank\">earlywood (or   springwood)</a></strong> is formed. Springwood is usually light in colour and of   low density. It contains much of the wood tissue that conducts water up and down the tree. Wood produced later in the growing season is called <strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#82\" target=\"_blank\">latewood</a> (or summerwood)</strong>. It is usually denser and darker than springwood. A freshly cut cross-section of a tree shows a layer of earlywood and a layer of latewood which form the annual rings (see Figure 1). </p>\n\r\n <h3>Cell Structure- Softwoods and Hardwoods </h3>\n\r\n <table width=\"200\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" cellspacing=\"2\">\r\n   \r\n     <tr>\r\n       <td><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/lgview/xfig2.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img height=\"186\" alt=\"Figure 2\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/fig2.jpg\" width=\"250\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\r\n     </tr>\r\n     <tr>\r\n       <td bgcolor=\"#BCCFBA\"><em><strong>Figure 2</strong> - Cross-section of pine showing resin duct,   wood rays and cells.</em></td>\r\n     </tr>\r\n </table>\r\n <p align=\"left\"><strong>Softwoods</strong><br>\n\r\n     <strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#16\" target=\"_blank\">Cells</a> -</strong> Using an inexpensive magnifier, the   holes you see on the end-grain of wood are <strong>cells</strong>. These cells   are shaped like very small tubes with closed, pointed ends which are packed   closely together in rows in the radial direction (see Figure 2) usually in a   straight line from pith to bark. </p>\n\r\n The cells are long, averaging about 3 mm   for eastern softwood species and up to one and-a-half times as long for some of   the large Western Canadian species. These are called <strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#85\" target=\"_blank\">longitudinal cells</a></strong> since they are arranged   with their length running parallel to the length of the tree stem (see Figure 3). The earlywood cells are generally thin-\r\n <table width=\"200\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" cellspacing=\"2\">\r\n   \r\n     <tr>\r\n       <td><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/lgview/xfig3.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img height=\"289\" alt=\"Figure 3\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/fig3.jpg\" width=\"250\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\r\n     </tr>\r\n     <tr>\r\n       <td bgcolor=\"#BCCFBA\"><em><strong>Figure 3</strong> - Longitudinal cells illustrating pits.</em> </td>\r\n     </tr>\r\n </table>\r\nwalled and have large cavities while those of the   latewood have thicker walls and smaller cavities. This difference in cell wall   thickness between summerwood and springwood accounts for the differences in   density between the two layers mentioned in the previous section. Some of these   longitudinal cells provide a mechanism for passage of water or sap up and down   the tree by means of interconnecting channels through the cell wall. These   openings between cells are known as<strong> <a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#96\" target=\"_blank\">pits</a></strong> (Figure 3) which allow an unbroken   communication from tree root up to the crown. The cells also provide strength to   the tree stem.<br>\n\r\n <br>\n\r\n <strong>Rays and Resin Ducts</strong> - Two other features   appear in the magnified cross-section. The first are long, radial lines running   between the rows of longitudinal cells. These <strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#101\" target=\"_blank\">rays</a></strong> (see Figure 4), are composed of   horizontal cells usually in groups. In softwoods, rays are very small and are   not readily seen with the naked eye.<br>\n\r\nSecond are<strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#105\" target=\"_blank\"> resin canals</a></strong> or<strong> resin   ducts</strong> (Fig. 2), which appear on the cross-section interspersed among   the normal longitudinal cells. They are absent in some species, very noticeable   in others - particularly pines, and are useful in identifying these woods.\r\n<table width=\"200\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\" cellspacing=\"2\">\r\n  \r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/lgview/xfig4.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img height=\"178\" alt=\"Figure 4\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/fig4.jpg\" width=\"250\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td bgcolor=\"#BCCFBA\"><em><strong>Figure 4</strong> - Cross-section through hardwood showing rays   and vessels.</em> </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#14\" target=\"_blank\">The Cambium</a></strong> - Another   important element in tree growth and wood formation is the <strong>cambium</strong>. It is a single layer of living cells located between   the inner bark and the wood in both softwoods and hardwoods. All wood originates   at the cambium, except for twig and root tips. These cells are responsible for   increases in tree height and branch and root length. The cambium might be   thought of as a \"rubber glove\" enveloping the entire tree - trunk and branches. </p>\n\r\n<p>Cells in the cambium reproduce by division and deposit identical new wood   cells on the previous layer. At the same time, bark cells are deposited on   previous bark layers on the opposite side. This is how a tree grows -layer upon   layer of wood cells being continually deposited during the growing season. Bark,   as it grows old and dies, does not become extremely thick because it is sloughed   off continually so that only very small increases in thickness occur during the   life of a tree.</p>\n\r\n<p><strong>Hardwoods </strong><br>\n\r\n    <strong>Vessels or Pores</strong> - Examining   a cleanly cut cross section of yellow birch or sugar maple, you will see a   surface that has a number of visible holes (much larger holes than in the   softwood section) interspersed within what appears to be a solid surface. These   holes are called<strong> <a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#133\" target=\"_blank\">vessels</a></strong> or <strong>pores</strong> (see Figure 5). They conduct water up the stem and   provide channels for delivery of food to living cells, particularly at the   cambium. They do not occur in softwood. The remainder of the hardwood substance   is largely made up of longitudinal cells similar to those in softwoods. However,   the longitudinal cells in hardwoods are usually much smaller than in softwood   and cannot as a rule, be seen with a magnifier. They are also much shorter.</p>\n\r\n<table width=\"200\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" cellspacing=\"2\">\r\n  \r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/lgview/xfig5.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img height=\"184\" alt=\"Figure 5\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/fig5.jpg\" width=\"250\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td bgcolor=\"#BCCFBA\"><em><strong>Figure 5</strong> - Cross-section of a diffuse-porous   hardwood.</em></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><strong>Diffuse-porous and Ring-porous Woods</strong> -<br>\n\r\n  Because of the   presence of vessels, or pores, in hardwoods we refer to these species as <strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#106\" target=\"_blank\">porous</a></strong>, and softwoods as <strong>non-porous</strong>. Depending on the distribution of the pores, or   vessels, hardwoods are further divided into (a)<strong> ring-porous</strong> woods and (b) <strong>diffuse-porous</strong> woods. In maple or birch the   vessels are more or less randomly distributed across the annual ring as in   Figure 5. The maples and birches are <strong>diffuse-porous </strong>woods. In   the case of ash, elm, or oak, the vessels are largely concentrated in the inner,   springwood, portion of the ring, forming a distinct ring of their own (see   Figure 4). These are known as <strong>ring-porous</strong> species.<br>\n\r\n  Ring-porous woods exhibit smaller vessels elsewhere across the ring,   but large ones occur in the springwood, accenting annual rings.</p>\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#101\" target=\"_blank\">Rays</a></strong> - Hardwoods do not   contain resin ducts but they do have<strong> rays</strong>. You will recall that   ray cells run horizontally across the tree stem (cross-section) in a radial   direction. In hardwoods the rays vary greatly in character between species. In   birch the rays appear as fine lines similar to softwoods. In sugar maple the   rays are wider and more distinct, and appear as noticeable flecks on the   tangential surface. Tangential, radial and longitudinal represent the three   different directions (planes) in a piece of solid wood (see Figure 6). </p>\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\">\r\n  \r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/lgview/xfig6.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img height=\"218\" alt=\"Figure 6\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/fig6.jpg\" width=\"250\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td bgcolor=\"#BCCFBA\"><em><strong>Figure 6 </strong>- Three planes used in describing   cross-sections.</em></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>In soft maple, they are less   distinct but appear as staggered ridges on the radial face. Red oak shows its   wide rays very clearly and, together with the large ring-oriented pores, create   the distinctive grain pattern of this species.</p>\n\r\n<h3>  Grain and Texture </h3>\n\r\n<p>Wood <strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#58\" target=\"_blank\">grain</a></strong> has a variety of meanings. The most widely accepted meaning refers to the   direction that wood will split. For example, straight grain, or cross grain. Axe   handles are made from <strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#123\" target=\"_blank\">straight   grained</a></strong> ash.<br>\n\r\n  Grain also describes the size and arrangement of   cells in the wood. As mentioned earlier, this feature gives oak its distinctive   appearance. Carpenters and cabinet makers use the term open grained (or coarse   grained) for some ring-porous hardwoods.<br>\n\r\n  Diffuse-porous hardwoods and   softwoods are often referred to as close-grained (or fine grained) woods.<br>\n\r\n</p>\n\r\n<p>Finally, grain can describe how a piece of lumber was sawn in relation to the   annual rings in the tree. Edge-grain (quarter sawn) and flat grain (flat-sawn)   are shown in Figure 7. </p>\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"200\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\">\r\n  \r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/lgview/xfig7a.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img height=\"92\" alt=\"Figure 7\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/fig7a.jpg\" width=\"250\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/lgview/xfig7b.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img height=\"253\" alt=\"Figure 7\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/fig7b.jpg\" width=\"250\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td bgcolor=\"#BCCFBA\"><em><strong>Figure 7</strong> - Characteristics and slope of   grain.</em></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nTexture is another term used to describe   grain. It usually refers to the size of the cells and is described as   fine-textured, even-textured, or coarse-textured. For example, white pine is   regarded as fine-textured. The oaks are course-textured. <br>\n\r\n<br>\n\n\n\n<h3>Variations and Abnormal Wood </h3>\n \r\n \r\n  Being a natural substance, wood varies greatly, even within the same species. The following examples show what variations you can expect to find.\r\n<p><strong>Springwood/Summerwood Content/Density</strong><br>\n\r\n  Variation in density in hardwoods is greatest for the <strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#106\" target=\"_blank\">ring-porous</a></strong> species. As growth slows, the   large vessels, or pores, in the springwood of the rings make up an increasingly   greater proportion of total wood substance. Since the pores contain large   cavities the amount of wood substance (longitudinal cells) becomes quite small.   This results in very light, low density wood.<br>\n\r\n  <strong>Note</strong>: Density,   as will be seen in Lesson 2, is an excellent indicator of many wood properties -   particularly strength and yield, as related to the production of   pulp.<br>\n\r\n  <br>\n\r\n  <strong>Reaction Wood</strong><br>\n\r\n  \r\n  <strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#102\" target=\"_blank\">Reaction wood</a> </strong>is abnormal wood that occurs   in the boles of leaning and crooked trees (and in branches). It results in   abnormal rings wider on one side than the other and is formed by the tree to   counteract lean. It is the tree's response to this stress and its attempt to   straighten itself. In hardwoods, this <strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#127\" target=\"_blank\">tension wood</a></strong> forms on the upper side of   the lean. In softwoods, this <strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#24\" target=\"_blank\">compression   wood</a></strong> forms on the lower side of the leaning tree.</p>\n\r\n<table width=\"200\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\" cellspacing=\"2\">\r\n  \r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/lgview/xfig8a&amp;b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img height=\"175\" alt=\"Figure 8a &amp; b\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/images/fig8a&amp;b.jpg\" width=\"300\" border=\"0\"></a></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td bgcolor=\"#BCCFBA\"><em><strong>Figure 8a) and b</strong>) - Reaction   wood</em></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#127\" target=\"_blank\">Tension Wood</a></strong> - Tension wood,   formed on the <strong>upper</strong> side of leaning hardwood trees, is usually   indicated by eccentric, or off-centre, growth rings (see Figure 8a). It may be   seen on cut ends as a somewhat lustrous surface, sometimes with an   uncharacteristic colour. On a piece of lumber it may often be detected by a   fuzzy or woolly surface. Tension wood may cause warping during drying, and in   general is of lower strength than normal wood.<br>\n\r\n  When a piece containing   tension wood does break, it shows a <strong>brashy</strong> failure - ie. a   rather abrupt failure across the piece, without the usual splintering as in   normal wood. Hardwoods showing large amounts of tension wood are generally not   acceptable for products where strength is a factor, or for some grades of peeler   logs. </p>\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#24\" target=\"_blank\">Compression Wood</a></strong> -   Compression wood, formed on the <strong>underside</strong> of leaning softwood   trees, is usually detected by: (1) a dark, reddish, colour; (2) annual rings on   the underside that are wider than normal and appear to have a high proportion of   summerwood (see Figure 8b); and (3) a dull appearance.<br>\n\r\nAlthough compression   wood has a higher than-normal density, it is weak in some critical strength   properties. The most serious drawback of compression wood is its abnormal drying   behaviour. When normal wood in the form of lumber dries, it shrinks in thickness   and width (by predictable amounts).\r\n<p>It shrinks very little (practically negligible) in length. Compression wood,   however, shrinks in length by more than 10 times that of normal wood. This   causes bowing and twisting of certain pieces of lumber. Compression wood is more   easily recognized than tension wood and should be avoided where strength is a   prime requirement.</p>\n\r\n<h3>Heartwood and Sapwood </h3>\n\r\n<p>While a tree is young the wood conducts water (or sap) up the tree, stores   food for growing, and provides strength to the tree stem. This wood is called <strong><a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#111\" target=\"_blank\">sapwood</a></strong>. Later, as the tree   grows in diameter, the cells toward the centre (pith) of the stem die. This core   of dead cells around the pith is called<a href=\"https://novascotia.ca/natr/education/woodlot/modules/module8/glossary.asp#64\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong>heartwood</strong></a>. As the tree grows, the core of heartwood moves   outward as well.<br>\n\r\n  There is great variability in the proportion of sapwood to   heartwood. In some woods, when the cells die and form heartwood, noticeable   changes take place. The most common change is a darkening in colour of the   heartwood. Red oak and eastern white cedar are good examples of this darkening   process while the eastern spruces, balsam fir, and other hardwoods show   practically no colour change in the heartwood. Heartwood should not be confused   with the darkening in colour due to activity of decay organisms.<br>\n\r\n  Important   changes occur when heartwood is created by dying sapwood cells. In some woods -   cedars and white oak for example -chemicals are deposited in the heartwood cells   which impart a high degree of natural decay resistance. In other species, the   cells are completely blocked by another kind of deposit that, in turn, reduces   its ability to conduct water. This means that water is difficult to remove   during drying. For the same reason, liquid preservatives are difficult to   introduce beyond the sapwood.</p>\n\r\n<h3>Wood Identification </h3>\n\r\n<p>We have touched on some of the features of wood that will help with   identification. If you want to learn more about wood identification we suggest   (1) <strong>Canadian Woods. 3rd Edition</strong> (see below); (2) Forintek   Canada Corp., 319 rue Franquet, Ste-Foy, Quebec, GlV 4CF, have small, labelled   wood samples available, in boxes of 40 ($100 per box for non-members; $50 per   box for supporting members of Forintek); (3) You may wish to make up your own samples 1/4 in. thick, by 2 1⁄2 inches by 4 inches. They should be dry. With the   above noted key, or by simply observing prominent features, you will become proficient at identifying local species.</p>\n\r\n<h3>Further Reading </h3>\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Haygreen, John and Kim Bowyer, 1989,<br>\n\r\n      <em>Forest Products and Wood Science.
