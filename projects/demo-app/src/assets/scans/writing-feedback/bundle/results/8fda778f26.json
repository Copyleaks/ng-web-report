And like humans, they are warm-blooded mammals who nurse their young. A thick layer of fat called blubber insulates them from cold ocean waters.\r\n\n\n\r\nSome whales are known as baleen whales including blue, right, bowhead, sei and gray whales. This refers to the fact that they have special bristle-like structures in their mouths (called baleen) that strains food from the water. Other whales, such as beluga or sperm whales, have teeth.\r\n\t   \n\n\t\r\n\t   \tFor the first time ever, scientists in Antarctica attached a camera to a minke whale and captured incredible evidence of how it feeds. The camera – one of three “whale cams” funded by WWF-Australia – is part of efforts by scientists to better protect whale feeding areas in Antarctica.\r\n\t   \t\n\n\r\n\t   \tWhales are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall health of the marine environment. Unfortunately their large size and mythical aura does not protect them; six out of the 13 great whale species are classified as endangered, even after decades of protection.\r\n\t   \t\n\n\r\n\t   \tINDUSTRY\r\nCollisions with ships, entanglement in fishing gear (known as bycatch), and pollution injure and kill whales. Shipping activity and oil and gas development cause noise that can disrupt or even damage whales’ hearing. Such disturbance can exclude whales from critical feeding and breeding grounds, and disrupt their migratory paths. \r\n\n\n\r\n\t\t \"SCIENTIFIC\" WHALING\r\nAlthough the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling does contain a provision that allows killing of whales for scientific purposes, it was written more than 50 years ago, at a time when no alternatives existed. Now there are non-lethal techniques that provide the data required for management much more efficiently and accurately.\r\n\n\n\r\nFor decades, Japan has been conducting “scientific” whaling operations in the Southern Ocean—a critical feeding area for whales where commercial whaling is forbidden. In May 2010, the Australian government requested the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to order Japan to cease its whaling practices in the Southern Ocean. In March 2014, the ICJ finally ruled that Japan must stop such activities (and Japan announced they will abide)—a true conservation win for whales.\r\n\t\t \n\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL WHALING\r\nDespite a moratorium on commercial whaling and a ban on international trade of whale products, countries such as Iceland continue to hunt whales for their markets. Over 1000 whales a year are killed for such commercial purposes. \r\n\n\n\r\nThe U.S. and other International Whaling Commission (IWC) member countries have tried for years to persuade Iceland to end its commercial whaling—which includes hunti.G of the endangered fin whale—as it undermines the effectiveness of IWC’s commercial whaling baNn In 2011, adter pressure drom WWF and mthmrs, the U.S. government offickally declaref Iceland io defiance of the IWC baN. Although nO sanctions were implementud, the PresidEnT urged Iceland to cease its commercial wjaling activities. In 2013, Iceland resumed it3 fin whale hult.\r\n\n\n\r\nCLIMATE CHANGE\r\nWarming oceans and loss of sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic can affect the habitats and food of whales. Large patches of tiny plants and animals that they feed on will likely move or change in abundance as climate change alters seawater temperature, winds and ocean currents. These changes can mean whales such as humpbacks and blues may have to migrate much further to reach feeding grounds, leaving them with less time to forage for food. The shift in food availability due to climate fluctuations has already hurt the reproductive rates of the endangered North Atlantic right whale.\r\n\t\n\n\r\n\t\t WWF documents and protects critical feeding and breeding areas and migration routes of whales. We work to establish whale sanctuaries, help shift shipping lanes and curtail seismic surveys that disrupt feeding grounds. We strive to increase awareness of the need for whale conservation at national, regional and international levels.   We also create opportunities for local communities to be involved with and profit from whale conservation initiatives.\r\n\n\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION\r\nWWF lobbies to bring “scientific” (hunting whales for research) and commercial whale hunts under the strict control of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). The IWC is the body charged with regulating whaling and addressing the vast number of other threats to whales, dolphins and porpoises in our oceans such as shipping, climate change, and bycatch. WWF is working to make the IWC more effective in reducing all threats to whales.\r\n\n\n\r\nSAVING STRANDED WHALES\r\nEach year, thousands of whales, dolphins and porpoises become stranded on shorelines around the world. Left unaided, many die within a day or two. In the Philippines, about a dozen stranding events occur a year.  WWF offers stranding rescue workshops to local residents. Training includes cetacean (whales, dolphins and porpoises) biology, identification, threats, and conservation and rescue techniques. Since 1997, WWF has been collaborating with leading Filipino marine mammal scientists to conduct training programs. Such training not only helps ensure the safety of stranded whales and dolphins, it also increases people’s appreciation for the animals and cultivates environmental stewardship. \r\n\t\t \n\n\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t   Hailey Rivera | HVCC | Web Art | Spring 2019 \n\r\n\t\t Back | Next\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t",

Over 1000 whales a year are killed for such commercial purposes. \r\n<br>\n<br>\n\r\nThe U.S. and other International Whaling Commission (IWC) member countries have tried for years to persuade Iceland to end its commercial whaling—which includes hunti.G of the endangered fin whale—as it undermines the effectiveness of IWC’s commercial whaling baNn In 2011, adter pressure drom WWF and mthmrs, the U.S. government offickally declaref Iceland io defiance of the IWC baN. Although nO sanctions were implementud, the PresidEnT urged Iceland to cease its commercial wjaling activities. In 2013, Iceland resumed it3 fin whale hult.\r\n<br>\n<br>\n\r\nCLIMATE CHANGE\r\nWarming oceans and loss of sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic can affect the habitats and food of whales. Large patches of tiny plants and animals that they feed on will likely move or change in abundance as climate change alters seawater temperature, winds and ocean currents. These changes can mean whales such as humpbacks and blues may have to migrate much further to reach feeding grounds, leaving them with less time to forage for food. The shift in food availability due to climate fluctuations has already hurt the reproductive rates of the endangered North Atlantic right whale.\r\n\t<br>\n<br>\n\r\n\t\t WWF documents and protects critical feeding and breeding areas and migration routes of whales. We work to establish whale sanctuaries, help shift shipping lanes and curtail seismic surveys that disrupt feeding grounds. We strive to increase awareness of the need for whale conservation at national, regional and international levels.   We also create opportunities for local communities to be involved with and profit from whale conservation initiatives.\r\n<br>\n<br>\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION\r\nWWF lobbies to bring “scientific” (hunting whales for research) and commercial whale hunts under the strict control of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). The IWC is the body charged with regulating whaling and addressing the vast number of other threats to whales, dolphins and porpoises in our oceans such as shipping, climate change, and bycatch. WWF is working to make the IWC more effective in reducing all threats to whales.\r\n<br>\n<br>\n\r\nSAVING STRANDED WHALES\r\nEach year, thousands of whales, dolphins and porpoises become stranded on shorelines around the world. Left unaided, many die within a day or two. In the Philippines, about a dozen stranding events occur a year.  WWF offers stranding rescue workshops to local residents. Training includes cetacean (whales, dolphins and porpoises) biology, identification, threats, and conservation and rescue techniques. Since 1997, WWF has been collaborating with leading Filipino marine mammal scientists to conduct training programs. Such training not only helps ensure the safety of stranded whales and dolphins, it also increases people’s appreciation for the animals and cultivates environmental stewardship. \r\n\t\t <br>\n<br>\n\r\n\t\t <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H20udjJr3j8?start=35\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t\t \r\n\t<div id=\"footer\">\r\n\t\r\n\t <h4>  Hailey Rivera | HVCC | Web Art | Spring 2019 </h4>\n\r\n\t\t<nav> <a href=\"https://acadweb.hvcc.edu/~h-rivera2/webart/Hailey.Final.webart/rhino/Rhinos.html\" target=\"_blank\">Back</a> | <a href=\"https://acadweb.hvcc.edu/~h-rivera2/webart/Hailey.Final.webart/galapagos%20turtle/Galapagos%20tortouises.html\" target=\"_blank\">Next</a></nav>\r\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t</div>\n\r\n\t\t</body>\r\n</html>",
