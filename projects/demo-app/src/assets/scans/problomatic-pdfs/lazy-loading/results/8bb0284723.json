A\ndetailed synthetic method for the preparation of the racemic 3-chloro, 3-fluoro, 3-methyl, 5bromo, and 5-chloro kynurenines has been described in this chapter. The racemic 3-chloro, 3fluoro, and 3-methyl kynurenines have been prepared starting from the corresponding osubstituted anilines. A diazotization of these anilines followed by a stannous chloride reduction\ngives the corresponding 2-substituted phenylhydrazines. Reaction of the phenylhydrazines with\nthe Michael adduct of diethyl acetamidomalonate and acrolein give the corresponding 2substituted phenylhydrazone derivatives. These phenylhydrazone derivatives are then subjected\nto a Fischer indole cyclization to give the 3,7-disubstituted indoles. Ozonolysis of the indoles\nfollowed by acid hydrolysis affords the racemic kynurenines. The 5-bromo-L-kynurenine and 5chloro-L-kynurenine have been prepared from L-tryptophan.\n\nChapter 3 includes the results and discussion of the steady state kinetic studies of the synthesized\nsubstrate analogs\nChapter 4 includes the synthesis of a caged kynurenines and its stability studies using HPLC\nChapter 5 includes Conclusions\n\nINDEX WORDS:\n\nKynureninase, Pseudomonas fluorescens, kynurenine, enzymatic resolution,\nAspergillus acylase, substituted phenylhydrazine, substituted phenylhydrazones, Fischer indole cylization, ozonolysis, hydrolysis\n\n.\n\nSYNTHESIS & EVALUATION OF SUBSTRATE ANALOGS FOR HUMAN & BACTERIAL\nKYNURENINASE AND SYNTHESIS AND STABILITY STUDIES OF CAGED\nKYNURENINE\nby\nCHANDAN L MAITRANI\nBS, University of Mumbai, India, 1994\nMS, University of Mumbai, India, 1996\n\nA Dissertation Submitted to the Graduate Faculty of The University of Georgia in Partial\nFulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree\n\nDOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY\n\nATHENS, GEORGIA\n2009\n\n© 2009\nCHANDAN L MAITRANI\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nSYNTHESIS & EVALUATION OF SUBSTRATE ANALOGS FOR HUMAN & BACTERIAL\nKYNURENINASE AND SYNTHESIS AND STABILITY STUDIES OF CAGED\nKYNURENINE\nby\nCHANDAN L MAITRANI\n\nElectronic Version Approved:\nMaureen Grasso\nDean of the Graduate School\nThe University of Georgia\nAugust 2009\n\nMajor Professor:\n\nRobert S Phillips\n\nCommittee:\n\nGeorge F Majetich\nJonathan Amster\n\niv\n\nDEDICATION\n\nTo my parents, sisters, all friends and well wishers back home and at the UGA for their constant\nblessings, encouragement and trust in me over the years\n\nv\n\nACKNOWLWDGEMENTS\nFirst of all I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Robert Phillips for his extreme patience while\nproviding me valuable guidance over the years of working in his research lab. He is one of the\nmost uniquely warm personalities I have known. From the very time I have met Dr. Phillips I\nhave always seen him as a ‘Speaking Tree’ that bends down to earth as it bears the fruits of\nknowledge. He always was extremely helpful in giving me valuable suggestions, but at the same\ntime also challenged me to think and try to figure out things myself, which turned out to be very\nbeneficial in the long run. I have always seen him as a great instructor who is very friendly with\nthe students and very approachable. I very much appreciate his treating each of us students as\nequals and never making a student feel silly for asking a question. Also, he is very\nknowledgeable about the research subjects involved. I always had the impression that he\ngenuinely wanted to help us. Above all the most positive trait that I have learned from Dr.\nPhillips is his kindness. There were several occasions when I would need some help with the\ninstruments in the biochemistry lab, and I had no hesitation to walk up to his office and ask for\nguidance. Without any exception he would always find time to help me with whatever I needed.\nHe has been my most ideal boss ever. If I am to become a boss in future I will never forget the\nattributes that Dr. Phillips possesses as a boss.\nSecondly, I would like to thank my advisory committee members Prof. Dr. George\nMajetich, and Prof. Dr. Jonathan Amster for willing to serve on the committee and provide\nvaluable suggestions and constant encouragement over the years. My special thanks to Dr.\nMajetich for giving me valuable lessons in the Organic Reaction Mechanisms class. Also, my\nspecial thanks to Dr. Amster for the valuable lessons in the Mass Spectrometry class.\n\nvi\n\nI would also like to thank the Department Head, Prof. Dr. John Stickney, as well as all\nother faculty members for contributing toward my educational and career goals in some way or\nthe other.\nI also owe huge gratitude to all my group members Austin, Bryan, Chris, Johnny, Kyle,\nNathan, Phanneth, and Sunil for their unforgettable company, and help while working in the lab.\nAlso, I would like to thank my past group members Jalandhar Borra, Dr. Santiago Lima, Dr.\nVijay Gawandi, and Dr. Bhaktavatsalam Sundararaju for their help and valuable suggestions.\nApart from all these I owe thanks to Dr. Majetich, Dr. Popik, Dr. Geng, Dr. Dore, and the\nresearch group members of all these groups for allowing me to use chemicals from their labs\nwhenever I needed. I owe special thanks to Dr. Popik and his research group members for\nhelping me with the GCMS of my samples on their instrument.\nAlso, thanks to the Department of Chemistry, and the Graduate School for continuously\nsupporting me on an assistantship over the years.\nAnd last but not the least thanks to my wonderful parents, sisters, and all my friends for\ntheir non-stop blessings, encouragement, and trust in me over the years.\n\nvii\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS................................................................................. v\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS............................................................................... x\nCHAPTER\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW........................................1\nTryptophan........................................................................................1\nCatabolism of tryptophan........................................................................2\nThe enzyme kynureninase.......................................................................6\nMechanism of kynureninase action.............................................................9\nKynurenines.....................................................................................18\nReferences.......................................................................................21\n\n2\n\nSYNTHESIS OF SUBSTRATE ANALOGS FOR HUMAN AND BACTERIAL\nKYNURENINASE.............................................................................25\nAbstract............................................................................................25\nExperimental methods.........................................................................26\nInstrumentation.................................................................................26\n\nviii\n\nResults and Discussion................................................................................................51\nReferences.......................................................................................58\n3\n\nSTEADY STATE KINETIC STUDIES OF THE SUBSTRATE ANALOGS FOR\nHUMAN AND BACTERIAL KYNURENINASE.................................................60\nAbstract..........................................................................................60\nExperimental methods.........................................................................61\nResults and Discussion........................................................................63\nReferences.......................................................................................73\n\n4\n\nSYNTHESIS AND STABILITY STUDIES OF CAGED KYNURENINE....................74\nAbstract...........................................................................................74\nIntroduction......................................................................................75\nExperimental methods.........................................................................78\nResults and Discussion.........................................................................81\nStability studies for caged kynurenine.......................................................84\nReferences...........................................................................................86\n\n5.

The\nterm ‘essential amino acid’ refers to the fact that the body cannot synthesize the amino acid but\nhas to depend on the external dietary sources. These dietary sources include meat, poultry, eggs,\nturkey, fish, milk, yogurt, cheese, sesame seeds, garbanzo beans, and peanuts. In the catabolic\npathway tryptophan is involved in the biosynthesis of several biologically active compounds2,3 in\nthe central nervous system. These biologically active compounds include the neurotransmitter\nserotonin4-6 (5-hydroxytryptamine - 2), neurohormone melatonin7,8 (N-acetyl-5-methoxy\ntryptamine - 3), kynuramine metabolites of melatonin, and the products of kynurenine pathway\nof tryptophan catabolism including 3-hydroxykynurenine (4), 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (5),\nquinolinic acid9-13 (6) and kynurenic acid14 (7). Apart from this tryptophan is also involved in the\nbiosynthesis of niacin via the kynurenine catabolic pathway. The neurotransmitter serotonin is\nCOOH\n\nNH2\n\nHO\n\nMeO\n\nNH2\n\nN\nH\n\nN\nH\n\nN\nH\n\n2\n\n1\nO\n\nNHAc\n\n3\nOH\n\nCOOH\nCOOH\n\nCOOH\n\nNH2\nNH2\n\nNH2\n\nN\n\nCOOH\n\nN\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nCOOH\n\n2\n\ninvolved in the modulation of mood, anger, emotion and appetite, and is implicated in the control\nof several behavioral and physiological functions. The neurohormone melatonin serves as a\nbiological clock that controls the sleep patterns of the individual. The metabolite quinolinic acid\nhas been found to have agonist effects on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the central\nnervous system and thus acts as a potent neurotoxin. Thus, different metabolites of tryptophan\nplay an important role in the central nervous system and in the overall physiology and behavioral\npatterns of the organism.\nCatabolism of tryptophan\nThe kynurenine pathway is the primary pathway for the catabolism of the essential amino\nacid tryptophan. Out of the different catabolic breakdown pathways for tryptophan leading to the\nformation of the bioactive compounds, 99% of the dietary tryptophan that is not used in protein\nsynthesis is catabolised by the kynurenine pathway15. In the central nervous system before\ncrossing the blood-brain barrier, approximately 90% of the tryptophan is complexed with plasma\nalbumin16 and this complex cannot cross the blood brain barrier. However, the free tryptophan17\ncan cross blood-brain barrier where it is then available for further metabolism in the brain.\nIn the serotonergic neurons and mast cells of the CNS (Scheme 1) the free tryptophan is\nacted upon by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase-2 also called tryptophan-5-monooxygenase\n(EC: 1.14.16.4). This enzyme uses molecular oxygen and catalyzes the hydroxylation of\ntryptophan to 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan in the presence of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin. The 5hydroxy-L-tryptophan is then rapidly decarboxylated to serotonin18-20 in the presence of the PLP\n\n3\n\ndependent enzyme dopa decarboxylase, also called aromatic-L-amino acid decarboxylase (EC:\n4.1.1.28). The serotonin is then converted into N-acetyl serotonin by the action of arylalkyl\namine-N-acetyl transferase (EC: 2.3.1.87). Finally melatonin21 is obtained by the action of\nacetylserotonin-O-methyl transferase (EC: 2.1.1.4) on N-acetyl serotonin.\n\nNH3\nH\nCOO\nN\nH\n\n1. O2, Tryptophan\nhydroxylase 2\n\nNH2\n\nHO\n\n2.

Acetylserotonin-Omethyl transferase\n\nScheme 1\n\nNHCOCH3\n\nMeO\n\nN\nH\n\nMelatonin\n\nIn the CNS (including the astrocytes, microglia, macrophages, and dendritic cells)\nand in the hepatic and non-hepatic tissues (including the lungs, small intestine, and placenta of\nmammals such as rabbits, rats, mice, and humans) L-tryptophan is catabolised by the kynurenine\npathway15. The first step in this pathway (Scheme 2) is the oxidative cleavage of the pyrrole ring\nof tryptophan by the action of the hemeprotein indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (EC: 1.13.11.52) in\nthe presence of molecular oxygen to give N-formyl-L-kynurenine. However, in the mammalian\nliver, the major site for L-tryptophan catabolism, the same reaction is carried out by another\n\n4\n\nhemeprotein tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (EC: 1.13.11.11). Despite both the enzymes catalyzing\nthe same reaction using a heme cofactor, there is no significant sequence similarity between IDO\nand TDO. Furthermore, it has been found that TDO stereospecifically catabolises only Ltryptophan, but IDO can catabolise the oxidative cleavage of D-tryptophan, L-tryptophan, as\nwell as the various indoleamines such as melatonin, serotonin, hence the name IDO22 for the\nlatter. The N-formyl-L-kynurenine so formed in the first step is then deformylated to Lkynurenine by an aryl formamidase (EC: 3.5.1.9). L-kynurenine is then hydroxylated by a\nO\n\nO\nNH3\n\nNH3\n\nH\nCOO\n\nTDO / IDO\n\nH\nCOO\nN\nH\n\nNH2\n\nN-formyl-L- kynurenine\n\nO\n\nKynurenine-3monooxygenase\n\nH\n\n(KMO)\n\nL-kynurenine\n\nNH3\nCOO\n\nKynureninase\n− L-alanine\n\nNH2\nOH\n\nCOO\n\n3-hydroxy anthranilate3,4-dioxygenase\n\nNH2\n\nO\n\nCOO\n\nNH2\n\nO\nOH\n\nOH\n\n3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine\n\nNH3\nCOO\n\nNHCHO\n\nL-Tryptophan\n\nH\n\nKynurenine\nformamidase\n\n3-hydroxy anthranilate\n\nCOO\n\nLiver\n+\n\nNAD(P)\n\nN\n\ns\neou\nta n io n\nn\no\nsp lizat\ncyc\n\n2-amino-3-carboxy\nmuconate semialdehyde\n\nO\n- H2\n\nAcetyl CoA\n\nCOOH\n\nQuinolinate\nCOO\n\nN\n\nNicotinate\n\nScheme 2\n\nflavoenzyme kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (EC: 1.14.13.9) to give 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine.\nSubsequent action of the PLP dependent enzyme kynureninase (EC: 3.7.1.3) on 3-hydroxy-Lkynurenine results in the cleavage of the β,γ C-C bond to give 3-hydroxyanthranilate and L-\n\n5\n\nalanine. 3-Hydroxyanthranilate is then converted by a non heme 3-hydroxyanthranilate-3,4dioxygenase (EC: 1.13.11.6) to 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde which spontaneously\ncyclizes to form quinolinate23. Alternatively, the 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde is\nenzymatically decarboxylated by aminocarboxymuconate semialdehyde decarboxylase (EC:\n4.1.1.45) and then oxidized to 2-aminomuconic acid finally resulting in acetylCoA in the\n‘Glycolysis’ pathway. In the liver, further metabolism of the quinolinate serves as the de novo\npathway to NAD(P)+. This finally leads to nicotinamide (niacinamide; vitamin B3) which can\nthus be biosynthesized in mammals at times of dietary shortage. However, quinolinic acid if\nproduced extrahepatically in excess of biosynthetic requirements, acts as a potent neurotoxin\nwith agonist effects on the NMDA receptors24 in the CNS.\n\nO\n\nH\n\nNH3\nCOO\n\nOH\n\nO\n\nKynurenine amino\ntransferase\n\nSpontaneous\nO\nNH2\n\nNH2\n\nCOO\n\n-H2O\n\nL-kynurenine\n\nN\n\nCOO\n\nKynurenate\n\nKynurenine-3monooxygenase\nO\n\nH\n\nNH3\nCOO\n\nOH\n\nO\n\nKynurenine amino\ntransferase\n\nSpontaneous\n-H2O\nO\n\nNH2\n\nNH2\nOH\n\nOH\n\n3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine\n\nCOO\n\nN\nOH\n\nXanthurenate\n\nScheme 3\n\nCOO\n\n6\n\nIn another side biochemical reaction (Scheme 3) of the kynurenine pathway, Lkynurenine is acted upon by kynurenine-oxoglutarate transaminase to give 4-(2-aminophenyl)2,4-dioxobutanoate which spontaneously dehydrates to produce kynurenate. The neuroactive\nmetabolite kynurenic acid has been found to have antagonist effects14 on the NMDA and α7\nnicotinic acetyl choline receptors. Similarly, 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine is acted upon by\nkynurenine-oxoglutarate transaminase to give 4-(2-amino-3-hydroxyphenyl)-2,4-dioxo butanoate\nwhich spontaneously dehydrates to produce xanthurenate.\nThe enzyme kynureninase\nKynureninase25 or L-kynurenine hydrolase (EC: 3.7.1.3) is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate\n(PLP) dependent enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of L-kynurenine (Scheme 4) to\n\nO\n\nNH3\n\nγ\n\nα\n\nO\n+\n\nCOO\n\nNH3\n\nO\n\nKynureninase\n\n+\n\nNH2\n\nNH2\n\nL-Kynurenine\n\nAnthranilate\n\nO\n\nNH3\n\nγ\n\nα\n\n-\n\nCOO\n\nL-Alanine\n\nO\n+\n\nCOO\n\n3-hydroxy\nKynureninase\n\nO\n\nNH2\nOH\n\n3-hydroxy-L-Kynurenine\n\nNH3\n\n+\n\n-\n\nCOO\n\nNH2\nOH\n\n3-hydroxyanthranilate\n\nScheme 4\n\nL-Alanine\n\n7\n\ngive anthranilic acid and L-alanine. This is a key enzyme in the kynurenine pathway in the\ntryptophan catabolism and catalyzes the unique β,γ-cleavage of aryl substituted γ-keto-α- amino\nacids26. The enzyme has been isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens27, Neurospora crassa28,29,\nrat liver30 and porcine liver31. It has been found that the mammalian liver kynureninase cleaves\n3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine about twice as rapidly as it does L-kynurenine26,30 while the bacterial\nkynureninase from Pseudomonas fluorescens cleaves L-kynurenine about five times32 as rapidly\nas it does 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine. Thus, L-kynurenine is the preferred substrate for the\npseudomonad enzyme while 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine is the preferred substrate for the\nmammalian liver kynureninase.\nThe two distinct types of kynureninases33 that have been shown to occur differ in terms\nof their kinetic and chemical properties toward kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine and in\nterms of their response to PLP. Of these two types, the inducible enzyme is termed kynureninase\nand is involved in preferential reaction with L-kynurenine in the aromatic and the quinoline\npathway of tryptophan catabolism. The specific activity of the inducible enzyme depends on the\nconcentration of tryptophan in the medium to such an extent that almost no inducible activity34 is\nobserved in the cells not supplemented with L-tryptophan. Thus, the cells utilize L-tryptophan as\nthe sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy for growth. On the other hand, the non-inducible\nor the constitutive enzyme is termed 3-hydroxykynureninase and is mainly involved in the\nbiosynthesis of NAD i.e. the NAD pathway of tryptophan catabolism. The specific activity of\nthe non-inducible enzyme is independent of the concentration of tryptophan in the growth\nmedium34. The inducible enzyme has low Km for L-kynurenine while the non-inducible enzyme\nhas low Km for 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine. Furthermore, it has been found that the inducible\n\n8\n\nenzyme is reversibly inactivated9 by L-alanine resulting in a transamination reaction to give\npyridoaxmine-5'-phosphate (Scheme 5) and pyruvate from L-alanine. However, the enzyme\nactivity is restored either by addition of PLP or pyruvic acid in the latter case there being a\nreverse transamination between pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate and the added pyruvate to give back\nPLP and alanine.\n\nOOC\n\nAlanine\nNH3\nEnz\n\nOOC\n\n+\n\nHN\n\nOOC\nHN\n\nHN\n\nHO\n\nHO\n\nHO\nOPO3\n\nOPO3\n\nOPO 3\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nH\n\nH\n\nH\n\nPLP bound to lysine\nH2N\n\n+\n\nOOC\n\nHO\nOPO3\n\nO\n\nN\n\nPyruvate\n\nH\n\nPyridoxamine-5'-phosphate\n\nScheme 5\n\nOn the other hand the non inducible (or constitutive) enzyme is little or not at all affected\nby the presence of L-alanine or other amino acids35a. Even then the rate of the hydrolytic\ncleavage reduces with time indicating that the product 3-hydroxyanthranilate inhibits the non\ninducible enzyme thereby regulating the enzyme action in the NAD biosynthetic pathway35b.\n\n9\n\nThe bacterial cultures that possess the inducible enzyme include Pseudomonas\nfluorescens and Bacillus cereus36, Bacillus megaterium37,38 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus39 and\nXanthomonas pruni40. Among the fungal species, Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus niger, and\nPenicillium roqueforti possess both the inducible as well as the constitutive kynureninases while\nRhizopus stolonifer34 possesses only the constitutive enzyme. The kynureninases obtained from\nyeast and the livers of mammals like dog, mouse, guinea pig, beef, and human are the\nconstitutive enzyme26.\nMechanism of kynureninase action\nThe enzyme kynureninase catalyzes the unique β,γ-cleavage of aryl substituted γ-keto-αamino acids in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism. The mechanism of\nkynureninase has been the subject of considerable interest due to the unique nature of this PLP\ndependent reaction. In one of the mechanisms by Dalgliesh et al it was proposed that\nkynureninase catalyzes the transamination of kynurenine41 by PLP to give the β-anthraniloyl\npyruvic acid (Scheme 6) which is then hydrolyzed to anthranilic acid and pyruvate or partly\nundergoes a spontaneous dehydrative cyclization to give kynurenic acid. The pyruvate in turn\nrecycles with PMP to give back PLP and alanine. But later another enzyme kynurenine amino\ntransferase42-44 was shown to be involved in the formation of kynurenic acid.\nIn another mechanism proposed by Braunstein et al45-46 (Scheme 7) the initially formed\nSchiff’s base between PLP and kynurenine undergoes a tautomerization followed by hydrolysis\nat the γ-carbonyl carbon.

The\npyruvate ketimine is then converted into alanine and PLP after tautomerization.\nLongenecker et al47 however proposed a slightly different mechanism than the Braunstein\ngroup based on their study of mechanisms of enzymes including serine dehydrase,\ntryptophanase, and cysteine desulfhydrase.\n\nIn this mechanism (Scheme 8) after the initial\n\nformation of the kynurenine ketimine, instead of the β-carbon keeping the electrons of the β,γcarbon bond, the γ-carbonyl carbon takes up the electron pair as shown by the tautomerization\nprocess to give the anthranyl anion and the aldimine of α-amino acrylate. The anthranyl anion\ncan then either before or after stabilization (as anthraldehyde) undergoes a non-enzymatic redox\nreaction to give anthranilic acid, and the Schiff’s base of alanine, the latter being eventually\nhydrolyzed to alanine with the regeneration of PLP.\nIn their mechanistic studies on kynureninase from Pseudomonas marginalis Bild and\nMorris48 suggested that the β-carbon of kynurenine must be serving as carbanion. This was based\non the formation of 2-amino-4-hydroxy-4-phenyl butanoic acid (Scheme 9) via an aldol type\nreaction49 between the incipient alanine and benzaldehyde.\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nNH2\n\nNH2\n\nCHO\n\nCOOH\nCOOH\n\nCOOH\n\n+\n\n+\nNH2\n\nKynurenine\n\nBenzaldehyde\n\n2-amino-4-hydroxy-4phenyl butanoic acid\n\nScheme 9\n\nNH2\n\nAnthranilic\nacid\n\n14\n\nEvidence for the existence of a β carbanion was also indicated by Tanizawa and Soda50\nwho reported the formation of anthraldehyde in a retro aldol reaction (Scheme 10) from the\nreduced form of kynurenine viz. dihydro kynurenine. If the γ carbanion were formed as proposed\nby Longenecker et al then the product would have been o-amino benzyl alcohol which would not\nundergo oxidation to anthraldehyde under the experimental conditions.\nOH\n\nNH2\nCHO\nCOOH\n\nNH2\n\n+\n\nNH2\n\nNH2\n\nAnthranaldehyde\n\nDihydrokynurenine\n\nCOOH\n\nAlanine\n\nScheme 10\nPhillips and Dua49 also confirmed the formation the aldol from the reaction of kynurenine\nwith benzaldehyde, which gave a 2:3 mixture of the 4S:4R diastereomers of 2-amino-4-hydroxy4-phenyl butanoic acid. Based on their findings they concluded the formation of a gem-diolate\nintermediate in the cleavage mechanism (Scheme 11). It was found by Palcic et al 51 that the εamino group of a lysine residue is involved in the α-proton abstraction which produces the\nkynurenine ketimine that subsequently serves as a sink for the electrons from the β,γ- carboncarbon bond cleavage. Thus there are two bases involved in the mechanism of the cleavage. The\nfirst in the α-proton abstraction to give the ketimine and the second in the removal of a 4hydroxy proton from the dihydrokynurenine OR the hydration of the carbonyl carbon in\nkynurenine (to give the gem-diolate intermediate). In the subsequent mechanism the tetrahedral\ngem-diolate intermediate rapidly collapses to give out anthranilic acid and the PLP enamine of\n\n15\n\nH2N\n\nH2N\nOOC\n\nOOC\nO\n\nHN\n\nB\n\nH\n\nB\n\nH\n\nO\n\nHN\n\nHO\n\nHB\n\nHB\n\nHO\n\nHO\n\nOPO3\n\nOPO3\nN\n\nN\n\nDihydro kynurenine\nketimine\n\nH\n\nKynurenine\nketimine\n\nH\n\nAnthranaldehyde\nH2N\nOOC\n\nOOC\n\nHB\nH\n\nHN\n\nOH\n\nB\n\nHB\n\nO\n\nHN\n\nH3B\nHO\n\nHO\nOPO3\n\nOPO3\n\nAnthranilic acid\nN\n\nN\n\nH\n\nH\n\nPLP enamine of alanine\n\ngem-diolate\nintermediate\n\nOH\nH\nOOC\n\nOOC\nHN\n\nHN\n\nH\n\nAlanine\n\nHO\n\nHO\n\nOPO3\n\nOPO3\nN\n\nN\n\nPyruvate ketimine\n\nH\n\nH\n\nScheme 11\n\nAlanine aldimine\n\n+\nPLP\n\n16\n\nalanine. This enamine first takes up a proton at the β-carbon to give the pyruvate ketimine that\naccepts a second proton at the α-carbon to give alanine aldimine which finally releases alanine\nand the cofactor recyles in the process.\nLater Dua and Phillips52 also showed that the sulfone analog of kynurenine viz. S-(2aminophenyl)-L-cysteine-S,S-dioxide was a potent inhibitor of kynureninase with a Ki value of\n70 nM which is about 300-fold lower than the Km for L-kynurenine. This further supports the\ngem-diolate hypothesis. Kinetic isotope effect studies53 by the Phillips group led to the\nconclusion that the rate determining step is the deprotonation of the aldehydic carbon of PLP in\nthe pyruvate ketamine intermediate to give the alanine quinonoid intermediate. Using rapidscanning stopped-flow spectrophotometry and rapid chemical quench methods54 the Lkynurenine quinonoid intermediate, and the pyruvate ketimine intermediate were detected with\nL-kynurenine as the substrate. Thus, the mechanism for kynureninase proposed by Phillips et al\nis shown in Scheme 12.\n\n17\n\nB\nO\n\nCOO\n\nO\n\nC OO\n\nH\nNH\n\nNH 3\n\nK yn u re n in a se .P L P\nNH 2\n\nNH 2\n\nHO\nOPO3\n\nE x te rn a l ald im ine\n(λ m ax = 4 2 0 n m )\n\nL -K yn u re n ine ( λ m a x = 3 6 0 nm )\n\nN\nH\n\nH\n\nB\n\nOH\nO\n\nO\n\nC OO\n\nB\n\nCO O\nH\n\nNH\nN H2\n\nNH\n\nHO\n\nN H2\n\nO PO3\n\nHO\nO PO3\n\nN\n\nN\nH\n\nH\n\nL -K yn u re n in e k e tim in e inte rm e dia te\n( λ m a x = 33 0 n m )\n\nHO\n\nO\n\nL -K y nu r en in e q u in on o id inte rm e dia te\n(λ\nλ m ax = 4 9 4 nm )\n\nR e tro -C la ise n\n\nCO O\n\nB\n\nCO O\n\nH\n\nNH\n\nNH\n\nCO OH\nNH 2\n\nHO\n\nHO\nO PO3\n\nOPO 3\nNH 2\n\nN\nH\nA n th ra n ilic a cid\n\n(S )- g em - d io late in ter m ed iate\n( λ m a x = 3 30 n m )\n\nN\nH\nE na m ine in ter m ed iat e\n(λ\nλ m a x = 3 30 n m )\n\nB\nH\nCO O\n\nCO O\n\nCOO\n\nB\nNH\n\nNH\n\nNH\n\nHO\n\nH\n\nHO\n\nHO\n\nOPO 3\n\nOPO 3\n\nOPO 3\nN\nH\n\nN\nH\n\nN\nH\n\nA lan in e ald im ine in ter m ed iate\n(λ\nλ m a x = 4 20 n m )\n\nA la n in e q u ino n oid in te rm ed ia te\n(λ\nλ m a x = 5 00 n m )\n\nP yr u va te k etim in e in te rm ed ia te\n(λ\nλ m ax = 3 30 n m )\n\nL - A la nin e\n\n+\n\nK y n u re nin a se.P L P\n\nS ch em e 12\n\n18\n\nKynurenines\nKynurenine or β-(2-aminobenzoyl)alanine was first discovered by Matsuoka and\nYoshimatsu55 in the urine of rabbits fed large quantities of the amino acid tryptophan. About two\ndecades later the structure was determined by Butenandt et al.56 In Pseudomonas fluorescens and\nsome other bacteria kynurenine is a substrate in its reaction with the enzyme kynureninase to\ngive anthranilic acid and L-alanine in the tryptophan catabolic pathway. As described above, in\neukaryotes a similar substrate viz. 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine is involved in a similar reaction to\nproduce L-alanine and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (Scheme 4). In animals including humans 3hydroxyanthranilic acid serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of quinolinic acid (Scheme 2).\nExcessive levels of quinolinic acid have been implicated in a range of neurological disorders57-58\nsuch as Huntington’s chorea, Lou Gehrig’s disease59, epilepsy60, and AIDS related dementia. An\nexcessive level of quinolinate has been shown to be present after a stroke and is responsible for\nfurther damage61. Furthermore, the brains of Alzheimer’s patients have also been shown to have\nhigh levels of quinolinate which may be responsible for the progression of the disease62. It has\nalso been shown that spontaneously hypertensive rats have a significantly higher kynureninase\nactivity in tissues63 and recently it has been established that there is close link between\nhypertension and an allele of the human kynureninase viz. K412E64. Selective inhibitors of 3hydroxykynureninase could thus be used as drugs for the treatment of these diseases. Several\nstructural analogs of kynurenine have been synthesized in the past to check for their inhibitory\nactivity. The most potent inhibitor of kynureninase reported the date is the S-(2-aminophenyl)-Lcysteine-S,S-dioxide, 8 with a Ki of 27 nM, some 925-fold lower than the Km of L-kynurenine\n(~25 μM)52, 65. The 4-bromo, 9, and the 5-bromo, 10 analogs of S-(2-aminophenyl)-L-cysteine-\n\n19\n\nS,S-dioxide were also found to be potent inhibitors66 with Ki values of 300 nM and 400 nM\nrespectively. The other less potent inhibitors in this category were the non-sulfone analog viz. S(2-aminophenyl)-L-cysteine, 11 with a Ki of 2.5 μM and the des-amino analog viz. S-phenyl-Lcysteine-S,S-dioxide, 12 with a Ki of 3.9 μM.\n\nO\n\nO\n\nNH3\n\nO\n\nO\n\nS\n\nNH3\nBr\n\nS\nCOO\n\nNH2\n\nBr\n\nCOO\nNH2\n\nNH2\n\n10\n\n9\n\nNH3\n\nO\n\nO\n\nS\n\nO\n\nO\n\nNH3\n\nNH3\n\nS\n\nS\nCOO\n\nCOO\n\nCOO\nH2N\n\nNH2\n\n13\n\n12\n\n11\n\nO\n\nNH3\n\nS\n\nCOO\n\n8\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nNH3\n\nHO\n\nH\n\nNH3\n\nH\n\nOH\n\nNH3\n\nS\nCOO\n\nCOO\n\nO2N\n\nCOO\n\nNH2\n\n14\n\nHO\n\nNH2\n\n16\n\n15\n\nH\n\nH\n\nNH3\n\nOH\n\nNH3\n\nBr\n\nBr\n\nCOO\n\nCOO\nNH2\n\n17\n\nNH2\n\n18\n\n20\n\nAlso, the 4-amino and the 4-nitro sulfone analogs viz.

The diastereomeric 4R, 15\nand 4S, 16 dihydro kynurenines, have also been shown by Phillips et al49 to be potent inhibitors\nof kynureninase with Ki values of 1.4 μM, and 0.3 μM respectively. The 5-bromo analogs of the\ndihydrokynurenines have also been shown by Heiss et al66 to possess good inhibitory activity\nwith Ki values of 55 nM and 170 nM respectively for the 4R, 17 and the 4S, 18 diastereomers.\nIn chapter 2 of this dissertation the synthesis of a new class of substrate analogs of\nkynurenines has been described.\n\n21\n\nReferences\n1.

The DL analogs have been synthesized starting from\nacrolein. Reaction of acrolein with the diethyl acetamidomalonate anion gives the Michael\nadduct1-4 which on treatment with the corresponding 2-halosubstituted phenylhydrazine5-11 yields\na phenylhydrazone derivative2. The different 2-halosubstituted pehnylhydrazones are then\nsubjected to a Fischer indole cyclization to give the 7-halosubstituted indolylmethylacetamido\nmalonates12-16. An ozonolysis of these indole compounds give the respective diethyl-2-amino-3halobenzoylmethylacetamidomalonates which upon acid hydrolysis produce the racemic 3-halo\nsubstituted kynurenines. The 5-substituted kynurenines17 have been synthesized from Ltryptophan via first the ozonolysis of the methyl ester of Nα-acetyl-L-tryptophan followed by\nTFA hydrolysis and acylation of the intermediate to give the methyl ester of Nα,Ndiacetylkynurenine. This intermediate on bromination or chlorination, followed by acid\nhydrolysis produces the respective 5-halosubstituted-L-kynurenines.\n\n26\n\nExperimental methods\nInstrumentation\n1\n\nHNMR ,13CNMR, and 19FNMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 400MHz instrument.\n\nTwo different deuterated solvents were used for the different products. Of these, the 2substituted phenylhydrazine, the phenylhydrazone derivative, the diethyl-7-substituted\nindolylmethylacetamidomalonate,\n\nand\n\nthe\n\n2-amino3-substituted\n\nbenzoylmethylacetamidomalonate intermediates were tested in deuterated methanol, while the\nultimate substituted kynurenines were tested in deuterated water containing 1 – 2 % of DCl.\nHPLC measurements were carried out on a Spectrasystem P 2000 instrument connected to a UV\n6000 detector and controlled by a Dell PC using Chromquest software. A gradient elution was\nused consisting of 5 % MeOH, and 95 % 0.1 % aq. acetic acid from 0 – 5 mins. followed by a\nprogrammed increase of MeOH percentage from 5% to 70% over 5 – 20 mins. with a\ncorresponding decrease of the percentage of 0.1 % aq. acetic acid from 95% to 30% over the\nsame time period. This is followed by an increase of MeOH percentage to 100% with the\ncorresponding decrease of the percentage of 0.1% aq. acetic acid to 0% over 20 – 25 mins. And\nfinally, a programmed return back of the elution system to 5% MeOH, and 95% of 0.1% aq.\nacetic acid over the period from 25 – 30 mins. A 100 μM solution of the individual substituted\nkynurenines in 1 mM HCl was used for injection. Chiral HPLC of the DL-3-methylkynurenine\nwas done using a chiral Pro-Cu column (5μ, 4.5 x 250 mm) and a 1 mM aq. CuSO4 solution was\nused as the eluant. Elution for both columns was done with a flow rate of 1ml/min. with\ndetection by absorbance at 254 nm and 370 nm. GCMS of the intermediate compounds was done\non a Shimadzu instrument in Prof. Dr. V. Popik’s lab in the Chemistry Department.\n\n27\n\nSynthesis of 2-chlorophenyl hydrazine6,18-20\nTake 10 g of 2-chloroaniline hydrochloride (prepared by dissolving 10 ml of 2chloroaniline in 100 ml acetone and adding 14 ml conc.

These aniline compounds are first diazotized by the regular\nprocedures using sodium nitrite in a conc. HCl system to give the corresponding diazonium salts.\nReduction of the diazonium salts with stannous chloride11 gives the 2-substituted\nphenylhydrazines6,18-20, 22-30. The 2-substituted phenylhydrazines are stable as hydrochloride\nsalts, and the free bases are generated only when they are to be used immediately in the\nrespective further reactions. Furthermore, isolation of the free base of the 2-substituted\nphenylhydrazines is done by a solvent extraction method using ether as the extracting solvent.\nUse of ethyl acetate should be avoided owing to the enhanced potential of the substituted\nphenylhydrazines to attack nucleophilically (the α-effect) on the carbonyl carbon of ethyl acetate\nto produce a hydrazide impurity. The free bases forms of the 2-substituted phenylhydrazines are\ngenerated by treating the hydrochloride salt with a strong base like NaOH or KOH. GCMS of the\nfree base forms of the 2-substituted phenylhydrazines shows about 98% purity and are used as\nsuch for the next step without further purification.\nIn order to synthesize the phenylhydrazone derivatives from the substituted\nphenylhydrazines, the carbonyl compound required for the reaction is first synthesized by a\n\n52\n\n1.

The\nintermediate aldehyde of this reaction is not isolated and is used as such for its reaction with the\n2-substituted phenylhydrazine to give the corresponding phenylhydrazone derivative. GCMS of\nthe substituted phenylhydrazones shows about 97% purity and are used as such for the next step\nwithout further purification.\nThe phenylhydrazone derivative is then subjected to an acid catalyzed Fischer indole\ncyclization to give the corresponding 7-substituted indolylmethylacetamidomalonates12-16 as\ngummy\n\nsemisolids.\n\nPurity\n\ncheck\n\nby\n\nGCMS\n\nshow\n\nthe\n\n7-substituted\n\nindolylmethylacetamidomalonates to be about 95% pure and are used as such for the next\nreaction.\nOzonolysis of the 7-substituted indolylmethylacetamidomalonate intermediate in\nmethanol\n\nproduces\n\nthe\n\ndiethyl\n\n2-amino-3-substitutedbenzoylmethylacetamidomalonate\n\nintermediate as either a brown oil or a semisolid which is crystallized from 2-propanol to give a\nyellow\n\nsolid.\n\nFinally,\n\nhydrolysis\n\nof\n\nthe\n\ndiethyl\n\n2-amino-3-substituted\n\nbenzoylmethylacetamidomalonate intermediate with 6N HCl produces the corresponding 3substituted DL-kynurenine. The racemic compound is isolated from an aq. solution, as a pale\nyellow solid by adjusting the pH to approximately 6.5. In the case of 3-fluoro kynurenine the\nracemic compound was obtained as a brown solid.\nPurity of the racemic 3-chloro (λmax at 262 nm and 365 nm), 3-fluoro (λmax at 258 nm and\n360 nm), and the 3-methyl (λmax at 259 nm and 362 nm) kynurenines is about 99.5% by HPLC.\nThe retention times for these three compounds are 14.7 mins., 8.7 mins., and 13.5 mins.\nrespectively. The racemic 3-methylkynurenine when run on the Pro-Cu chiral column separated\n\n54\n\nthe two enantiomers with the retention times for the D and the L enantiomers being 26 mins. and\n31 mins. respectively.

The retention times for these three peaks\nare 6.4 mins., 15.5 mins., and 20.5 mins. respectively. We suspect the impurities to have possibly\nformed by partly removal of the bromo group and partly its migration to some other carbon on\nthe aromatic ring. Recrystallization of this crude 3-bromokynurenine from methanol partially\nremoved these impurities and raised the HPLC purity of the sample to about 92%.\n\n55\n\nFor synthesizing the 5-bromo, and 5-chloro L-kynurenines, the intermediate methyl ester\nof Nα,N-diacetylkynurenine is first synthesized (Scheme 14). Thus, Fischer esterification of Ltryptophan with methanol in the presence of sulfuric acid gives the methyl ester of L-tryptophan,\nwhich is about 99% pure by GCMS and used as such for the acylation step. Acylation with acetic\nanhydride in THF produces the methyl ester of Nα-acetyl-L-tryptophan which is about 99% pure\nby GCMS and used as such for the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of the methyl ester of Nα-acetylL-tryptophan, followed by hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid, and then acylation with acetic\nanhydride, gives the methyl ester of Nα,N-diacetylkynurenine17 as a white solid with 99% purity\nby GCMS. Having prepared the methyl ester of Nα,N-diacetylkynurenine, either bromination or\nchlorination\n\ngives\n\nthe\n\nmethyl\n\nester\n\nof\n\nthe\n\ncorresponding\n\n5-halosubstituted-Nα,N-\n\ndiacetylkynurenine which finally upon acid hydrolysis give the 5-halosubstituted-L-kynurenines.\n(Scheme 15)\nBromination of the methyl ester of Nα,N-diacetylkynurenine is done with liquid\nbromine, and gives regioselectively the methyl ester of 5-bromo-Nα,N-diacetylkynurenine. This\ncompound upon crystallization from methanol gives the product as pale yellow needles with\n99.5% purity by GCMS. Finally hydrolysis of the 5-bromo intermediate with 6N HCl gives the\n5-bromo-L-kynurenine as a pale yellow solid. The reported melting point for this solid is 213217 oC17. However, we got a much higher melting point of 225-227 oC which could be because\nof the greater purity of our sample. The greater purity of our sample could be because of the\ndifferent isolation method used by us. The HPLC purity was found to be about 99.8%, with the\nretention time being 14.4 mins. and λmax of 265 nm and 370 nm.\n\n56\n\nO\n\nNHCOCH3\n\nO\n\nNHCOCH3\n\nBr\nCOOMe\n\nCOOMe\n\nBr2 / CH3COONa\n\nNHCOCH3\n\nNHCOCH3\n\nMethyl ester of Nα ,Ν -diacetylL-kynurenine\n\nMethyl ester of Nα ,Ν -diacetyl\n-5-bromo-L-kynurenine\n6N HCl / Reflux\n4 hrs.\n\nNCS / AcOH / HCl\n\nO\n\nO\n\nNHCOCH3\n\nNH3\n\nBr\n\nCl\n\nCOO\n\nCOOMe\nNHCOCH3\n\nMethyl ester of Nα ,Ν -diacetyl\n-5-chloro-L-kynurenine\n\nNH2\n\n6N HCl / Reflux\n4 hrs.\n\n5-bromo-L-kynurenine\n\nO\n\nNH3\n\nCl\nCOO\nNH2\n\n5-chloro-L-kynurenine\n\nScheme 15\n\nChlorination of the methyl ester of Nα,N-diacetylkynurenine was done with ‘in situ’\ngenerated chlorine gas (by the reaction between NCS and acetic acid pre-bubbled with dry HCl\ngas)\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nreaction\n\nregioselectively\n\ngives\n\nthe\n\nmethyl\n\nester\n\nof\n\n5-chloro-Nα,N-\n\ndiacetylkynurenine.

All the synthesized compounds viz. the 3chloro-DL-kynurenine,\n\n3-fluoro-DL-kynurenine,\n\n3-methyl-DL-kynurenine,\n\n5-bromo-L-\n\nkynurenine, and the 5-chloro-L-kynurenine have good substrate activity for both human as well\nas Pseudomonas fluorescens kynureninase. For the human enzyme, 3-chloro-DL-kynurenine, 5bromo-L- kynurenine, and the 5-chloro-L-kynurenine have closely comparable kcat and kcat/Km\nvalue to that of the natural substrate 3-hydroxykynurenine. And for the bacterial enzyme, 3fluoro-DL-kynurenine, 5-bromo-L-kynurenine, and the 5-chloro-L-kynurenine have closely\ncomparable kcat and kcat/Km value to that of the natural substrate L-kynurenine. Thus, 5-bromoL-kynurenine, and the 5-chloro-L-kynurenine seem to be good substrates for both human as well\nas bacterial enzyme.\n\n61\n\nExperimental Methods\nGeneral\n\nThe steady state kinetic measurements were performed on a Varian Cary 1E UV/Visible\nspectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier-type 6 x 6 thermoelectric cell block for temperature\ncontrol. The instrument was controlled by a PC using software provided by Varian Instruments.\nEnzyme assay\n\nKynureninase activity was measured from the decrease in absorbance at 360 nm (∆ε =\n4500 M-1.cm-1)1 upon conversion of kynurenine to anthranilic acid. Similarly the human enzyme\nactivity was measured from the decrease in absorbance at 370 nm upon conversion of DL-3hydroxykynurenine to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid. The reaction mixtures for these measurements\ncontained 100 μM of the substrate L-kynurenine or 3-hydroxy- DL-kynurenine in 30 mM of\npotassium phosphate buffer pH 8, containing 40 μM of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate at 25 oC. Kinetic\nand scanning kinetic measurements of the L-compounds was done in a similar manner but for the\nDL compounds a final concentration of 200 μM of each compound was used for the individual\nassay, while keeping the other conditions same.\nKinetic measurements\n\nThe scanning kinetic measurements to determine the absorbance change for the 3substituted substrate analogs was done using the human enzyme since 3-hydroxykynurenine is\nthe natural substrate for the human enzyme. The scanning kinetic measurements to determine\nthe absorbance change for the 5-substituted substrate analogs was done using the Pseudomonas\nfluorescens enzyme since 5-substitued kynurenines have been shown to be good substrates2 for\n\n62\n\nthe P. fluorescens enzyme. The wavelength range used for the scanning kinetic measurements\nwas 450 nm – 220 nm and the scan was performed at the rate of 200 nm/min. As shown in Table\n3.1 below, different quantities of the human and P. fluorescens enzyme were used for different\nsubstrate analogs with the final volume of 600 μL for each assay solution. These same quantities\nof enzyme were used for determining the initial rates of the respective substrate analogs with the\ntwo different enzymes.\nTable 3.1\n\nHuman enzyme\n\nP. fluorescens enzyme\n\nmg\n\nmg\n\n3-chloro-DL-kynurenine\n\n3.29 x 10-3\n\n1.33 x 10-3\n\n3-fluoro-DL-kynurenine\n\n6.58 x 10-3\n\n3.33 x 10-4\n\n3-methyl-DL-kynurenine\n\n6.58 x 10-3\n\n6.66 x 10-4\n\n5-bromo-L-kynurenine\n\n1.32 x 10-3\n\n3.33 x 10-5\n\n5-chloro-L-kynurenine\n\n2.63 x 10-3\n\n3.33 x 10-5\n\nCompound\n\nThe initial rates of reaction of 3-chloro-DL-kynurenine were measured at its absorption\nmaximum, 365 nm (∆ε = 4648 M-1.cm-1). The initial rates of reaction of 3-fluoro-DL-kynurenine\nwere measured at its absorption maximum, 360 nm (∆ε = 3053 M-1.cm-1). The initial rates of\nreaction of 3-methyl-DL-kynurenine were measured at its absorption maximum, 362 nm (∆ε =\n3440 M-1.cm-1). The initial rates of reaction of 5-bromo-L-kynurenine were measured at its\nabsorption maximum, 370 nm (∆ε = 4006 M-1.cm-1). And the initial rates of reaction of 5-chloroL-kynurenine were measured at its absorption maximum, 370 nm (∆ε = 4330 M-1.cm-1). The Km,\n\n63\n\nVmax, and Vmax/Km were determined by fitting of the initial rate data (See Appendix 1 for tables\nof raw data) into the equation 1 using the compiled FORTRAN program HYPER of Cleland3 on\na Dell personal computer.\nν = Vmax [S]/(Km + [S])\n\n(1)\n\nThe values of Vmax, and Vmax/Km were divided by the respective extinction coefficients and by\nthe enzyme concentration to give the kcat and kcat/Km values (Tables 3.2 & 3.3)\nResults and discussion\n\nA representative scan graph for 5-bromo-L-kynurenine is shown below in Fig. 10 (Xaxis shows the wavelength in nm, Y-axis shows the absorbance) which shows the λmax of 370 nm\nfor this compound. The other scan graphs are shown in the Appendix section. The reaction\nshows clear isosbestic points at 245 nm, 258 nm, 280 nm, and 338 nm indicating that there are\nonly two species in the reaction viz. 5-bromo-L-kynurenine and the product, 5-bromoanthranilate\nas shown below.\n\nO\n\nNH3\n\nBr\n\nBr\nCOO\nNH2\n\n5-bromo-L-kynurenine\n\nCOO\n\nKynureninase\n\nNH3\n\n+\nNH2\n\n5-bromoanthranilate\n\nCOO\n\nL-alanine\n\n64\n\nAs seen from tables 3.2 and 3.3 the human as well as the P. fluorescens enzyme have\nabout the same catalytic turnover number for 3-chloro-DL-kynurenine with kcat values of 0.67\nsec-1 and 0.71 sec-1 respectively. When compared with the natural substrate (3hydroxykynurenine5) 3-chloro-DL-kynurenine is about 5-fold less efficiently cleaved by the\nhuman enzyme but has a 3-fold higher kcat than L-kynurenine for the same enzyme. For the\nbacterial enzyme it is found that 3-chloro-DL-kynurenine has a kcat value that is 22-fold lower\nthan the natural substrate, L-kynurenine, 17-fold lower than 5-bromo-L-kynurenine, 13-fold\nlower than 5-chloro-L-kynurenine, and 15-fold lower than 3-bromo-L-kynurenine2 for the same\nenzyme. Thus the turnover number with the 3-Cl substituent is much less affected with the\n\n2.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\n0.6\n\n0.1\n220\n\n270\n\n320\n\n-0.4\n\nFig. 10\n\n370\n\n420\n\n65\n\nhuman enzyme than with the bacterial enzyme. This is consistent with the preference of the\nhuman enzyme for 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine.\nThe kcat/Km for 3-chloro-DL-kynurenine is also about the same i.e. (8.16 ± 1.34) x 103 and (1.05\n± 0.075) x 104 for the human and the bacterial enzyme respectively. Considering no interference\n\nby the D enantiomer the value of kcat/Km for 3-chloro-L-kynurenine would be (1.63 ± 0.27) x 104\nand (2.1 ± 0.15) x 104 for the human and the bacterial enzyme, respectively.

To conclude, 3-chloro-DL-kynurenine has about the same substrate\n\n67\n\nactivity for both the human as well as the bacterial enzyme but not better than the natural\nsubstrate for each of these enzymes.\nIn the case of 3-fluoro-DL-kynurenine the kcat for the bacterial enzyme is about 34-fold\ngreater (6.88 sec-1) than that for the human enzyme (0.23 sec-1). For the human enzyme this kcat\nvalue of 0.23 sec-1 is about the same as that of L-kynurenine but about 15-fold lower than that of\nthe natural substrate 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine5. Thus, the human enzyme seems to be very\nspecific about the type of substituent at the 3-position, a larger and polar substituent being the\nbest. On the other hand, for the bacterial enzyme the kcat value of 6.88 sec-1 is about half that of\nthe natural substrate L-kynurenine4 but about the same as that of 5-bromo, 3-bromo, and 5chloro-L-kynurenines. Thus, the catalytic turnover number of this substrate with the bacterial\nenzyme does not seem to be affected as much as with the human enzyme by the presence of a 3F substituent. The kcat/Km values for 3-fluoro-DL-kynurenine are (2.66 ± 0.45) x 103 and (8.99 ±\n0.78) x 104 respectively for the human and bacterial enzyme. Assuming that the D enantiomer\ndoes not affect the enzyme activity the value of kcat/Km for 3-fluoro-L-kynurenine would be (5.32\n± 0.9) x 103 and (1.80 ± 0.16) x 105 for the human and the bacterial enzyme respectively.\nApparently, the kcat/Km value for this substrate is about 34-fold higher with the bacterial enzyme\nthan with the human enzyme. For the human enzyme this kcat/Km value of (5.32 ± 0.9) x 103 is\nabout 46-fold lower that for the natural substrate 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine5 (2.46 x 105) but about\n11-fold higher than L-kynurenine for the same enzyme.5 Thus, based on the discussion in the\nprevious paragraph, it can be said that the human enzyme prefers a 3-Cl over 3-F, both of which\nare obviously better than having no substituent on the aromatic ring, but at the same time both of\nthem are not as good as having a 3-OH substituent because of the capability of the –OH group to\nundergo H-bonding as indicated by the crystal structure studies5. For the bacterial enzyme,\n\n68\n\nhowever, the kcat/Km value of (1.80 ± 0.16) x 105 is just about 3-fold lower that of the natural\nsubstrate L-kynurenine4 (6 x 105) but about 18-fold lower than that of 5-bromo-L-kynurenine,\n10-fold lower than that of 5-chloro-L-kynurenine and actually about 33-fold higher than that of\n3-bromo-L-kynurenine2. Thus, based on the previous discussion, it can be said that unlike the\nhuman enzyme, the catalytic efficiency of the bacterial enzyme is not affected much by\nintroducing a 3-F substituent but this catalytic efficiency is not better than having a 5-Br or 5-Cl\nsubstituent although it is better than having a 3-Br substituent. Thus, only a small substituent\nsuch as H or F is optimal for bacterial kynureninase, which is consistent with our recently\nproposed model of substrate specificity5.\nIn the case of 3-methyl-DL-kynurenine, the turnover number with the bacterial enzyme is\n5-fold better than with the human enzyme, as seen from the kcat values of 0.33 sec-1 and 1.51 sec-1\nfor the human and bacterial enzyme, respectively. For the human enzyme, this kcat value of 0.33\nsec-1 is about the same as that of L-kynurenine but about 11-fold lower than that of the natural\nsubstrate 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine5. Thus, based on the previous discussion, it seems like the\nturnover ability of the human enzyme is better when having a 3-methyl rather than a 3-F, but not\nas good as having a 3-Cl though all three have a lower turnover number than the natural\nsubstrate3-hydroxkynurenine5. On the other hand, with the bacterial enzyme the kcat value of\n1.51 sec-1 is about 11-fold lower than that of the natural substrate L-kynurenine4 and about 8-fold\nlower that of 5-bromo-L- & 3-bromo-L-kynurenine2, and about 5-fold lower than that of 3fluoro-DL- & 5-chloro-L- kynurenines. Thus the turnover number of the bacterial enzyme is less\naffected with having a 3-Me than having a 3-Cl, although both of these lower the turnover\nnumber than for the substrate with a 3-F substituent. Considering the kcat/Km values for this\nsubstrate we found these to be (1.81 ± 0.15) x 103 and (2.24 ± 0.33) x 104 for the human and the\n\n69\n\nbacterial enzyme respectively. Thus, the catalytic efficiency of the bacterial enzyme is about 12fold better than the human enzyme for this substrate. Assuming that the D enantiomer does not\naffect the enzyme activity the value of kcat/Km for 3-methyl-L-kynurenine would be (3.62 ± 0.3)\nx 103 and (4.48 ± 0.65) x 104 for the human and the bacterial enzyme, respectively. For the\nhuman enzyme, this kcat/Km value of (3.62 ± 0.3) x 103 is about 68-fold lower that for the natural\nsubstrate 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine5 (2.46 x 105) but about 8-fold higher than L-kynurenine for\nthe same enzyme.5 Thus, the catalytic efficiency of the human enzyme is reduced to a greater\nextent by having a 3-methyl substituent rather than having a 3-Cl or a 3-F substituent, all of the\nthree being better than having no substituent on the aromatic ring of kynurenine but not as good\nas having a 3-OH substituent, probably because the 3-OH forms an H-bond with Asn-333.5 For\nthe bacterial enzyme the kcat/Km value of (4.48 ± 0.65) x 104 is about 14-fold lower than that of\nthe natural substrate L-kynurenine4 (6 x 105) but about 73-fold lower than that of 5-bromo-Lkynurenine, 40-fold lower than that of 5-chloro-L-kynurenine and actually about 8-fold higher\nthan that of 3-bromo-L-kynurenine2. Thus, the catalytic efficiency of the bacterial enzyme is\nbetter when having a 3-methyl rather than a 3-Cl, both of them not better than having 3-F, 5-Br\nor 5-Cl substituent.\nConsidering the activity of 5-bromo-L-kynurenine, we have found the kcat values for this\nsubstrate to be 0.63 sec-1 and 11.9 sec-1 for the human and bacterial enzyme respectively.\nAlthough Heiss et al2 have reported a kcat value of 2.1 sec-1 for the bacterial enzyme we got about\n6-fold higher kcat of 11.9 sec-1. This could most probably be due to the greater purity of our\nsubstrate as indicated by its much higher melting point than the one reported previously2. For the\nhuman enzyme this kcat value of 0.63 sec-1 is about the 3-fold higher than that of L-kynurenine\nbut about 6-fold lower than that of the natural substrate 3-hydroxkynurenine5. Thus the catalytic\n\n70\n\nturnover number of the human enzyme is almost equal when having a 5-Br or a 3-Cl substituent\nbut lowered to a greater extent when having a 3-F or 3-methyl substituent although all of the four\nbeing less active than the natural substrate 3-hydroxykynurenine. With the bacterial enzyme the\nkcat value of 11.9 sec-1 is about the same as that of 3-bromo-L-kynurenine2, 5-chloro-Lkynurenine and the natural substrate L-kynurenine4 but about 8-fold higher than 3-methyl and\n16-fold higher than 3-Cl. Thus, the turnover number of the bacterial enzyme does not seem to\nlowered as much as when having a 3-methyl or a 3-Cl substituent. Considering the catalytic\nefficiency of this substrate for both enzymes we got the kcat/Km values of (1.51 ± 0.11) x 104 and\n(3.29 ± 0.87) x 106 for the human and the bacterial enzyme respectively. For the bacterial\nenzyme, we got an 18-fold higher kcat/Km value than the value of 1.8 x 105 reported earlier2\nwhich could again be due to the greater purity of our substrate and the enzyme sample. For the\nhuman enzyme this kcat/Km value of (1.51 ± 0.11) x 104 is about 16-fold lower than for the\nnatural substrate 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine5 (2.46 x 105) but about 32-fold higher than Lkynurenine for the same enzyme.5 Thus, the catalytic efficiency with the human enzyme is about\nthe same when having a 5-Br or a 3-Cl substituent which is better than having a 3-methyl or a 3fluoro substituent but all four are not better than having a 3-OH substituent. For the bacterial\nenzyme the kcat/Km value of (3.29 ± 0.87) x 106 is about 6-fold higher than that of the natural\nsubstrate L-kynurenine4 (6 x 105), 600-fold higher than that of 3-bromo-L-kynurenine, and about\ntwice that of 5-chloro-L-kynurenine. Thus, the catalytic efficiency for the bacterial enzyme is\nimproved by introducing a 5-Br or 5-Cl on the aromatic ring of kynurenine, and these\nsubstituents are hugely better than having a 3-Br substituent.\nFor our newly synthesized substrate 5-chloro-L-kynurenine the kcat values are 0.47 sec-1\nand 8.73 sec-1for the human and the bacterial enzyme respectively. Thus, the turnover number\n\n71\n\nfor this substrate with the bacterial enzyme is about 19-fold higher than with the human enzyme.\nFor the human enzyme this kcat of 0.47 sec-1 is about the same as that of 5-bromo-L-kynurenine\nbut about twice that of L-kynurenine and actually 7-fold lower than that of the natural substrate\n3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine5. Thus, having a 5-Cl substituent has a similar effect on the turnover\nnumber as having a 5-Br or a 3-Cl substituent, and this turnover number is higher than when\nhaving a 3-F or a 3-methyl substituent, but all the five compounds are not better than having a 3OH substituent as in the natural substrate. With the bacterial enzyme, the kcat value of 8.73 sec-1\nis about the same as that for 3-F, 3-Br or 5-Br substituent, and about half that of the natural\nsubstrate L-kynurenine4 (16 sec-1), but based on the previous discussion this turnover number is\nbetter than when having a 3-Cl or a 3-methyl substituent. Considering the catalytic efficiency\nwith this substrate we have got kcat/Km values of (1.097 ± 0.12) x 104 and (1.78 ± 0.29) x 106 for\nthe human and the bacterial enzyme, respectively. For the human enzyme, this kcat/Km value of\n(1.10 ± 0.12) x 104 is about 22-fold lower that for the natural substrate 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine5\n(2.46 x 105) but about 24-fold higher than L-kynurenine for the same enzyme.5 Thus, based on\nthis and the previous discussion the catalytic efficiency of the human enzyme with 5-chloro-Lkynurenine is lesser than when having a 3-Cl or a 5-Br substituent but better than when having a\n3-F or a 3-methyl substituent although all five being not as better as having a 3-OH substituent.\nFor the bacterial enzyme the kcat/Km value of (1.78 ± 0.29) x 106 is about 3-fold higher than that\nof the natural substrate L-kynurenine4 (6 x 105), 324-fold higher than that of 3-bromo-Lkynurenine, and about half that of 5-bromo-L-kynurenine. Based on this and the previous\ndiscussion a 5-Br or 5-Cl actually has a positive effect on the catalytic efficiency of the bacterial\nenzyme, but with the exception of 3-F, the other 3-substituents in the group seem to have a\nnegative effect on the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme.\n\n72\n\nTo conclude, these results are useful in drug design. Thus, substituents in the 5-position\nare well tolerated by both enzymes, which is consistent with the X-ray structures5. Furthermore,\na hydroxyl group at 3-position is not absolutely necessary for good activity, as seen for the\nhuman enzyme that the halogens in place of hydroxyl group also work fine.\n\n73\n\nReferences\n\n1.

This is the key step in the catabolism of tryptophan in Pseudomonas fluorescens, and\nsome other bacteria. In eukaryotes a similar enzyme catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of 3hydroxykynurenine to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and L-alanine. Earlier, the mechanism for the\nhydrolytic cleavage of kynurenine has been proposed1. The external aldimine and quinonoid\nintermediate are formed too rapidly within the dead time of the stopped-flow instrument. We\ntherefore synthesized a novel caged kynurenine which would release kynurenine ‘in situ’ thereby\nallowing the detection of formation and decay of the external aldimine intermediate. This chapter\nprovides a detailed synthesis of the caged compound, along with its stability studies.\n\n75\n\nIntroduction\n\nCaged biomolecules have been known for about three decades now2,3 and have become\nincreasingly important by virtue of the light initiated release of the biologically active molecule.\nIn the broader sense, caged compounds are protected photo-labile bioactive substrates that\nrelease the desired substrate upon irradiation with light of a suitable wavelength (> 300 nm).\nSome of the caged compounds include protected phosphates, carboxylates, amines, alcohols, and\nphenols. Caged compounds find extensive application in investigating molecular processes in\nbiochemistry and biophysics. Some bioorganic reactions are too rapid to allow for detection of\nthe intermediate or measure the rate of such reactions. However, by using a caged biomolecule\nthe bioactive substrate can be released ‘in situ’ only when desired by means of a light flash for a\nfew nanoseconds duration. Caged compounds thus allow chemists, biologists, and molecular\nphysiologists to examine the rates of even the fastest biological reactions known. At the same\ntime, light initiated substrate release also gives good insight into the mechanism of enzyme\ncatalyzed biological reactions.\nCaging chromophores need to satisfy several key properties or attributes4. Among these\nare a reasonable absorption in the uv-visible region (> 300nm). This is important as most of the\nenzymes are destroyed at shorter wavelengths. Also, there should be a hypsochromic shift of the\nabsorption spectrum due to the photoproduct so that this absorption does not interfere with the\nabsorptions of any intermediates in the biological processes being studied. It should be easy to\nattach the chromophore to the substrate, and without the introduction of any new stereocenters.\nThe caged compound as well as the photoproduct should be biologically inert, and should also be\ninert or at least benign with respect to other reagents or products. Furthermore, the caged\ncompound should have good aqueous solubility for biological studies. Also, the photochemical\n\n76\n\nrelease must be efficient, and the departure of the substrate from the protecting group should be\nthe primary photochemical process occurring directly from the excited state of the caged\nchromophore. Apart from all these the caging chromophore should preserve the chiral integrity\nof the substrate (i.e. not convert the substrate into a racemate or other enantiomer) during the\nprotection or the photolytic deprotection cycle. Some of the chromophores used for caging\nbioactive substrates include, 2-nitrobenzyl5-10 and 7-nitroindoline11 derivatives, coumarin-4ylmethyl12-19 phototriggers, and the p-hydroxyphenacyl group20-24. Among these the phydroxyphenacyl group is a versatile photoremovable protective group with wide range of\napplications in mechanistic bioorganic chemistry. However, this group can only be used to\nprotect conjugate bases of acids4 such as carboxylic acids, thiols, and phosphates.\nIn the catabolism of tryptophan in Pseudomonas fluorescens, and some other bacteria,\nanthranilic acid and alanine are produced by the hydrolytic cleavage of kynurenine in the\npresence of the enzyme kynureninase. The mechanism of the cleavage has been proved by\nPhillips and Dua1 and proceeds through the initial formation of an external aldimine and\nquinonoid intermediate as shown in Scheme 16. However, the reaction involving the formation\nof these intermediates is too rapid for the rate to be measured, and is over within the dead time of\nthe stopped-flow instrument (ca. 2 milliseconds). Often detection of an intermediate is essential\nin proving the mechanism that an enzyme follows. In our attempt to prepare a caged kynurenine,\nwe hope to release the substrate kynurenine ‘in situ’ which would then undergo the reaction with\nkynureninase thereby allowing us to detect the external aldimine intermediate. Future experiment\nwould involve obtaining a structure of kynureninase “in action” with kynurenine bound in the\nactive site. For this experiment the caged substrate will be soaked into the crystals of either\nhuman or Pseudomonas fluorescens kynureninase, then the reaction initiated by flash photolysis\n\n77\n\nfollowed by rapid cooling in a cold nitrogen stream, and immediate collection of the X-ray\ndiffraction data. Since kynureninase is a drug target enzyme, these structures will be invaluable\nin the design of the next generation of more potent and selective inhibitors of kynureninase.\n\nB\n\nO\n\nCOO\n\nO\n\nCOO\n\nH\nNH\n\nNH3\n\nKynureninase.PLP\nNH2\n\nNH2\n\nKynurenine\n\nHO\nOPO3\n\nExternal aldimine\n(λ\nλmax = 420 nm)\n\nN\nH\n\nO\n\nCOO\nNH\n\nNH2\n\nHO\nOPO3\nN\nH\n\nKynurenine quinonoid intermediate\n(λ\nλmax = 494 nm)\n\nScheme 16\n\n78\n\nExperimental Methods\nGeneral\n1\n\nHNMR and 13CNMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 400MHz instrument in\n\ndeuterated DMSO.

This is followed by an increase of MeOH percentage to 100% with\nthe corresponding decrease of the percentage of 0.1% aq. acetic acid to 0% over 20 – 25 mins.\nAnd finally, a programmed return back of the elution system to 5% MeOH, and 95% of 0.1% aq.\nacetic acid over the period from 25 – 30 mins.

The published procedures25-28 for the\nsynthesis of 2-bromo-4'-hydroxyacetophenone use a variety of reagents like NBS, liquid\nbromine, pyridinium hydrobromide perbromide, and copper (II) bromide, with yields of the\nproduct ranging from 58-94%. We however, have an even more efficient procedure (96%)\nwithout\n\nthe\n\nformation\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nundesirable\n\nside\n\nproducts\n\nviz.\n\nthe\n\n2,2-dibromo-4'-\n\nhydroxyacetophenone compound. The aromatic ring in our method is also less likely to be\nbrominated due the presence of the deactivating acetyl group as well as the fact that the\nbromonium electrophile is weak enough and even more so because we carry out the reaction\n\n82\n\nbelow 25oC. The protocol using CuBr2 in a refluxing mixture of CHCl3/EtOAc4 was especially\ngiving us a mixture of the mono and the dibromo compounds. Using our method the reaction was\ndone conveniently in MeOH at RT using copper (II) bromide as the brominating agent. An SN2\nreaction between the conjugate base of Nα-Boc tryptophan and 2-bromo-4'-hydroxyacetophenone\nin a polar aprotic solvent like DMF is carried out to give the 4-hydroxyphenacyl ester of Nα-Boc\ntryptophan. This ester upon ozonolysis followed by TFA hydrolysis29 produces the desired caged\nkynurenine. The caged compound is isolated by lyophilization as a pale yellow hygroscopic solid\nhydrochloride salt.\nA photo-Favorskii rearrangement has been proposed for the release of the substrates from\ncaged biomolecules30,31. According to the mechanism proposed by Givens et al (Scheme 18)\ninitially the chromophore gets excited to the singlet excited state, followed by a rapid intersystem\ncrossing4 (kST = 2.7 x 1011 s-1) to quantitatively generate the excited triplet state. In the excited\ntriplet state the phenolic group then adiabatically loses a proton to the solvent to give phenoxide\nanion which then releases the substrate in a rate-limiting step, via the intermediacy of the\nspirodienedione. The caged kynurenine has a retention time of about 18 mins. using the above\nmentioned gradient elution system. HPLC analysis shows the compound to be about 99% pure.\nHRMS analysis shows the molecular weight of 342.1294 with the calculated value being\n342.1216.

We have used HPLC analysis to determine the stability of solutions of the caged\ncompound under different conditions. As a solution in dry DMSO it is stable at RT in the dark\nfor a period of about 15 days. As a solution in 10 mM aq. HCl the caged compound is stable for\nabout 3 hours at 20 oC in the dark. However, later on hydrolysis products become apparent and\nafter about 8 hrs. the HPLC shows three peaks corresponding to kynurenine (retention time 6.4\n\n85\n\nmins.), 2,4'-dihydroxyacetophenone (retention time 15 mins., λmax 273 nm), and the caged\ncompound in an approximate ratio of 2:3:5. Based on a similar stability in 1 mM aq. HCl\nsolution, we irradiated a 100μM aq. acidic solution of the caged compound with a Xenon flash\nlamp using a 330 nm filter to check if the photocleavage is initiated. However, HPLC analysis\nshowed no cleavage of the cage.\nThe caged compound is found to be extremely unstable in pH 8 phosphate and TEA\nbuffers and gets almost completely hydrolyzed in about 15 mins. The half life for the caged\ncompound in these buffer systems was 3.75 mins. and 4.65 mins. respectively. We were\nexpecting the stability of the caged compound and hence its half life to grow 10-fold in going\nfrom pH 8 to pH 7 and 100-fold in going from pH 8 to pH 6. However, the half life of the caged\ncompound in pH 7 and pH 6 phosphate buffer was found to be 9.75 mins. and 17.1mins.\nrespectively. Thus, the stability did not raise considerably in going from pH 8 to pH 6 buffer\nsystem. Nevertheless, the caged compound is stable for up to 3 hrs. in a 1 mM aq. HCl (pH 3)\nsolution. We then checked the stability of the caged compound in pH 7 Tris buffer containing 55\nmM MgCl2 and 25% w/v polyethylene glycol (PEG), the solution used for crystallization of\nhuman kynureninase. We have found that the caged compound is fairly stable in this buffer\nsystem for about 30 mins. but later on hydrolysis products are seen in the HPLC analysis. Based\non this stability we irradiated a 200μM solution of the caged compound with one hundred 1ns\nlaser pulses and found by HPLC that the cage has been removed completely. In future\nexperiments this would be the buffer system of choice to study the reaction involving the release\nof kynurenine in situ. We were however not able to perform the experiment due to instrumental\nproblems wherein the enzyme fluorescence skewed the observance of the desired intermediates.\n\n86\n\nReferences\n1.\n\nDua, R.

We synthesized the 3-chloro-DLkynurenine, 3-fluoro-DL-kynurenine, 3-methyl-DL-kynurenine, 5-bromo-L-kynurenine, and 5chloro-L-kynurenine and compared the turnover number as well as the catalytic efficiency of\neach of these substrates as compared to L-kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine for both the\nhuman and the bacterial enzyme. Thus, for the human enzyme a comparison of the turnover\nnumber for each of these substrates with the natural substrate 3-hydroxykynurenine, shows that\nall of them have a lower turnover number than the natural substrate and the turnover number\ndecreases in the order: 3-OH > 3-Cl > 5-Br > 5-Cl > 3-Me > 3-F. And for the human enzyme a\ncomparison of the turnover number for each of these substrates with L-kynurenine shows the\nturnover number to decrease in the order: 5-Br = 3-Cl > 5-Cl > 3-F = 3-Me = L-kynurenine.\nThus, for the human enzyme having a substituent on the aromatic ring of kynurenine increases\nthe turnover number but not as much as that of the 3-OH substituent. For the bacterial enzyme a\ncomparison of the turnover number for each of these substrates with the natural substrate Lkynurenine the turnover number decreases in the order: L-kynurenine = 3-Br = 5-Br > 3-F = 5-Cl\n> 3-Me > 3-Cl. Thus, the turnover number with the bacterial enzyme seems to be unaffected by\nthe presence of a larger substituent but other substituents have a reduced turnover number than\nthe natural substrate. From the foregoing discussion it can be concluded that while the bacterial\nenzyme seems to be bothered by the presence of a substituent other than 3-Br or 5-Br, the human\nenzyme on the other hand prefers to have a substituent on the aromatic ring, as seen by an\nimproved turnover number than when there is no substituent (L-kynurenine).\n\n90\n\nFor the human enzyme a comparison of the catalytic efficiency for each of these\nsubstrates with the natural substrate 3-hydroxykynurenine, shows that the catalytic efficiency is\nmuch lower than that for the natural substrate and it decreases in the order: 3-OH > 3-Cl = 5-Br >\n5-Cl > 3-F > 3-Me. Thus, for the human enzyme having a substituent other than –OH seems to\nactually reduce the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for that substrate as compared to the\nnatural substrate. For the human enzyme a comparison of the catalytic efficiency for each of\nthese substrates with L-kynurenine shows the decreasing order to be: 5-Br = 3-Cl > 5-Cl > 3-F >\n3-Me > L-kynurenine. Thus, for the human enzyme having a substituent on the aromatic ring\nactually increases the catalytic efficiency than when there is no substituent (L-kynurenine) but\nthis improvement in catalytic efficiency is not better than having a 3-OH substituent as in the\nnatural substrate, presumably because these other groups are not capable of H-bonding like –OH,\nwhich has been recently proved from the crystal structure of the enzyme (Lima. S. et al 2009).\nFor the bacterial enzyme a comparison of the catalytic efficiency for each of these substrates\nwith the natural substrate L-kynurenine shows the decreasing order to be: 5-Br > 5-Cl > Lkynurenine ~ 3-F > 3-Me > 3-Cl > 3-Br. Thus, the catalytic efficiency of the bacterial enzyme is\nactually better than the natural substrate when there is a 5-Br or a 5-Cl substituent, but the\ncatalytic efficiency is lowered by the other substituents. And from the foregoing discussion it can\nbe concluded that while the catalytic efficiency of the bacterial enzyme seems to be bothered by\nthe presence of a substituent other than 5-Br or 5-Cl, the human enzyme on the other hand\nactually prefers to have a substituent on the aromatic ring, as seen by an improved catalytic\nefficiency than when there is no substituent (L-kynurenine).\nAlso, to conclude we have synthesized a novel caged kynurenine which in future will be\nused for the generation of kynurenine ‘in situ’ by a flash photolysis thereby allowing the\n\n91\n\ndetection of formation and decay of the external aldimine intermediate in the reaction of\nkynureninase. This detection will further prove the mechanism of action followed by the enzyme\nkynureninase.\n\n92\n\nAPPENDIX\n\n93\n\nScanning kinetic spectrum for 3-chloro-DL-kynurenine\n\n2.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\n0.6\n\n0.1\n220\n-0.4\n\n270\n\n320\n\n370\n\n420\n\n94\n\nScanning kinetic spectrum for 3-fluoro-DL-kynurenine\n\n2.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\n0.6\n\n0.1\n220\n-0.4\n\n270\n\n320\n\n370\n\n420\n\n95\n\nScanning kinetic spectrum for 33-methyl-DL-kynurenine\n\n96\n\nScanning kinetic spectrum for 5-chloro-L-kynurenine\n\n2.1\n\n1.6\n\n1.1\n\n0.6\n\n0.1\n220\n-0.4\n\n270\n\n320\n\n370\n\n420\n\n97\n\nRate kinetics data for 3-chloro-DL-kynurenine with human enzyme\nSr.\nNo.\n\n2mM\nPLP\n( μL)\n\n1M\npH8\nKPi\n\n3mM 3Cl-DLKYNU\n\n( μL)\n\n( μL)\n\nEnzyme\nSolution\n( μL)\n\nIonized\nwater\n( μL)\n\nFinal\nconcn.\nof 3-ClDLKYNU\n\nFinal\nVol. of\nassay\nsoln.\n\nRate set\n1\n\nRate set\n2\n\n( μL)\n\n( μM)\n1\n\n12\n\n18\n\n4\n\n50\n\n516\n\n20\n\n600\n\n-0.0026\n\n-0.0027\n\n2\n\n12\n\n18\n\n8\n\n50\n\n512\n\n40\n\n600\n\n-0.0048\n\n-0.0054\n\n3\n\n12\n\n18\n\n16\n\n50\n\n504\n\n80\n\n600\n\n-0.0100\n\n-0.0092\n\n4\n\n12\n\n18\n\n32\n\n50\n\n488\n\n160\n\n600\n\n-0.0117\n\n-0.0139\n\n5\n\n12\n\n18\n\n64\n\n50\n\n456\n\n320\n\n600\n\n-0.0123\n\n-0.0146\n\nNotes:\n\n1.
