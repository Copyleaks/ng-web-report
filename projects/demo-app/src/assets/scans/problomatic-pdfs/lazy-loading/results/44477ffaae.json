Its central iconic presence in art and architectural theory has brought\nformalism its quasi-religious status amongst designers as authors-of-form. The current expressionist crisis\nof formalism within the praxis of digital design however, conceals a deep vein of complexity and\ncontradiction between form and formation in contemporary discourse. Form’s obituary is rapidly being\noutlined as second generation baby-boomers chart out territories for a formal atheism, or, if I am not\npromoting too lofty a claim, a new religion. It is called, The New Materiality.\n\nIs architectural design culture ready to abandon the dinosaur sanctuary of formal expression? In order to\ndefine, defend and deliver argumentation for a design process driven by something other than form, I\nhave chosen to override entirely the stylistic content of form as defined by the 19th century German\ntheoreticians that influenced the historians and canonical interpreters of modernism, Nicholas Pevsner and\nSiegfried Gideon. Such dismissiveness is indeed a principled one and necessary in order to formulate a\nnon-biased account from the point of view of historical contingency. In other words: it is impossible to\nliberate oneself from the historical logic of the emergence of formalism as design ideology without first\ncanceling it out by way of revisiting a completely new set of historical resources in order to promote the\nappearance of an alternative rationale. A populist argumentation of that genre has only brought about\nmore thoughts of form in its many manifestations and there is now an urgent need to rearrange road maps\nof alternative historical precedents in order to articulate form’s other and to resurrect some of nature’s\nwell kept secrets. Ecce Forma!\n\n1\n\nThe Weave of Formalist Discourse: Form's Other\nWoven into architectural discourse is a warp of the positive with its interwoven counter-form, the weft of\nthe negative and prohibited. This interrelationship of the dominant positive and its forbidden dual is also\nthe nature of ideological rhetoric. Bred into the revolutionary polemics of Modernism and into the weave\nof its evolutionary discourse is a dominance of the visual and formal attended by the subdued other: the\nmaterial, the productive, and the tactile. Through a looking glass we see the other while its form appears\nfaintly as a subtle reflection. That act of piercing the logic of the image in reflection, of seeing through the\nlooking glass, is an act that identifies material's radicals, Otto, Hauser, Isler, or Prouvé, each having\nproffered a tentative foray towards a new logic of making.\n\nThe new materialism in architecture that has emerged as a phenomenon of late Postmodernism appears to\nbe a sign of cultural stirring. With the assistance of advanced Material Sciences and a body of remarkable\ninternational structural engineers, architectural culture appears poised for transformation. But, in the short\nrun, crossing the conceptual boundaries of the culture of praxis is not possible merely as a countercultural effort, an act of the trans-valuation of values. Thus the contemporary culture of geometrically\ncomplex surfaces, the dramatic level of interest in emerging materials and the appearance of paradoxical\nmorphologies (e.g. the bird's nest, or the voronoi-based water cube) may be ironically interpreted as the\nsmooth evolution of formal complexity from semantic, to geometric, to informed morphological\nexpressionism. Will the real new paradigm please stand up?!\n\nSince the middle of the 1990’s, various architects and architectural historians have been attempting to\ntheorize the emergence of a new paradigm. This period of re-theorizing architecture has been accompanied\nby realized work both in the form of few canonic built works, experimental architecture that has remained\nin project form, and the production of theoretical texts. It is as yet difficult to clearly determine the nature of\nthis new paradigm in architecture, its generality and relevance, as well as its theoretical foundations.\n\nIf there is a cultural turn, than its vague parameters define a blurred outline still qualified by dallying with\nthe culture of style and stardom. One senses the exhaustion of formalist modernism, its myopic narcissism\nfaced with challenges of credibility, accountability, professionalism and ecological neglect. My objective\nis to trace certain of the characteristics of what I have termed a cultural turn, in order to identify the\nevolutionary, as well as revolutionary, nature of the dynamics of new and emerging architectural\ndiscourse. This discourse projects us very rapidly beyond the point of a dialectics of formalism through a\nnew materialism and, beyond this, towards the indications in experimental approaches that we are in the\n\n2\n\nearly stages of movement towards a new architecture. It is the tracing of the evolution of this theoretical\ndiscourse, beyond a dialectics of late postmodernism and the mapping of its new taxonomy and concepts\nthat is the objective of my work here. Along the way, we will encounter and joust with the shibboleths of\na transitional period. With some luck, we will emerge on the other side of the mirror.\n\nFrom Myopic Seers to Slippery Paradigms\nIn undertaking such a work, a work that proposes that an imminent paradigm shift can be characterized\nthrough an analysis of the critical discourse, it seems important to consider in the beginning certain of the\nlogical pitfalls and impediments that may lie in waiting.\n\nWhat classes of fallacy might be encountered in such a work? The first might be referred to as the “myopic\nseer”. Basically, it refers to the problem of conceptualizing change within an existing semiotic framework\nand while attempting to justify the continuing intellectual validity of a prior position. A classic example\nmay be found in Zevi’s, Modern Language of Architecture and in late thoughts which he propagated\nthrough his magazine L'Architettura, Cronache e Storia. Developed in books and articles, Zevi presented a\ntheory of the new paradigm in architecture as continuing and expanding his interpretation of Modernism.\n\nWhile strongly attributing the background of these cultural developments to the emergence and application\nof anti-rules corresponding to the language of architecture created by the great modernists Le Corbusier,\nGropius, Mies van der Rohe, and Wright – Zevi makes a case for “both continuity and change”. However\nthe dominant ideological underpinning of the thesis is that the new developments are committed to\npluralism – that is, he returns to certain of the fundamental characteristics of Zevian post-modernism. The\nnew complexity is thus distinguished by scale, or composition, rather than by substantive difference.\n\nAside from drafting an alternative system of architectural representation characterized by a free\ninterpretation of function, an emphasis on dissonance, a dynamic of multidimensional vision, and\nindependent interplay of elements, much of the conceptual framework repeats certain of the commitments\nto old friends and to familiar ideas. The most problematic of these tendencies is to frame his arguments in\nthe language of formal analysis. The formal description and the exegesis of building form emphasizing a\nless restrained interpretation of form - follows in place of the more classical Beaux Art language with its\nfocus on abstract principles of order, proportion, and symmetry - and repeats the emphasis upon the primacy\nof formal content as an indicator of deep cultural developments that came to characterize his writing. Thus\nthe attempt to interpret epochal change while still maintaining the essentially modernist logic of the primacy\n\n3\n\nand self-awareness of formal content appears to be one form of fallacy to be circumvented. Perhaps such\nproblems can be avoided by adopting a different method of analysis, and one much less dependent upon the\nactual formal analysis of buildings and projects.\n\nIn other words: Zevi promoted an organic marriage of engineering and design, and an integration of\nbuildings into their surroundings, without disrupting the plethora of formalist values, relating to\ncomposition and representation, so inherent in the Modernist tradition. Moreover, anticipating the language\nof postmodern architecture, Zevi argues forcefully for complexity and against unity by means of the very\nsame elements of the modern language of architecture identified throughout history, to discuss the process\nof architectural innovation. Zevi's critique was indeed uncompromising of any tendency in modern\narchitecture towards classicism. However, such criticism was fueled by an anti-language that employed the\nvery same formal indicators. This is almost as bad as breaking a taboo by giving it political legitimacy\n(rather than offering an alternative ideology). Ironically, Zevi will be remembered as the ultimate iconoclast\nand deconstructive prophet of formal fragmentation.\n\nThis appears to be part of a conceptual and taxonomic problem (lacking a new conceptual structure), and of\na semiotic problem (re-using formal concepts). The method of discourse analysis, as compared to a process\nbased upon formal analysis may help to overcome this problem. In addition, the mapping of concepts\nappears in itself to be of some potential value.\n\nForgiving Zevi, Forgetting Rowe:\nThe Rejection of the Formal Organic\nOne of the predominant indicators of cultural shifts is the effort to replace the root sources of the logic of\nthe period. Beyond Zevi’s significant work and in the case of recent design practice, amongst dominant\ntheoretical underpinnings has been the writing of Colin Rowe. Whether or not there was a direct influence\nthat might be attributed to certain now canonic writings such as The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa, (1947),\nTransparency, (1963) and Collage City, (1978) is not the point here; the basic ideas of these writings deeply\npermeated design culture of the last decades and can legitimately be seen as theoretical explanations, if not\nas causes, for important design phenomena. These phenomena are now undergoing a profound process of\nreconsideration and critique as a new generation of designers and theoreticians distances itself intellectually\nand methodologically from the values and practices of formalism. It is here that Rowe’s influence is being\nevaluated and reinterpreted as part of the process of cultural transformation in architectural thinking.\n\n4\n\nContrary to Rowe, but not without passionate support for the Modernist movement, Zevi opposed the\nattribution of the Modernist project to International Architecture claiming against its re-reading with tools\nof the Classic language. Zevi rejected Rowe’s formalism, claiming his was a rigid framework rooted in\nfunctionalism and composition - both divorced from context. Zevi’s notion of the Organic was meant to\nbring closer the disciplines of design and engineering in the development of spaces integrated into their\nsurroundings. However, Zevi’s Organicism carried yet another dialect of and from the formalist project in\nsuggesting its erosion and reformulation as organic – that is to say - contextual.\n\nContrasting Rowe and Zevi appears somewhat provocative particularly as they both represented\nsignificantly different approaches to form and formal generation. However, both of them, in their own way,\ntreated form as the container of matter – whether structural or contextual - rather than the other way around.\n\nForm, Formal, Formalist:\nInformation, Informative, Informed\nForm relates to the physical properties of objects including shape and order, or gestalt. As a concept it\ncontains an inherent ambiguity as pointed out by Forty: “There is in ‘form’ an inherent ambiguity between\nits meaning ‘shape’ on the one hand, and on the other ‘idea’ or ‘essence’: one describes the property of\nthings as they are known to the senses, the other as they are known to the mind” (Forty, 2000, p.149). It is\nthis duality of meanings that explains what has been described as the “formal project” of Colin Rowe.\nAmong other things, this series of writings proposed a particular method for the analysis of architectural\nform and the beginning of a set of taxonomic categories for form in architecture. The types of categories\nthat Rowe used were reductive in the sense that they were purely formal and ideational. That is, they\neliminated other considerations from the totality of the factors of relevance to architecture such as material,\nstructure, socio-cultural aspects, and contingent factors related to site, specific program, etc. They were\nideational in the sense that they established an abstract conceptual order – the mathematics – that was\nintended to support his concept of ideal types as schema. Greg Lynn refers to this aspect of Rowe’s early\nwriting (including Mathematics and Transparency) as his formal-analytical phase (Lynn, 1993). In fact, one\nof the impacts of this work was to institutionalize the taxonomic aspect of formal analyses.\n\nFormal, or formalist, indicates the emphasis upon form with the connotation of some means of rigorous\nrepresentational description, or formalization. In this sense the term subsumes both the systemics of the\n\n5\n\nformal content as well as the method of generation through formal representation. As a pejorative term, it\nusually connotes the excessive reliance upon formal content and the resultant reductive effect. Lynn argues\nthat Rowe’s ideal and trans-historical formalism places emphasis on proportional systems, or particular\nplan, and other relationships, as the formal ordering system. As has been pointed out, this designation of\nformal categories served to encourage the development by others of formal taxonomic systems.\n\nThere was another meaning of the term formal that has had a broad impact on architectural design culture.\nRowe never went so far as to propose a syntax of design, or a method of syntactic design. This was left to\nothers, among them the “White Architects”, of “the New York Five”. What is implied in the phrase\nsyntactic design is that a formal taxonomy can be developed into a formal, or syntactic, order that can then\nbecome the basis of a design method. The important distinction of this definition is that a formal system can\nbecome the basis for design generation. In this sense the particularities of the formal result are less\nsignificant than the fact that formal generation is based upon a formal vocabulary, the a priori\nrepresentational definition of which is the source of the design method. That is precisely how formal\ntaxonomies became an instrumental and operative medium. Bear these arguments in mind later vis a vis\ndigital approaches with their continuity of formal models despite their transposition of computational\nmethods and models.\n\nModern post-war formalism permeated world design culture. The exploitation of formal languages as\ngenerators of architectural form became a dominant characteristic of architecture since the 1970’s. This is a\nbroad generalization that attempts to subsume such tendencies as early examples of “syntactic design” later\ncollage-motivated design, and “deconstructivist” works all within the formalist project. Regardless of the\ndisparity of appearance of the works of diverse architects, the common denominator is the predominance of\nformal content and the exploitation of this content as the basis for design generation.\n\nThe Critique and Reinterpretation of Formalism\nOne of the great revolutions of Modern Art, that of conceptual art, or art as a form of critical self\nawareness, played an important role in the architecture and theory of recent decades. Conceptual\narchitecture was the subject of a special issue of the Harvard Design Magazine (Number 19, Fall 2003Winter 2004) entitled Architecture as Conceptual Art? The opening article by Eric Lum is an attack of the\nconceptualist (here read, formalist) position in architecture on the basis of its reductive qualities and its\ninappropriateness to the practice of architecture. The sculptor Sol Lewitt’s statement, “the idea becomes a\nmachine that makes the art”, and the shift in emphasis upon process art were among the classes of ideas and\n\n6\n\npractices that influenced the New York Five and thus contributed to the crystallization of an American new\nformalism. Lum presents a strong case for the intellectual and aesthetic failure of the formalist project due\nto an inability to successfully deal with the conflict between conceptualism and the intrinsic materiality of\narchitecture. In fact, the abandonment of the material and the tectonic by certain formalists is proposed as a\nform of artistic, as well as professional, loss of competence. The discrepancy between project\nconception/visualization and project realization is proposed as endemic to the formalist practice of design in\nwhich conceptual realization is so strongly identified with the ideological content and material realization is\ntypically separated from the generative process. This schizophrenia of formalism, that radically separates\nconceptual content from material reality may be one of the greatest forces for a shift of paradigm. Lum\npresents the case for the existence of a conceptually rich architecture that is tectonically and materially\nmotivated. However the point that hard-line conceptualism is more than an aesthetic position, it is a design\nmethod that is demonstrating its’ severe limitations, has been made.\n\nThere are other critical positions that are less oppositional and attempt to identify certain of the root\nproblems of formalism in order to suggest a resolution. Sanford Kwinter’s paper, “Who’s Afraid of\nFormalism?”, first made an important semantic distinction: “The form problem, from the time of the preSocratics to the late 20th Century is, in fact, an almost unbroken concern with the mechanisms of formation,\nthe process by which discernable patterns come to dissociate themselves from a less finely ordered\nfield...What I call true formalism refers to any method that diagrams the proliferation of fundamental\nresonances and demonstrates how these accumulate into figures of order and shape” (Kwinter, 2000).\n\nHere Kwinter while accepting formation as the raison d’être of a formal approach, skirts and cleverly\nbypasses some of the deleterious process and effects of formalism. Kwinter goes on to introduce certain\nimportant points that reconsider form from what might be considered a contemporary scientific point of\nview and one that is significant to emerging methods of thought and procedure in design. He proposes that\nresultant form, the results of formative processes, come about through the interaction of “internal rules and\nexternal (morphogenic) pressures...” If we assume that his internal rules are inherent in the materials of the\nproblem of design and that morphogenic pressures are the contingent aspects of the ecology of site and\nprogram, then his position moves the concept of form into a much more contemporary position.\n\nHe then makes two additional contributions to the reformulation of the idea of the formal: he introduces the\ncontemporary relevance of a discussion of Goethe’s morphology, and in so doing, introduces a view of\nmorphogenesis as an intricate procedural mechanism. “Goethe’s formalism, like all rigorous and interesting\n\n7\n\nones, actually marks a turning away from the simple structure of end products towards the active, everchanging processes that bring them into being.\" (Kwinter, 2000).\n\nGreg Lynn, in his article, “New Variations on the Rowe Complex” (Lynn, 1993), attempts to make certain\nof these concepts of the procedural more explicit in their requirement of a new mathematics. “What is\nnecessary for a rigorous theorization of diversity and difference within the discipline of architecture is\nprecisely an alternative mathematics of form: a formalism that is not reducible to ideal villas or other fixed\ntypes, but is in its essence freely differentiated\" (Lynn, 1993). Lynn introduces the Origins of Geometry of\nHusserl of 1936 in order to further specify the qualities of such a new mathematics. In the place of eidetic or\npure geometric forms, Lynn proposes a mathematics of form based upon “anexact yet rigorous protogeometries (variations)” (Lynn, 1993). Here Lynn, too, in his reinterpretation of form beyond Rowe also\nbrings us relatively up to date regarding some of the scientific foundations relating to formal generation.\n“An alternative mathematics of form that is both irreducible yet precise, and anexact yet rigorous would\nresist transcendent and universal ideological proclamations precisely because they cannot be idealized and\nreproduced identically...Where Rowe’s logic is extensive, exact and reducible, an alternative mathematics\nof form would be emergent, indeterminate, differential, intensive, anexact, and creative.” (Lynn,1993).\n\nWho's Afraid of Performance?\nFrom the early writings of modern theoreticians such as Giedeon, theories of form have dominated the\ndiscourse of architectural modernism. Arguments for a new formalism appeared in the early Nineties in\nthe guise of towards yet another new architecture: Kipnis’ brilliant essay is one such example (Kipnis,\n1993). Other theoreticians began an exegesis on the phenomena of formalism (Kwinter, 2000) and its\nsignificance as a general model of thought and design. Kwinter is a threshold figure in this discourse,\nsince he is among the few architectural theoreticians that attempt to bridge the territory between\narchitecture and modernism's traditional partnership relationship with emerging technology (Kwinter,\n2003).\n\nAmong the historical sources of this new discourse were the morphological studies of Goethe. Goethe is\nsaid to have rejected the Kantian-Newtonian model of form and to have proposed the first modern genetic\ntheory of form. In his theory, formation and formative processes were more significant than appearance,\nand in his botanical studies he created formalisms for generation and evolution. Among contemporary\nbiological theories of relevance to an architectural theory of emergence are some references in which\ngeneral theoretical considerations such as adaptation, evolution and variation within species are introduced\n\n8\n\nand theoretical issues and problems are presented. Biological models of evolution and emergence\ntransfigure the concepts and issues of morphogenesis and stimulate the development of new procedural\napproaches to the solution of design problems. Thus various theories of morphogenesis and evolution such\nas Catastrophe Theory (Thom) and Emergence (Holland) dealing in general with problems of emergence\nand the behavior of complex systems are proving to be relevant to the development of new architectural\ntheories and design methods. This is particularly the case, if architectural systems are considered complex,\ndynamic systems intended to produce variation and heterogeneity in the solution of designs rather than the\nappearance of a static formal object as the instantiation of a particular style.\n\nFormation without formalism is promoting new ways of thinking about form and its generation. Shifting\nantithetically from the formalist avant-garde of the current generation, this new conception appears to\nmove architecture and architectural theory to a consolidation of design theory, emerging technologies,\nand new computational thinking. Concepts such as parametric design and performance-based design are\nnow moving practice to a more materials, construction and environmental sensitivity. While shifting away\nfrom formalist theories and methods, such model of thinking about form is enabling designers to achieve\nnew levels of innovation and creativity. The remarkable aspect of such a new per formative paradigm is\nthat it is (or seeks to be) generative of unique solutions without dependence on existing formal techniques\nof form generation. Among the most promising aspects of recent development in design methodology\nrelated to this discourse has been the move to increase the viability of a research-related design process.\nThe notion of architectural precedent knowledge in the form of building types is being reconsidered as the\nstatic conception of types loses relevance in contemporary architecture and urbanism. This research and\nexperimental orientation is making multivalent, environmentally sensitive approaches possible and\nproductive in actual design. The new paradigm has also elevated computational practice to the level of\ndesign thinking as digital design has become the theoretical hard-core of architectural theory. In doing so\nit has distanced computational interventions from categories of form and the boredom of technological\nexpressionism.\n\nThe Recurrence and Vitality of Organic Fallacies\nA thread of critique against the dominance of visual and formalist values and their oppositions in Modern\nArchitecture is frequently proposed as an \"alternative tradition\" (Wilson, 2007) or as a \"natural\" or\n\"organic\" architecture (Gans and Kuz, 2003; Pearson, 2001). Early historians such as Zevi frequently\npromoted the organic fallaciously within the framework of formal indicators. Being at times both critical\nand proactive, arguments for the organic are thus an important alternative thread of the critical discourse\n\n9\n\nof modernism. The organic is also part of a contemporary interest in the study and modeling of natural\ndevelopmental processes as models of design principles in nature generally associated with biomimetics\n(Jeronimidis, 2004).\n\nThe evolution of the organicist discourse from ideological positions of \"natural architecture\" to the more\npromising appropriation of new sciences within the epistemology of architectural knowledge is as eclectic\nand miscellaneous as its many interpretations. As a philosophy, and per its original designation, it is said\nto promote harmony between human habitation and the natural environment through the integration of a\nbuilding into its site. Gaudi, Wright, Sullivan and Zevi have all blueprinted these ideas by implementing\nformal vocabularies and ordering principles. Wright, whose retrospective is currently displayed at the\nGuggenheim Museum, was said to have extended the term to include natural design processes sensitive to\nnature's special use of materials. Wright spoke of the building as a “unified organism” through which\ngeometrical operations are composed around a central theme. However, here again was a process of\nexplanation rather than germination, an analogy which has occurred in the form of the building after its\nauthorship has been strongly determined by its formal system..\n\n\"So here I stand before you preaching organic architecture: declaring organic architecture to be the\nmodern ideal and the teaching so much needed if we are to see the whole of life, and to now serve the\nwhole of life, holding no traditions essential to the great TRADITION. Nor cherishing any preconceived\nform fixing upon us either past, present or future, but instead exalting the simple laws of common sense\nor of super-sense if you prefer determining form by way of the nature of materials...\" - Frank Lloyd\nWright, An Organic Architecture, 1939\n\nOther modernist architects, held complementary and often contending views regarding architecture’s\nrelation to nature and how best to emulate it. Post-war European modernists attempted to promote\ncybernetic and information models of life, as is also related to certain of the later works of Bucky Fuller.\n\nAlong with other noble theoretical legacies, these great players of twentieth century modernism have,\nunconsciously cultivated organic fallacies that have become defined by their formal language. Such\norganic fallacies resulted in an appropriation of nature and the organic as prescribed metaphor. However,\nwhen extended to include its literal attributions, and the stuff that nature is made of, one may approach an\nalternative paradigm of design rather than its visual language. Thus materiality becomes an a priori\ncondition of design rather than its set of a posteriori effects.\n\n10\n\nThe New Materialism and Its Problematics\nKwinter has referred to \"material as the new space\", and the breadth of interest and activity around new\nand innovative materials and material technologies is one of the dominant influences upon architectural\ndesign today and its associated research activities and industrial collaborations. So prominent is the drive\nfor material innovation that it has been broadly absorbed into architectural design and into the research\norientation of mainstream practice (Balmond, 2006; Addington and Schodek, 2004) as well as into\nacademic research (Mori, 2002). This new materialism appears to be of diverse and complex influences\nupon contemporary design. On the one hand it has been quickly absorbed as a stylistic and formal\nphenomenon (Garcia, 2006) while its more profound and complex interrelations to science, technology\nand design are only now emerging (Antonelli, 2008).\n\nMatter over Shape over Matter\nTo paraphrase Darwin: there is more to the origin of form than the preservation of favorite expressions in\nthe struggle for style. Ours is a new kind of struggle and a New Materiality begins where Formalism ends,\nliterally. By way of good practice we are educated to apply matter to any given shape. This assumes the\npredominance of shape over matter in processes of form-generation and the natural emphasis on the form\nof things. However, when inverted, we find that starting with matter is not as straightforward a process as\nwe might anticipate. Shape, it appears, (still) rules over matter.\n\nPlato distinguishes between two classes of form which are indeed centrally iconic but not widely\nunderstood; one relates to the outward appearance of an object, and the other – to the technical virtues\ninherent in it. The latter relates to “the form of an idea”, “the form of knowledge” or “a form of thinking”.\nThese two concepts are interrelated in that, according to Plato, the appearance or shape of an object\nfollows the form or the logic of its creation. Indeed, the more accepted definition – as coined by the\nGreeks – relates the notion of form, or shape, to vision and appearance. Thales, amongst other preSocratic philosophers, introduced the notion of substance to include the differences of shape over time\nand to indicate that forms are temporary contraptions of objects placed in their contexts be they material\nor immaterial. Socrates coined the term Hylomorphism which identifies substance as the culmination of\nmatter and form. Interestingly, while “form” was treated by the Greeks as a singularity which caused\nplural representations of itself in particular objects, “matter” was considered particular in its own right\nrather than a secondary attribute of form. In a sense, “matter” was treated as a singularity without\nrepresentation. From this, the world of forms removed from matter is a representational one, where\n\n11\n\nphysical manifestation is captured as curatorial judgment to represent reality. It is clear that the fluency\nwith which to unpack form’s native designation requires some disambiguation. Such a noble cause\ndepends on the historical context as much as it adheres to one interpretation or the other. But, clearly, the\nmission of parsing through the many forms of attending form is overwhelming in its conceptual and\nchronological scales.\n\nArchitecturally speaking, when we think of “form” we think of the shape of a thing and how it might be\ndescribed in terms of its geometry. For thousands of years, the largest structures on earth were the\npyramids, but rarely does one refer to the distribution of load when describing the shape of a monumental\ntetrahedron. The nature of this claim remains consistent across the periods from ancient Egypt to Bilbao.\nForm is a category of description as opposed to a causal condition as it might be described in nature.\n\nThe Miasmic Rhetoric of Digital Architecture\nThe three sources of the emerging material paradigm in architecture are the new sciences (particularly the\ngrowing relevance of the organic precedents in the life sciences and the sciences of complexity); the\ndiverse phenomena of the emerging new materiality; and the growing importance of digital technologies\nand design media in architecture. Beyond the growing pains of a surge of interest in computational\ngeometry and its potential (Lynn, 1999; Lynn. 2008; Pottmann, et alia, 2007) for the creation of a new\narchitecture, the digital in architecture has truly radical potential for rethinking architectural thought and\nprocedure. The digital may be more of an epistemological revolution than a new architecture.\nTranscending the rhetoric of \"digital architecture\" appears to be a necessary purgative in order to get\nbeyond the more superficial phenomena of the digital to its transformative role in thinking a new design.\nHow can we become digitally transcendental?\n\nForm Forbidden:\nThe Art and Artifice of Digital Materiality\nThe consolidation of relevant scientific precedents, the new materialism, and the potential of the digital as\na medium of design environments has created the conditions for an architecture of artificial (designed)\nmaterialities. It is the computational role of creating an approach to a mediated materialism in architecture\nthat is the subject of my research. The remainder of the article presents the theory, methods and\nachievements of this body of work as well as its implication for ecological impact. The new materiality as\n\n12\n\nan epistemology of design potentially presents a radical alternative to the formalist method so deeply\ningrained in modernist design culture.\n\nContrary to the modernist design approach which promoted divisions of function implicit in the\narchitectural elements (structure, façade, etc), design based upon performance and conditions of\nhabitation postulates divisions of effect (structural, environmental, etc.) Our ability to quantify a\nbuilding’s structural and environmental performance assumes that differences of use and behavior must\nbe accommodated for. Given such ability to predict and respond to performance criteria and desired\neffects, the new materialism aims at shifting practice to a condition of performance-based programming\nand material design. Design based upon material performance seeks to promote an approach whereby\nmatter is distributed where needed responding to its structural, environmental or, indeed, social\nperformance. In fostering material integration across various scales, architectural elements such as\nstructure and façade are no longer divorced in function and/or behavior, but rather negotiated through the\ninformed distribution of matter.\n\nOne significant consequence of design that is informed by performance is the incorporation of difference:\ngradients of structural and material effects emerge modulating their thickness, transparency, porosity and\nthermal absorption according to their assigned function or desired condition of stability (structure) and\ninhabitation (program). It is the approach to material computation which enables direct design in artificial,\nor designed, materials (Oxman, 2009). We discuss the concept of difference in terms of its implications\non the built environment. Difference, describes a condition of non-homogenous organization where the\nheterogeneous organization of elements or materials acts as one medium to enable performance-based\ndesign.\n\nWithin those processes of computational design directly associated with materials, it is the computational\npotential for the control and variation of material structure (structurally, spatially and materially) that has\nbeen an objective of my work.\n\nWhat is Material Computation?\nThe objective of Material Computation is the formalization of the generative processes of the design of\nmateriality, or the complex properties of material systems. Prominent among the properties of compound\nmateriality is that of heterogeneity, or structural/organizational variation. The computational production\nof heterogeneous materiality, in turn, produces material attributes that have important implications for the\n\n13\n\nefficiency of material behavior through design, and thus on characteristics such as contributions to\nsustainability.\n\nThe design objective of Material Computation is thus to establish integration between material properties\nand environmental performance requirements within form-generation processes. It is intended that this\nclass of computational environments will be relevant to all fields of design, including product and\nbuilding design, in which materiality is particularly significant across a range of scales. The theoretical\nfoundations and experimental work in generating and evaluating the computational environment has been\nundertaken in the design fields of architecture and industrial design (Oxman, 2007, 2008).\n\nMaterial Computation is an integrated series of computational processes that enable parametric variation\nof material properties and behavior as informed by the environment. This method has broad implications\nfor the design process as well as for the uniquely adaptive character of the product of design. Currently\nsuch performative technologies are primarily analytical rather than synthetic (generative). However given\nthe possibility to formulate and formalize classes of material systems, it is possible to conceive of\nsimulation models that directly integrate performance simulation with design generation. Such an\nintegrated approach would support performance-based design. I have merely sketched the outlines and\nobjectives of the theory of Material Computation and the series of computational design methods that I\nhave developed through experimental research accomplished over the past years. My objective here has\nbeen to present this work as a part of an intellectual transition to a new materiality that may be an antidote\nto formalism as a general paradigm of design.\n\nEcce Forma: Welcome the New Materiality\nThis is to be read as an epilogue for formalism and as the first shot fired for a prolegomenon of the new\nmateriality. Defined by arbitrary stipulation or taken seriously: new ways of form-making require that we\nmove beyond the formalist movement and its fashioners of stylistic tropes and producers of trompe éoeil.\nThe new materiality returns architecture and design to a rediscovery of the design foundations of a\nmaterial tectonics – albeit by the virtual route of Material Computation. It is a movement back to the\nfuture of materiality.\n\nAmong the paradoxical conditions of a transitional period is the hanging on to residual value that is still\nattached to formal uniqueness and invention as an indicator of value in architectural design. If anything, the\nconsumption of the image is still dominant despite the immanence of a different logic. This is particularly\n\n14\n\nthe case in what might be referred to as “organicism”, the modeling of architectural objects as natural, or\norganic bodies. To some extent, the wonders of computational modeling are responsible. However the\nimportant question is whether non-Euclidian geometry is an intrinsic indicator of the new (natural?)\nparadigm in design. Or is it simply that we are now capable of rethinking form, from the ground up, without\nany prejudgment regarding form, or the constraints of construction technology. Computational form-finding\nwould not become a necessary condition of a new architecture, but merely one possibility in the expanding\nformal vocabulary of performative design. If one important motive of the new theorists is to remove\narchitecture and urbanism from the cycle of stylistic consumption, then blobs and folds are innovative as\noutput and not as input.\n\nThe problems of such fallacies as a basis for cultural transformation are, as I have claimed, an obstacle to\nthe slow ascendance of the inevitable wedding of science, technology and design; of design as a science\nof the artificial. Feverous proponents of style, think again. Perhaps we have finally breathed our last\nparametricity.\n\n15\n\nReferences\n\n- Addington, Michelle and Schodek, Daniel (2004).
