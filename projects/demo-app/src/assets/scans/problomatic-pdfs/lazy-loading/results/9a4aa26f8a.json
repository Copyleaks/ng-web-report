Such prioritization of form over material was carried into\nthe development and design logic of CAD. Today, under the imperatives and growing recognition of the\nfailures and environmental liabilities of this approach, modern design culture is experiencing a shift to\nmaterial aware design.\nInspired by Nature’s strategies where form generation is driven by maximal performance with minimal\nresources through local material property variation, the research reviews, proposes and develops models\nand processes for a material-based approach in computationally enabled form-generation.\nMaterial-based Design Computation is developed and proposed as a set of computational strategies supporting the integration of form, material and structure by incorporating physical form-finding strategies\nwith digital analysis and fabrication. In this approach, material precedes shape, and it is the structuring\nof material properties as a function of structural and environmental performance that generates design\nform. The thesis proposes a unique approach to computationally-enabled form-finding procedures, and\nexperimentally investigates how such processes contribute to novel ways of creating, distributing and\ndepositing material forms.\nVariable Property Design is investigated as a theoretical and technical framework by which to model,\nanalyze and fabricate objects with graduated properties designed to correspond to multiple and continuously varied functional constraints. The following methods were developed as the enabling mechanisms\nof Material Computation: Tiling Behavior & Digital Anisotropy, Finite Element Synthesis, and Material\nPixels. In order to implement this approach as a fabrication process, a novel fabrication technology,\ntermed Variable Property Rapid Prototyping has been developed, designed and patented.\nAmong the potential contributions is the achievement of a high degree of customization through material\nheterogeneity as compared to conventional design of components and assemblies. Experimental designs employing suggested theoretical and technical frameworks, methods and techniques are presented,\ndiscussed and demonstrated. They support product customization, rapid augmentation and variable property fabrication. Developed as approximations of natural formation processes, these design experiments\ndemonstrate the contribution and the potential future of a new design and research field.\nThesis Supervisor: William J. Mitchell\nTitle:\nAlexander Dreyfoos Professor of Architecture and Media Arts and Sciences\nDepartment of Architecture, MIT\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nTo imagine is perhaps the most significant aspect of an architect’s creative agenda. Much built work\nand many design artifacts occupy our environment but few stir and shuffle the domains of knowledge in\na way so fundamental to cultural reorientation. Without imagination, innovation cannot be nurtured. I\nwould first like to thank my thesis adviser and mentor, Prof. Bill Mitchell, who taught me that what is\nnot surrounded by uncertainty, cannot be genuine and true; who encouraged me to take risk in defining\nmy search as I question the preconceptions of an era. Thank you, Bill, for guiding me in a journey so\ncharged with curiosity, and thank you for your consistently insightful input.\nMy thesis committee also included Prof. Lorna Gibson and Prof. Woodie Flowers from MIT. To them\nI owe the recognition of stepping with courage and grace inside my mind and helping direct my search\nfor the origin of form from the point of view of their own respective disciplines. Lorna: I thank you for\nyour patience and perseverance with my task to appropriate and implement concepts and methods from\nthe physical sciences to the domain of digital design. You have provided me with scientific grounding\ncoupled with a legitimacy to dream up my design ambitions; to me, you shall always remain a precious\ncolleague and a dear friend. Woodie: you are a force of nature. I thank you for your unqualified support\nof the creative aspects in my search, and for recognizing the value of design and engineering research\nas an art form. With faith, you have shaped my thinking and given me courage to take risks driven by\ncuriosity and curiosity alone.\nI cannot mention Bill and my committee without recognizing Cynthia Wilkes, Bill’s right hand, and a\nreal comrade! Cynthia, without your noble efforts in making feasible my interaction with Bill and the\ncommittee, this research would have not been made possible: genuine gratitude for caring and taking\naction with such an open heart.\nI came to MIT on a Presidential Fellowship, granted to me by the Department of Architecture upon my\narrival. My growth and evolution as a designer and design researcher would have never been made possible without such impressive support. I would like to thank the Dean, Prof. Adele Santos for following my\nwork from its premature and highly conceptual stages (“dreams”), through its reformulation as a field of\nknowledge. I would also like to thank the Department Head, Prof. Yung Ho Chang for humbly insisting\nthat I respect my design intuition and cultivate visions for the future. Very special thanks I shall also\nextend to the administrative team at the department. Renee: your insightful suggestions and planning\nstrategies have made all of this achievable, in good time and upbeat spirit. Thank you for your eloquence\nand your guidance. Annette: a very special thank you for making sure I collected and read my mail in\ntime, and thank you for simply being there with an optimism that is challenging to conjure under pressure.\nWhile at work, I shared two homes spanning the far edges of the Infinite Corridor between building 9 and\nbuilding E15. In Building 9, I spent much time with my fellow colleagues at the Computation Group.\nHowever, it is mostly due to its directors and faculty that I was able to refine my research both as an\nacademic framework and as an experimental practice. I owe much gratitude to Prof. George Stiny for\ndiligently embracing and promoting experimentalism in design. George, your pro-seminar series has\nshaped my thinking through the many discussions that we shared about shape grammars and their value\nin design practice, and in life. I would also like to thank Prof. Terry Knight for her ongoing support and\n\nher friendship during the years that I have spent as a group member. Other faculty to whom I am in debt\nfor creative and intellectual stimulus include Prof. Dennis Shelden, who was one of the very first faculty\nmembers in the department to present me with the mathematical foundations which later helped inspire\na material-based approach to design vis-à-vis the “formalist project” so engrained in contemporary practice. Dennis, your lectures and works in the field of computational geometry have had an invaluable\nimpact on my thinking, and I look forward, with enthusiasm, to future collaboration. I would also like\nto thank Prof. Larry Sass for his support and encouragement with regard to the experimental mentality\nwhich I have implemented in my work, and more specifically, its implications on the domain of digital\nfabrication and construction. Thank you also to Prof. Edith Ackerman with whom I have shared many\nengaging discussions in various contexts, and who has constantly questioned the cultural and humane\nsignificance of the production of artifacts.\nI would like to extend warm gratitude to my countless good friends and colleagues at the Computation Group. Thank you Saeed, Sergio, Kaustuv, Daniel, Kenfield, Mitch, Axel, Yanni, Lira and Maria\namongst many others, for your invaluable friendship and support and for cultivating a discourse from\nthe bottom-up that is informed by designing first and theorizing later. A special thank you to my friend\nand colleague Alexandros, with whom I have shared the very first discussions regarding the nature of\nphysical matter and its potential contribution to form-generation absent of iconic value yet so charged\nand thrilling with beauty. Within the Computation Group, I would also like to thank the wonderful administrative team that has supported me. In particular, I would like to thank Daniela Stoudenkova for\nhelping me carry out the Computation Lecture Series of which I have been in charge from 2006 to 2009,\nwith utmost grace and conscientiousness.\nIt was at the Media Lab where I studied and later produced many of the physical models which are included in this thesis. I would like to give special thanks to Prof. Frank Moss, Director, for identifying\na voice in my work that was valued and embraced throughout my time at the lab. I would also like to\nthank Prof. Neil Gershenfeld and his fabulous team at the CBA for allowing me to be productive not\nwithout a sense of naı̈veté. Thank you, Neil, for inspiring me to “make almost anything”. And thank\nyou, fabbers (Manu, Amon, Kenny, Amy and Ara), for guiding me through the lore of milling, cutting,\ncasting, printing and molding.\nIt was in the Media Lab where I had the unique opportunity to examine my ideas within an industrial\ncontext and one which celebrates the intersection between the arts and the sciences. I obtained direct and\nindirect invaluable input from many colleagues. Amongst others, I would like to acknowledge insightful\nand influential conversations with Prof. Cynthia Breazeal, Prof. Hiroshi Ishii, Prof. Pattie Maes and,of\ncourse, Prof. Nicholas Negroponte and Prof. Tod Machover with whom I have recently had the honor to\ninteract and collaborate in the fun-palace called the Media Lab. I would like to express special gratitude\ntowards my good friend and colleague, Prof. Hugh Herr who continues to present me with intellectual\nand technical challenges in the scope of the theoretical framework offered by my thesis. I have obtained\ninvaluable insight into my work through its potential applications in the fields of prosthetic device design\nand product design in general. More specifically, I have been inspired by the potential application of the\nVariable Property Design method in the design of biologically-inspired exo-skeletons and augmentation\ndevices. I look forward to further developing this approach as an alternative framework replacing the\nnow-predominant presence of components and assemblies in the design of wearable devices. Thank you,\nHugh, for inspiring me to think above and beyond all boundaries in turning dreams into reality (“this is\nwhat we’re here for!”). I would also like to thank Robert Swartz, patent lawyer at the Media Lab for\n\nassisting me in patenting the VPRP technology and recommending interesting industrial paths without\ncompromising the beauty of creative abstraction.\nWithin the framework of my teaching, and research-assistantship at the Media Lab, I have been associated with the Smart Cities Group, directed by my adviser, Prof. Bill Mitchell. I would like to thank those\nmembers of the group with whom I have shared discussions about the nature of automobile design and\nthe future of FAB. More specifically, I would like to thank Peter, Susanne, Ryan, Retro, Arthur, Andres,\nWill, Dimitris and Michael. Peter: sharing an office at the cube with you was a real treat and a rare\nopportunity to take pleasure in observing creative genius.\nWithin the Media Lab, I wish to extend special gratitude to my UROPS, Rachel Fong and Mindy Eng,\nwho have both worked diligently to help design, fabricate and assemble the first prototypes for the a\nVariable Property 3-D Printer (VPRP). Mindy: your most recent explorations into property driven design\nfabrication through materials testing, software development and mechanical design have made me realize\nI am more of a learner than an educator. Thank you for your courage in undertaking work in a field so\nimpulsive in its birth and for confirming its academic merit by further developing it.\nThank you, also, Marcelo Coelho and Sajid Sadi from the Media Lab’s Fluid Interfaces Group with\nwhom I have collaborated in the context of Transitive Materials: an ongoing research platform promoting an integrated approach to material technology. Sajid, thank you for your friendship and support\nthroughout my thinking and my writing, and thank you for your constructive criticism with which you\nhave an exceptional way.\nNow, a few thank you notes to teachers, friends and colleagues outside the Department of Architecture.\nOne is tremendously lucky to find mentorship by way of cultivating creative commune. Such mentorship is rare to come by and I have been honored to have found one in my good friend and colleague,\nProf Craig Carter. Craig: your research and your work, along with the many conversations that we have\nshared regarding the role of materials and their behavior in the design of objects and buildings, as agents\nfor form-generation predominant to form itself, have helped refine my research field as well as inspire\nthe development and implementation of my computational methods. More specifically, the development\nof the Finite-Element-Synthesis method, promoting the integration of form generation through analysis\nand the concept of “digital growth” were inspired by an object oriented FEA environment developed by\nyou and your team at NIST. But, more importantly, you have been a dear friend to me and an inspiration.\nThank you for your generosity in time and in knowledge throughout the various stages of the thesis process. Thank you for your collaboration on several of the design projects presented in this thesis; you have\nencouraged me to think about the generative qualities of each algorithm as they were being conceived.\nBeyond this, thank you for your sense of naı̈veté in creative production, without which no creative work\ncan be born. I know we shall share many such exciting projects in the future.\nFrom the GSD, I would like to thank Prof. Mohsen Mostafavi and Prof. Preston Scott Cohen for giving\nme the opportunity to present my work to a community so entrenched in design culture on the other side\nof Mass Ave. I would also like to thank Prof. Daniel Schodek for his comments and support. Finally,\nspecial gratitude to Prof. Sanford Kwinter for being such a noble provocateur and one so thrillingly\npresent in an emerging discourse.\n\nFrom the Architectural Association in London, I would like to thank Prof. Michael Weinstock for providing me with continuous support and inspiration. Mike, I hope to someday return to the AA to celebrate a\nnew era. A very special thank you to Prof. George Jeronimidis, Director of the Center for Biomimetics\nin Reading, and Professor at the AA. George: our many discussions regarding the role of heterogeneity\nand differentiation in Nature have helped me review, structure and demonstrate in a succinct manner,\nsome of the most significant ideas that I believe this thesis has to offer. I would also like to acknowledge\nProf. Achim Menges for his insight and for his friendship.\nI have had the great honor to collaborate with various colleagues from a wide array of disciplines.\nAt SOM, Neil Katz has supported and inspired my work into material-based tessellation from which\nsprang the Tiling Behavior method documented in this thesis. Neil: thank you for urging me beyond parameterization and for appreciating the beauty in things, simply because they are beautiful. Prof. Nancy\nCheng has gracefully yet powerfully encouraged me to present my work in CAD conferences such as\neCAADe and ACADIA as I exposed and tested some of my research ideas within a scientific community.\nProf. Andrew Kudless has been my good friend and college since we have met at the AA. Thank you,\nAndrew, for nurturing collaboration so passionate and lively with content. Additional thanks to all of our\ncollaborators on ACADIA 2008: Silicon + Skin and the organizing committee: Prof. Marc Swackhamer,\nProf. Billie Faircloth, Prof. Kiel Moe, Prof. David Gissen and the ACADIA community who has helped\nus shift the discourse. Prof. John Hart: thank you for your continuous collaboration on Construction\nIn-Vivo which won us the HOLCIM award for sustainable construction. I hope to further implement\nour “breathing walls” in full size prototypes in the very near future as we continue our explorations for\nappropriating a Material-based Design Computation approach within your own framework of research\ninto nanotubes. Jesse Louis-Rosenberg: thank you for your collaboration on papers and projects leading\nthe way towards the integration of physical matter and digital computational techniques. I still wear your\njewelry.\nI would like to thank the many organizations that have supported my work by allowing me to use their\nresources and recognized the value of my work by giving me an opportunity to display or demonstrate it\npublicly.\nThank you to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in NY, and specifically to Paola Antonelli and Patricia Juncosa for curating Design and the Elastic Mind and making Natural Artifice part of its permanent\ncollection. Paola as mentor and friend has done much to teach me the values of technology as the content\nof cultural traditions and the cultural contribution of revolutionary design experimentalism. Thank you,\nFrancesca von Habsburg, for taking interest in my work and vision and helping me turn it onto a reality\nto live by (and in!). I look forward to celebrating our new project in Jamiaca. Thank you, Marie Ange\nBrayer for allowing me to present my work at the BIACS in Seville and for making Raycounting part\nof the FRAC collection in Orléans. Thank you to the Museum of Science Boston for putting together an\nexhibition of my work (At the Frontier of Ecological Design) and for allowing me the unique opportunity\nto consider the scientific contribution of my work as valuable to the public. Lisa, Azriel, MJ and Monica:\nyou have all made me feel at home at the intersection of design and science. Thank you to the Media Lab\nshop managers, John DiFrancesco and Tom Lutz, for letting me conduct wild experiments in the wee\nhours of the night. Thank you to the Council of the Arts at MIT for supporting me with various grants\nand exhibitions. Thank you to the HOLCIM foundation for sustainable construction for allowing me the\nopportunity to test my approach in a technical framework. Thank you to the Earth Awards team for help-\n\ning me achieve recognition as I completed the first prototypes for VPRP (code name: FAB.REcology).\nWithout the support of companies and various corporate sponsors none of the experimental modeling\nwork would have been made possible. Thank you to the following companies: Objet Geometries, ARRK\nProduct Development Group, Tangible Express, Z Corporation and RPM’s Machining for their support\nand invaluable technical advice in the production of experimental models.\nA few special and rather eclectic notes of thanks:\nThank you John Brockman and Katinka Matson for making me feel at home in EDGE. What has started\nfor me as a manifesto when I was first introduced to The Third Culture has now transformed into a new\nway of thinking. I value your mission and honor its implications on world knowledge and science literacy. Thank you Adam Bly and the SEED team for identifying significance in my agenda and making\npublic contemporary design discourse: viva la révolution. Thank you, Lee Smolin, for all our intriguing\ntalks about physics, design and the nature of the universe, a-la Bucky Fuller. You are an inspiration. Enrique Norten: thank you for your long-lasting friendship as I jumped through the hoops of practice and\nacademia, and thank you for your continuous support of the experimental nature of my work. You are a\ndear friend to me. Thank you to Bruce Sterling who in heroically riding the shaky apogée of predictive\njournalism in Wired and avante garde European design technology venues has been a distant and valued\ninterlocutor though we have never met or spoken.\nMy close friends have been to me like a secret weapon to get through the hard times, with love and\nwith emotional endurance that is rare to find. Jeff: your true friendship has earned me the recognition of\nwhat is truly important in life. Thank you for introducing me to The Power of Now and to the idea that\nbeing alive and being creative is really the same thing (and thank god for hot yoga!). Rony: your faith\nin my work and my thesis has kept me going. Your genuine support and friendship provided me with\nthe authority to strive for truly world changing ideas as I step into my new position. I would not have\nbeen able to do this without you and I am honored to be a friend to you. Simon: your constant presence\nand appreciation of my work and my writings have been invaluable. Thank you for pointing me towards\nawe-inspiring images of Nature and for insisting that I remain true to my intuition. Jay and Jodi: you\nhave both taught me patience and unassuming perseverance during hard times. You have taught me the\nsecrets of ujjayi breath as a matter of being. Nadav and Maya: thank you for reminding me of what it\n(really) means to be a true Israeli: straightforward, courageous and to the point. Adam: thank you for\nyour long-lasting friendship and for showing me how much can be done with so little. With unspoken\nheroics, you have set an example for all of us to follow. Eva: you are a kindred spirit to me and I admire\nyour ways of being in this world, as your brilliant future novels will unfold. Thank you for your gift of\nfriendship. Kevin: area code is just but one aspect of your impeccable taste in storytelling and urban\nliving. Thank you for seeing the child in me.\nTo my precious friend Mikey: you have been a best friend to me since the moment I have met you and\nsuch you shall forever remain. Thank you for your genuine support with my demanding work; thank you\nfor your patience and your integrity, and thank you for teaching me how to live with a beginner’s mind.\nA warm expression of gratitude and love to Michal and Moshe Safdie, who have been there for me\nthroughout my triumphs and my struggles: Moshe, your ways have shown me that one can build one’s\ndreams. I promise to follow humbly. Michal: your graceful friendship and faith in me and my work will\n\nforever give me the will and the power to remain true to my values.\nAnd finally, to my close family, which have been there for me since the very beginning and has relentlessly supported me in every step I took. Keren: You are my best and most precious friend. It is because\nof you that I left Medical School and found my true love in Architecture. Your art is an inspiration for\nthe world to witness, and I love you and Tomer immensely. Mother: you define what beauty is. With\nbrilliance, elegance, and humor you have made my life’s journey worthwhile. You have taught me everything I know of the ways of the world and you continue to move and surprise me with your awe-inspiring\nwisdom and your divine grace. Father: to you I owe everything. Thank you for providing me with a home\nthat is a heaven to the mind and thank you for teaching me that life is not worth living without taking\nrisks. Thank you both, for letting me grow as an individual and for letting me take the road less traveled.\nIt is because of you that I shall never give up my dreams. Osvaldo, my beloved: your unconditional love,\nyour support and your trust in me are beyond anything I have ever experienced. I thank you for giving\nme the gift of wonder and for making me feel at home within my self. That has made all the difference.\n\nTo Bill\n\nTable of Contents\n1\n\nNOTES ON THE SYNTHESIS OF MATERIAL FORM\n1.1 The Crisis of Form . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

FORM\nAn Introduction\n\n“I believe in God, only I spell it Nature.”\n– Frank Lloyd Wright\n“Buildings, too, are children of Earth and Sun.”\n– Frank Lloyd Wright\n\n1.1\n\nThe Crisis of Form\n\nOver the long trajectory of architectural design history, the design and production of artifacts has been\ncharacterized by the growing separation of form-making from its natural foundations in material conditions. In contradistinction to craft production (Sennett 2008) in which material and form are naturally\nintertwined into a tradition of making, modern design and production have historically evolved away\nfrom this integration towards the compartmentalization of form-making as a process independent of its\nsources in material knowledge. At least since the Renaissance, with the emergence of architectural theories, form-making, as the production of form inspired by theory, has become an autonomous body of\nknowledge. Within architecture and industrial design, the most culturally sensitive of the productive\ndesign fields, form has grown in both eminence and temporal precedence in the design process to the\npoint that the condition of form preceding materialization has become normative and virtually intuitive\nin contemporary design culture. With the exception of few pioneering cases in contemporary design, the\nsecularization and debasement of the material realm has become axiomatic. Materiality is, within the\nlogic of the modernist tradition, an agency secondary to form.\nThe Industrial Revolution laid open the door to machine-based manufacturing and mass production. The\ncreation of form was now to be conceived and created by the power of industrial automation; functionality took over as the leading standard and the principal ontology (Jencks 1984). Form was to follow\nfunction and ornament, so endemic to craft culture, became crime (Frampton and Futagawa 1980). The\nvalues promoted by ancient crafts, pronounced by the integration of material substance and construction\nmethods, once within the province of the craftsman, were abandoned while in their place emerged a design practice based on values of mass production. Fast, cheap, repetitive and modular building types and\nparts were synonymous with Ford’s visionary dream. Industry’s victory aside, it seemed as if design’s\n\nThe Crisis of Form 27\n\npropinquity to ancient crafts and its design expressions as portrayed by vernacular forms of design was\nnow doomed lost; and with it the intimate context of material technologies. Eventually, this non-material\napproach to the design and the automation of construction were to be reinforced under the command of\ncomputer aided design.\nThe digital revolution, which marked the change from analog to digital technology, has transformed the\ndesigner’s drafting board into a digital canvas. Form, it seemed, was now divorced completely from\nthe physical reality of its manifestation. Granted, these new design spaces afforded much liberation in\nterms of formal expression, but it has also broadened the gap between form and matter and made the\nhierarchical and sequential separation of modeling, analysis and fabrication processes infinitely more\npronounced.\nThe implementation and broad absorption of enhanced computational design tools in architectural practice has, since the early nineties, motivated a renaissance of the formalist project in architecture; geometrically complex shapes became emblems of creativity in digital design environments and supported the\ndesign mastery of complex geometries in form generation. This formal and geometric design orientation\nhas also addressed “free form” design and architecture along with their enabling technologies as part of\nthe larger design phenomenon of the “mass customization” of “non-standard” form.\nToday, perhaps under the imperatives of the growing recognition of the ecological failures of modern\ndesign, design culture is witnessing a new materiality. Within the last decade in both industrial design\nand architecture, a new body of knowledge is emerging through various industrial and academic research\ninitiatives (Mitchell and McCullough 1991; Mitchell 2001; Shelden and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Architecture. 2002). Examples of the growing interest in the technological potential\nof innovative material usage and material innovation as a source of design generation are developments\nin biomaterials, mediated and responsive materials, as well as composite materials (McQuaid, Beesley\net al. 2005). With the growing relevance of hybridized and mediated materialization, new frontiers of\nmaterial science as a design science are supporting the emergence of new perspectives in architectural\nand industrial design. Thus the role of digital design research as the enabling environment of the transformation to a new age of material-based design in various design disciplines has become the cutting edge\nof computational design research. Here we are at the cusp of the emergence of a new field of research\nat the interaction of Materials Science & Engineering and Design Computation: Material-based Design\nComputation.\nAccompanying the rise of what might be termed a new materiality as a phenomenon of the interactions\nbetween contemporary developments in scientific, technological and industrial design culture has been\nthe recognition of the relevance of a unique body of precedents. New research into the forgotten pioneers\nof what is termed form-finding processes, that is, the exploitation of material properties and behavior as a\nsource of form-generation in the pre-digital era (Otto, Glaeser et al. 1972; Otto, Herzog et al. 1990; Otto\nand Rasch 1995; Otto, Nerdinger et al. 2005), are now found to be of growing relevance. Processes in\ndevelopmental biology and morphology, particularly in the areas of material characterizations of developmental processes, are studied as sources of principles for the design of innovative material structures\n(Thom 1975; Ruse and Hull 1989; Paton 1992; Goodwin 1994; Kauffman 2000; Kumar and Bentley\n2003; Forbes 2004; Bar-Cohen 2006). More specifically, the notion of mimicking natural structures\nin the synthesis of new materials and processes has generated enormous interest in both the scientific\nand design communities. As this network of knowledge sources and resources develops, a new material sensibility in product and building scale is becoming crystallized and formulated. This new design\nsensibility carries with it certain potential ecological repercussions and intrinsic values that may be of\nsignificance in any future implementations of Material-based Design Computation.\nMaterial-based Design Computation attempts to inculcate material properties and environmental con-\n\n28 NOTES ON THE SYNTHESIS OF MATERIAL FORM\n\nditions within the computational form-generation processes of design.

It is, perhaps, the troika structure of its theoretical resources\nwhich enlightens the proposal of Material-based Design Computation as a new research field:\n• Nature’s Way, or Natural Design, is seen through the perspectives of morphology Biomimetics.\nBoth of these fields elucidate Nature’s processes of design as design principles and morphological\nknowledge which are relevant to the generation of material form;\n• Material Science & Engineering offers precedents and formalisms for the description of material\nform and structure. Such precedents, their descriptive formalisms, and their scientific exactitude\nprovide the foundations for certain of the methods which are required for material-based computational processes;\n• Design Computation provides models of computation and formalisms of computational representation that can be employed in the research in order to integrate analytical procedures with form\ngenerative processes to achieve an approach to design that incorporates material properties as a\npotential driver of form-generative processes.\nThe unique integration of these three bodies of scientific and design knowledge contributes to the development of the new field of Material-based Design Computation. They constitute the theoretical foundations and the methodological resources of the research which is explicated in Chapters 2, 3, and 4.\nIn proposing an alternative approach to form generation in design, in general, and to architectural and\nindustrial design form generation, in particular, and in demonstrating the potential for a profound transformation of content and methods in design computation, the research assumes as background certain of\nthe core problems of design in an age of mediated technologies.\nAxiomatic to the awesome proportions of this problem statement are, of course, the reciprocal advantages of the potential effects of this work. In recognizing and repeatedly referring in these pages to the\nphenomena of “a crisis of form” in architecture and design, the alternative culture of this work promotes\nnatural design and the new materiality as one potential antidote to the “crisis of human environment”.\nThe potential ecological significance of this work is profound in its willingness to address certain of\nthe root pathological conditions of the culture of waste by reconsidering the role of materials in design\ngeneration and production.\n1.1.1\n\nOrganization and Structure of Thesis\n\nThe thesis is structured in 9 chapters. Following Chapter 1, Chapters 2, 3 and 4, provide for background\nconcepts and ideas from the fields of Biology, Material Science & Engineering, and Design Computation respectively. Combined, these three chapters make up the background segment of the thesis, laying\n\nThe Crisis of Form 29\n\ntheoretical and technical foundations that appear to be useful and significant in support of its arguments.\nMore specifically, Chapter 2 (entitled: Nature’s Way: Material Form and the Structuring of Difference)\nprovides a general approach to the thesis by considering the relation between form and matter in Nature\nas a model for design generation that is potentially more sustainable than conventional design processes\nof form-generation and production. Considering natural formation processes relevant to the thesis, this\nchapter reviews: the hierarchical structure and heterogeneity of properties of biological materials; growth\nresponse of biological materials to loading; and the role of anisotropy in biological materials. In Chapter 3 (entitled: The New Materiality: Sources and Development of a Design Cultural Phenomenon)\napproaches inspired by Nature pointing towards the potential integration between form and material in\ndesign are presented, and instrumental definitions from the domains of material science & engineering\nare given. Here, engineering materials are considered vis-á-vis Nature’s Way as the potential substance\nto be recomposed and reformed according to principles and methods presented in the previous chapter.\nThe review of engineering materials includes: cellular solids and composites; tiling; functionally graded\nmaterials; engineering shape optimization analysis; finite element analysis and biomimicking. Chapter\n4 (entitled: Design Computation: Digital Engines for the Structuring of Matter) provides the technical means by which to consider, conceptualize and implement a new approach to design computation\nsupporting the integration of physical properties within a form-generation environment. The aim here\nis to review state-of-the-art computational tools, techniques and technologies that carry the potential to\nsupport a new approach to design.\nChapters 5 through 8 provide the core chapters of the research description: they represent the body of\nknowledge and experimental frameworks associated with a new design approach entitled Material-based\nDesign Computation. Chapter 5 (entitled: Design Computation: Digital Engines for the Structuring of\nMatter) lays out the theoretical and technical foundations for the approach, directly followed by Chapter 6 (entitled: Material-based Design Computation: Methodological Frameworks) which presents the\nmethodological frameworks designed to explore some of the issues and questions raised in the previous chapter. Chapter 7 (entitled: Natural Artifice: Experiments in Material-based Design Computation)\npresents the collection of design experiments, design products and design tools demonstrating the approach of Material-based Design Computation. The designs and implementations presented demonstrate\nsome of the ideas put forth in the earlier chapters of the thesis, especially the notion of material property and thickness variation within form-generation processes. Chapter 8 (entitled: Natural Fabrication:\nVariable Property Rapid Prototyping Technology) presents a novel technology, designed, developed, and\npatented to support the theoretical and technical ideas explored through the experiments. It describes\na novel rapid prototyping machine allowing the deposition of material with continuous property variation coupled with improved control of material properties over a single fabrication. Chapter 9 (entitled:\nContributions: Material Computation: the Foundation of Material Ecology) presents the conclusions,\ncontributions and limitations of the thesis.\nCombined, the thesis is comprised of three background chapters following the introduction (Ch. 2, 3,\n4), four chapters devoted to Material-based Design Computation (Ch. 5, 6, 7, 8), and a concluding\nchapter(Ch. 9).\n1.1.2\n\nOrganization and Structure of Introduction\n\nThe following introductory sections are organized according to the structure of this thesis; each section\nrepresents one out of the nine chapters that make up this work. Each section carries the title of its\nrespective chapter and within it, a short summary.\n\n30 NOTES ON THE SYNTHESIS OF MATERIAL FORM\n\n1.2\n\nNature’s Way: Material Form and the Structuring of Difference\n\nChapter 2 is set out as an explication of the intimate relation between material, structure and form in\nNature, and ways by which such integration is achieved. Principles of natural form as a function of\nperformance are reviewed and considered as potentially providing design guidelines. The main assertion\nis that in Nature, material is heterogeneously distributed to fit its structural and/or environmental performance, and that such structural heterogeneity (also termed difference, or differentiation) is made possible\ndue to the integration between form, structure and material (Figure 1.1). Two case studies focusing on\ntrees and bones, and representing classes of fiber-structures and cellular solids are reviewed, and related\ninstrumental definitions are presented and discussed. The remodeling of bone tissue as it responds to\nfunctional demands of mechanical loading is presented alongside similar processes observed in a fully\nfunctioning wood tissue.\nThe advantages of material distribution and structural heterogeneity as observed in Nature are discussed\nand proposed as an alternative strategy to conventionalized design processes of form-making. This strategy stands in contrast to the current state of design of homogeneous components from lower level assemblies where a singular material lacking variation in thickness or proerty, is assigned to a given shape.\nFinally, some design dichotomies that are unpronounced in Nature (such as the dichotomy between structure and material) are discussed and speculations regarding their significance to design are presented.\nThe overarching principle brought forth is that contrary to a form-first approach in design, in Nature the\ntypical hierarchical design sequence form-structure-material is typically inverted bottom-up as material\ninforms structure which, in turn, informs the shape of “naturally designed” specimens (Vincent 1982). By\nthe end of this chapter we ask: how can a material first approach, prioritizing environmental performance\nand material behavior over form, be accommodated by design, and in what stages of the design process\ncan such an approach be implemented? What new design possibilities emerge, and what might their\npotential significance be?\n1.3\n\nThe New Materiality: Sources and Development of a Design Cultural Phenomenon\n\nThe chapter begins by suggesting that the disintegration between form, material and structure, so emblematic of contemporary design has lead to a parallel disintegration in design method pronounced by\nthe partitioning between modeling, analysis and fabrication. Such disintegration, as we shall claim, may\npotentially result in the prioritization of expressive shape over environmental performance.\nCompared to Nature, our own material strategies appear to be much less effective, and generally quite\nwasteful. Since the industrialized age, the construction industry has been dependant on discrete solutions\nfor distinct functions (Oxman 2008; Oxman 2008; Oxman 2008). Building skins are a great example of\nsuch a claim.\nSteel and glass possess significantly different structural and environmental properties which relate to significantly different performance requirements. Diversity is achieved by sizing, rather than by substance\nvariation, and it is typically mass produced, not customized. As far as material structuring is considered,\nin the artificial world, especially in the construction industry, one property fits all.\nAs we shall demonstrate, the assumption that discrete solids are made from single materials is deeply\nembedded in modernist design thinking, and typically unquestioned. Furthermore, it is enforced by the\nway that industrial supply chains work. At their lowest levels, supply chains are driven by component\nmanufacturing processes performed by highly specialized machines operating on particular materials to\nproduce low-level subassemblies. But can Nature’s ability be emulated in the design of the artificial?\nWith the assistance of advances in structural and material engineering entering contemporary digital\npractice, design culture appears poised for transformation (Figure 1.2). Designers now seek to advance\n\nThe New Materiality 31\n\nNature’s strategies in structuring matter by designing synthetic multifunctional materials competing with\nevolutions unrestricted time-frame of design process. Fitness, not form, is what actually matters. In\nChapter 3 the new materiality is recognized by proposing that in mimicking Nature’s way, materials\nare to be designed for highly customized functions rather than simply be selected and assigned to preconceived shapes. This requires the transformation from a culture of material selection to one of material\ndesign, as well as the utilization of heterogeneous and variable properties that may potentially correspond\nto a given set of performance criteria.\nThe main aim of the chapter is to introduce certain design principles in material practice in which the\ncontrol and structuring of material organization is informed by material performance constraints. Later\nwe shall see how those principles may come to express themselves in the digital domain, and then to be\nfurther combined with shape-generation processes to foster seamless relations between material behavior\nand geometry.\nGiven Nature’s way, which prioritizes the function of structural and environmental performance as the\nforces shaping matter into shape (and not the other way around), the chapter suggests ways in which to\nconsider a graduated properties approach to materials characterized by structural heterogeneity across\nscales as it may correspond to various loads and constraints.\nDesigned anisotropy is suggested as the path into a more biologically inspired method for informed\nmaterial distribution. This ability, it is proposed, will ultimately allow the designer to design materials\nthat vary their properties in correspondence with the forces acting upon them. Indeed, the design world\nis swiftly catching up with Nature’s secrets by engineering variable density materials. Such materials are\nresponsive in the sense that their microstructure is optimized to specific performance requirements (such\nas mechanical loads) as demonstrated through the family of functionally gradient materials.\nMoreover, there exist numerous examples of products and building components which have been fabricated and manufactured by means of varying material properties across volume sections to correspond\nwith structural loads and other stimuli. This was the predominant method of all forms of craft throughout history. With the composites industry undergoing massive expansion, many industries are revisiting\nthe role of materials in the shaping of products such as automobiles, airplanes, sail boats and so on.\nCase studies from both ancient and contemporary periods are reviewed and discussed in relation to their\nform-generation processes.\nThe dichotomy between overall structural shape and local material properties is addressed, alongside\nother dichotomies presented in Chapter 2. Finally, certain limitations of material-based design are addressed pointing towards the shift from material selection to material design and its potential significance\nin the digital domain as part of the form-generation process.\n1.4\n\nDesign Computation: Digital Engines for the Structuring of Matter\n\nThe treatment of materiality by CAD follows from certain of the presuppositions presented in the previous chapters. In this light, traditional CAD and BIM systems are fundamentally limited in their capacity\nto represent graduated or continuously heterogeneous material properties. Their basic strategy is simply\nto assign a material property to a closed solid or a closed surface polygon. In this respect, such tools are\nrather limiting to designers who wish to explore and design with graduated properties.\nIndeed, since its emergence in the 1960’s, computer aided design (CAD) in its many transformations has\nafforded the designer with an almost effortless manipulation of shapes generally detached from their fabrication in material form (Figure 1.3). Such processes promote the application of material subsequent to\nthe generation of form. Even when supported by high-fidelity analytical tools for analysis and optimization, these processes are predominantly linked to geometrical manipulations in three dimensions. Design\n\n32 NOTES ON THE SYNTHESIS OF MATERIAL FORM\n\nculture now requires a shift from a geometric-centric to a material-based approach in computationally\nenabled form-generation.\nThe main argument presented in this chapter is that certain design conventions prior to the age of digital\ndesign have been preserved and re-appropriated in CAD. Such, for instance, is the notion that a product\nor a building is typically made up of lower level components and parts put together by higher-level\nassemblies. Each component is geometrically designed as a structural element (i.e. post, beam, or\nsurface element) and then assigned its material.\nThe objective of Chapter 4 is to review the evolution of concepts and issues in design-computation\nthat are relevant to the integration of physical parameters within digital form-generation, analysis and\nfabrication environments and explore their potential to support a seamless integration between matter\nand shape. Certain computational paradigms inspired by Nature and the physical world are proposed as\nrelevant to this objective and their limitations presented.\nCurrent methods for material representation in design are reviewed in both generative (modeling) and\nsynthetic (analysis & fabrication) computational environments. Voxels, maxels, finite-elements, particles\nand vague-discrete modeling elements are presented as potential “digital units” that may incorporate local\nphysical information as informed by environmental constraints.\nThe chapter concludes with the limitations presented by computational media to represent more than a\nsingular physical property. In addition, and more significant to the research objectives, computational\ntools with physical orientation are currently mainly used for purposes of optimization rather than processes of form-generation. However, if such computational units could potentially represent variable\nproperties and could also be assembled as a function of structural and environmental performance, a new\napproach to design supporting performance-oriented form-generation processes could be developed and\nimplemented.\n1.5\n\nMaterial-based Design Computation 1: Theoretical and Technical Foundations\n\nDefined as the process of computationally enabled form-finding, informed by material properties and environmental constraints, Material-based Design Computation promotes an integrated approach to design,\nwhereby material properties inform the geometrical generation of three- dimensional form. Chapter 5\nintroduces the theoretical and technical foundations of Material-based Design Computation developed to\nsupport a new universal approach to the problem of digital form-generation with continuously varying\nmaterial properties satisfying prescribed material conditions on a finite collection of material features\nand global constraints.\nResearch assumptions, goals, objectives and questions are defined and presented, addressing ways by\nwhich to achieve the integration of physical considerations within the generation of form in order to\nefficiently distribute materials and properties relative to the type of forces defined by the environment.\nThis condition assumes a given material volumes to which are assigned various forces resulting in its\nreorganization of physical distribution and property variation.\nGiven the assumption that a graduated properties approach to the design of objects and buildings also\nappears to be of certain potential value to the emerging field of sustainable design in its promotion of environmental customization, we seek to define, explore, demonstrate and evaluate computational processes\nsupporting such goals. The aim is to arrive at a design approach favoring high levels of customization\nover mass production; integrating between modeling, analysis and fabrication environments; utilizing\na graduated property approach to the design of objects; and overall prioritizing material considerations\nover geometric expression.\n\nMaterial-based Design Computation 1 33\n\n1.6\n\nMaterial-based Design Computation 2: Methodological Frameworks\n\nChapter 6 presents a set of methodological frameworks corresponding to the goals, aims, issues and questions introduced in the previous chapter. Experimental design methods and models are applied both to\ngenerate and to evaluate the design experiments illustrated in the following two chapters. These methodological frameworks focus on the two reoccurring themes that were identified as endemic to natural\ndesign: the achievement of the multi-functional / mass-customized artifacts through a graduated material property approach, and the exploitation of an integrated conception-construction process in order\nto achieve computationally-enabled form-finding environments. Both of these objectives are intimately\nrelated.\nThe methodological frameworks include the development of three concepts relevant and instrumental\nto the experimental work carried out and presented in Chapters 7 and 8. These concepts include a\nvariable-property modeling concept, the concept of property, and distribution-driven digital anisotropy,\nand finally, the concept of computational material units, also entitled material pixels.\nThe variable property design environment (VPD) is a design approach, a methodology, and a technical framework, by which to model, simulate and fabricate material assemblies with varying properties\ndesigned to correspond to multiple and continuously varied functional constraints. Such capability is\nlater also termed synthetic anisotropy pointing towards the designer’s ability to strategically control the\ndensity and directionality of material substance in the generation of form. In this approach, material precedes shape, and it is the structuring of material properties as a function of performance that anticipates\ntheir form. The theoretical and technical foundations for this approach have been termed, Material-based\nDesign Computation.\nMaterial units are presented and defined per a given design environment: within modeling processes,\nthe designer may consider tessellation strategies that are property-driven (as opposed to the now classical curvature-driven approach); within analytical processes, the designer may consider a mesh unit to\ncorrespond to more than one objective function (i.e. load and light); and, within fabrication processes,\nthe designer may consider a “material pixel”, also referred to in the literature as a “maxel”, as a unit\nnegotiating between digital modeling units and units of physical fabrication. These three environments\n(modeling, analysis and fabrication) correspond respectively to the methodological frameworks offered\nby tiling behavior, finite synthesis method and variable property fabrication.\nVarious definitions of material pixels are given as a function of the type of performance requirements\nthat are considered (e.g. pressure maxels respond to load, thermal maxels to heat, light maxels to light,\ncomfort maxels to physiological requirements, and so on).\n1.7\n\nNatural Artifice: Experiments in Material-based Design Computation\n\nThe mechanical response of physical forms driven by, and engineered with, spatial gradients (heterogeneity, or difference) in composition and structure appears to be of considerable significance in all sub\ndisciplines of design: from architecture, to product design, to material design as well as to the technologies to fabricate and construct them. Chapter 7 illustrates a series of experiments in Material-based\nDesign Computation in the design of various objects under diverse environmental conditions; these include as a culmination of the range of experiments the comprehensive design of two functional products.\nIt is important to note that each project utilizes a particular methodological framework or some combination of multiple methods. The research is experimental, and various methods are experimentally\nimplemented at various phases of the design process in order to systematically and comprehensively\nexplore the research issues and questions presented.\nThe design experiments presented in this work are ordered and classified by the type of performance\n\n34 NOTES ON THE SYNTHESIS OF MATERIAL FORM\n\nconsiderations which they address. Monocoque, Cartesian Wax, and Stalasso all prototypes for architectural structural skins, explore the generation of 3-D forms as they may be informed by loading\nconditions. Subterrain and Fatemaps are informed by heat; Tropisms and Raycounting explore the generation of form as it may be informed by light. The concluding and comprehensive experiments with\ndesign projects include Beast - a chaise lounge, the texture-form of which is informed by both loading\nand comfort constraints, and Carpal Skin a protective splint against carpal tunnel syndrome designed to\ncontrol muscular movement and provide comfort.\nFollowing the presentation of design experiments and projects, special focus is given to several key\nprojects implementing relevant “methodological frameworks” in the previous chapter. A tiling behavior\napproach is demonstrated in the design of Beast; the finite synthesis method is demonstrated in the\ndesign of Raycounting and Subterrain. Following this, all design experiments and projects are classified\naccording to the type of method and form-generation processes used.\n1.8\n\nNatural Fabrication: Variable Property Rapid Prototyping Technology\n\nChapter 8 is devoted to the development of a fabrication environment and technology designed to achieve\nvariable property fabrication. The objective is to enable the direct connection between material design\nand fabrication, or, in other words, the link between materiality and materialization.\nThe design experiments and products developed and implemented in Chapter 7, all share in common\nthe concept of gradual material variations informed by performance constraints. Instead of lower level\ncomponents put together into higher level assemblies, and made from homogeneous parts, all projects\nexemplify the notion of property variation through the implementation of ideas such as structural heterogeneity and controlled material distribution. These experiments were supported by the Material-based\nDesign Computation method and techniques allowing for the integration of material considerations as\npart of the form-generation process within the digital domain. However, all projects were eventually\nfabricated using existing rapid fabrication techniques.\nCurrently, in architectural design fabrication, there exists no rapid prototyping technology which allows\nfor a continuous modification of material properties such as strength, stiffness, density and elasticity as\ncontinuous gradients across the surface and volume area of a functional component. Such variations are\nusually achieved as discrete changes in physical behavior by printing multiple components with different\nproperties and distinct delineations between materials. In these cases, assembly typically begins only\nafter the fabrication process has been completed. Such processes result in material waste and lack of\nfunctional precision. Variable Property Rapid Prototyping aims at implementing a novel material deposition 3-D printing technology which offers gradation control of multiple materials within one print\nto save weight and material quantity while reducing energy inputs. The result is a continuous gradient\nmaterial structure, highly optimized to fit its structural performance with an efficient use of materials,\nreduction of waste and the production of highly customized features with added functionality. VPRP ultimately aims at significantly reducing material and energy waste in the design of products and buildings\nby constructing structures with varied properties using lighter, stronger materials and avoiding redundant\ndeposition. The aim is that such products will be designed to use significantly less fossil fuel energy to\nconstruct and operate than they would typically consume.\nThe chapter briefly reviews current state-of-the-art fabrication technologies and their environmental disadvantages. Unlike Nature’s way where high levels of environmental customization are achieved through\nproperty variation, contemporary design methods and products are characterized by material assemblies\nof homogeneous components. Current construction supports this logic.\nThe development of a new technology entitled variable property rapid prototyping (VPRP) is presented\nwhich allows the designer to print materials with varied properties (i.e. density, elasticity, etc). The\n\nNatural Fabrication 35\n\nultimate aim is to combine such fabrication technology with a variable property modeling environment\nwhereby computational units (“material pixels”) and physical fabrication units are calibrated with, and\naccording to, particular performance requirements (i.e. as is the case of bone).\nFollowing a short survey, the variable proper6ty fabrication software environment is presented, where\na color-coded control module represents the means by which to vary material properties continuously.\nHardware modules are reviewed: general technical descriptions are given to the various parts of the\nmachine. The chapter concludes with the technologys current limitations and future outlook towards a\nmore natural fabrication inspired by Nature’s way.\nFinally, it is suggested that the VPRP as a pilot project aims at revisiting design fabrication technologies\nas approximations to natural formation processes that take in unformed raw materials and operate on\nthem locally; using a single parameterized and digitally controlled process rather than many specialized\nprocesses, to produce formed solid objects. In this way, one is able to break free from the rigid logic of\nindustrial supply chains and related CAD systems.\n1.9\n\nContributions of Material-based Design Computation\n\nChapter 9 considers the theoretical, methodological and technical contributions of the thesis.\nTheoretical contributions refer to the development, definitions and implications of Material-based Design\nComputation as a design method, technique and fabrication technology prioritizing materials and environmental performance over a purely geometrical rendition of shape. Unlike current design processes\nwhere form dominates matter, design based upon the interrelation between materials and performance\npromotes the design of objects with graduated properties perfectly distributed and highly customized\nto fit their function. It is anticipated that such an approach will offer new possibilites for design and\npotentially enhance a new sensibility to sustainable design as we know it.\nMethodological contributions relate to the body of knowledge of Material-based Design Computation\nwhich aims at implementing the theoretical approach within a computational environment fostering\nmaterial-informed form generation processes. More specifically, methodological contributions refer to\nthe methods and technical means supporting this design approach through the introduction of design\nmethods and environments included under the categories of tiling behavior, finite element synthesis, and\nvariable property fabrication.\nThrough a series of design experiments, the thesis has demonstrated the integration of geometry, structure, and material not as separate elements of design, but rather as a multiplicity of design drivers acting\ntogether to generate form.\nBeyond the developments of scripts and programs to realize the collection of design work presented in\nthis thesis, technological contributions mainly refer to the development of a new fabrication technology\nentitled variable-property rapid prototyping enabling the distribution of material properties as continuous\ngradients within a 3-D printing environment.\nBoth variable property modeling and fabrication of materials with heterogeneous properties across a\nwide range of scales and applications holds a profound place in the future of design and engineering. The\nability to synthetically engineer and fabricate materials using VPRP strategies appears to be incredibly\npromising as it increases the product’s structural and environmental performance, enhances material\nefficiency, promotes material economy and optimizes material distribution. The fundamental technical\ncontribution is a first-generation rapid manufacturing tool for depositing material with gradually varying\nphysical properties such as density or elasticity per unit volume informed by structural and environmental\nfitness constraints.\nThe technical contributions of the thesis are summarized in Chapter 9 and include the analysis of forms\nallowing material property variation in response to mechanical, thermal, or lighting conditions; fabrica-\n\n36 NOTES ON THE SYNTHESIS OF MATERIAL FORM\n\ntion of forms with material property or thickness variation over a surface; and the development of a new\ndevice, the Variable Property Rapid Prototyping machine, for fabricating forms with varying material\nproperties and thickness.\nFollowing the main content of the chapter is an assessment of current limitations and future research.\nCertain fundamental question of “the origin of form” is re-addressed in the context of the design experiments presented. An important assumption underlying this research is that form may be generated\nwithout explicit a priori geometrical content, but rather as the byproduct of matching material parameters\nand environmental constraints. The main design model proposed in this thesis supports such a process\nby considering the landscape of design possibilities as the interaction between force and matter, and between energy and matter. Eco-maxels are conceived of as the units by which to technically achieve such\na new concept of design.\n\nFigures 37\n\nFigure 1.1: Orthocarpus Luteus (Yellow Owl’s Clover) photographed by Rob\nKesseler and Wolfgang Stuppy (Kesseler and Stuppy 2006). As demonstrated\nby the luteus, Nature’s Way (chapter 2) will unfold Nature’s form-generation\nstrategies characterized by achieving high levels of environmental customization. In Nature one finds complete integration between shape, structure and\nmaterial. Such integration, as we shall argue, is achieved by the assimilation\nbetween formal generation, adaptation and growth analogous to modeling,\nanalysis and fabrication in the design of the artificial.\n\n38 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nFigure 1.2: Laser-treated Polyamide.

Her challenges have been resolved over eons to enduring solutions\nwith maximal performance using minimal resources. Unsurprisingly, Nature’s inventions have eternally\ninspired human achievements and have led to the creation of exceedingly effective and efficient materials\nand structures, as well as methods, tools, mechanisms and systems by which to design them. Insights\ngained from the study of natural materials are significant, not only from a scientific perspective, but also\nin the context of their application to the design of synthetic environments.\nIn this chapter we review and discuss the main characteristics of Nature’s forms. This is a challenging\nmission when carried out from the point of view of design, since the phenomenon of growth alone\noccupies such vast implications in considering form’s origins: we are yet to grow a building. Despite\nthis, I aspire to examine Nature’s creations and to demonstrate that in Nature’s way there is always a direct\nrelation between matter and energy, between form and environment, and between organ and function.\nWhen considering natural forms and materials from a design perspective, it is therefore important to\nnote the strategies and mechanisms by which Nature goes about distributing materials and properties to\naccount for its functions as she maintains the forms of life on earth.\n\nWhy Nature? 41\n\n2.2\n\nSustainable by Nature: Principles\n\n2.2.1\n\nMinimum Inventory Maximum Diversity\n\nIn Structure in Nature Is a Strategy for Design Peter Pearce presents a concept by which he elucidated\nNature’s sustainable ways. He refers to this as the concept of Minimum Inventory - Maximum Diversity\n(Pearce 1981) which underlies every natural system. Such systems are defined by Pearce as minimized\ninventories of component types, a kit of parts, along with rules by which to combine these components.\nThe fit systems are those described by the contribution of their components to the maximization of\ndifferent, though generically related, structural forms. Furthermore, in successful systems the rules of\nassemblage and the physical components themselves are seen as organically related such that the rules\nare seen to grow out of the parts, and the parts grow out of the rules.\n\n2.2.1.1\n\nNatural Systems\n\nSnowflakes, for instance, exhibit great diversity of form, governed by certain physical, geometrical and\nchemical constraints. The snowflake is considered an archetype according to Pearce, of physio-geometric\nexpression: within the six-fold form no snowflakes have ever been known to be exactly alike. The case of\ncrystals is similar. Here one finds the expression of the diversity of form as a function of the least-energy\ninternal arrangement of atomic arrays.\n\n2.2.1.2\n\nBiological Systems\n\nIn biological structures, the DNA molecule suggests a minimum inventory-maximum diversity principle from a biomechanical interaction point of view (Pearce 1981). Natural materials are made from\na relatively small number of polymeric and ceramic components or building blocks, some of which are\nthemselves composites (Vincent 1982). The solid part of most plants for example is made up of cellulose,\nlignin and hemi-cellulose, while animal tissue is largely made of collagen, keratin, chitin and minerals\nsuch as calcite, hydroxyapetite and aragonite. From these, Nature fabricates a remarkable range of structured composites (Vogel 2003). In these cases, as in many others, a singular generic system constrained\nby its inventory promotes maximum diversity.\n\n2.2.2\n\nResource Conservation\n\nThe formative process in natural structures is typically characterized by least-energy responses. Such is\nthe principle of closest packing, a principle common to both the animate and inanimate world. Interestingly, the principle of closest packing is equivalent to that of triangulation, and it is a well known fact\nthat triangulated frameworks exhibit inherent geometric stability (Thompson 1942; Pearce 1981). Such\nproperties enable framework structures to be built without moment joints, insuring axially loaded members. This, in turn, results in high strength per weight minimum energy structures2.1 . Such a principle\nis of remarkable universality: it operates independently of scale or material with the same energetically\nconservative effect. Whether on the molecular level, the cellular level, or at the man-made structure level,\nits inherent stability always establishes a condition of minimum potential energy.\n2.1\n\nIn this context, consider Alexander Graham Bell’s tetrahedral kites and space frames.\n\n42 NATURE’S WAY\n\n2.2.3\n\nMinimum Energy\n\nNature creates forms and structures according to the requirements of minimum energy (Thompson 1942).\nShe does so as a response to the forces and loads as she creates a great diversity of forms from an\ninventory of basic principles and a few materials. Furthermore, Thomson claims that the form of an\nobject is analogous to the diagram of forces defining it. Such is a governing idea in the application of the\nminimum inventory-maximum diversity principle to building system design.\nBut, how are such principles implemented in the natural world from a materials perspective? There are\nmany ways by which to consider Nature’s material strategies. For the designer, there is particular interest\nin two of Nature’s many various traits which are defined in the following section.\n2.3\n2.3.1\n\nSustainable by Design: Strategies\nIntegrated Multi-criteria Environmental Performance: Load, Light, and the Seasons\n\nIn considering Natural material usage, it is challenging to distinguish between structure and skin, since so\nmany of Nature’s forms assimilate between varied functions and their related materials and properties.\nLook at your skin and you will quickly realize that within one continuous tissue we are constantly in\nnegotiation between seemingly contradictory functions as we consider the skin as both barrier and filter.\nIndeed, the skin has significant structural properties which allow it to fulfill its multiple functions. These\nfunctions include energy capture (i.e. insect compound eye), color generation (i.e. scales of butterfly\nwings), heat transfer (i.e. penguin feathers), mass transfer, drag reduction (i.e. shark skin), surface\nadhesion (i.e. contac splitting in gecko foot), surface repulsion, sensing, actuation, and so on. The one\ncommon denominator for all of these examples is that they are all constructed of complex fiber structures.\nIndeed, natural structures possess a high level of seamless integration and precision with which they serve\ntheir functions. A key distinguishing trait of nature’s designs is the capability in the biological world to\ngenerate complex fiber structures of organic, or inorganic, multifunctional composites such as shells,\npearls, corals, teeth, wood, silk, horn, collagen, and muscle fibers (Benyus,1997). Combined with extracellular matrices, these structural biomaterials form microstructures engineered to adapt to prearranged\nexternal constraints introduced into them during growth and/or throughout their life span (Vincent 1982).\nSuch constraints generally include combinations of structural, environmental and corporeal performance\ncriteria (Figure 2.1).\nSince many biological materials are made of fibers, their multi-functionality often occurs at scales that\nare nano through macro and typically achieved by mapping performance requirements to strategies of\nmaterial structuring and allocation. The shape of matter is therefore directly linked to the influences of\nforce acting upon it (Vogel 2003). Material is concentrated in regions of high strength and dispersed in\nareas where stiffness is not required. It is a well known fact that in nature shape is cheaper than material,\nyet material is cheap because it is effectively shaped and efficiently structured.\nNature’s ability to gradually distribute material properties by way of locally optimizing regions of varied\nexternal requirements, such as the bone’s ability to remodel under altering mechanical loads (Figures\n2.2, 2.3) or the wood’s capacity to modify its shape by way of containing moisture, is facilitated, fundamentally, by its ability to simultaneously model, simulate and fabricate material structuring.\nThe structural properties of wood, for instance, not unlike most biological materials, can widely vary\nwhen measured with the growth grain or against it such that its hardness and strength may differ for a\ngiven sample when measured in different orientations (Figure 2.4, 2.5)2.2 .\n2.2\nThis property is known as anisotropy and it is due to anisotropic structuring that nature can create sustainable structures\nefficiently. We shall return to explain this trait in depth in the following chapter along with relevant examples.\n\nSustainable by Design: Strategies 43\n\n2.3.2\n\nIntegrated Environmental Processes: Growth, Response, and Adaptation\n\nMillions of years devoted to the fine-tuning of the relation between structure and function have resulted in\nNature’s remarkable solutions to complex structural-mechanical problems (Weiner and Wagner 1998)2.3 .\nMoreover, natural material systems and structures are capable of changing their properties, shape, color,\nand load paths to account for varying structural and environmental constraints as well as to handle damage and promote repair. Their survival depends on Nature’s ability to negotiate between multiple functions and evaluate their relative significance within a singular process integrating the mechanisms of\ngrowth, response and adaptation.\nFurthermore, it turns out that rather than optimizing its resources for a single objective function, nature\nmust instead negotiate multiple functions by means of one single material system. The survival of such\nsystems depends on Nature’s ability to manage and promote the economic viability of her constructions,\nas well as satisfying a set of desired mechanical properties such as strength, stiffness, toughness and\nresistance to impact. In addition to form-generation and response through analysis, one of the most\nunique features of biological systems is their capability to diagnose and repair localized damage to their\nstructures. Clearly, such an attribute is desirable for man-made objects2.4 .\nIt is, however, important to state that natural processes of formal generation, analysis and fabrication\nare well integrated precisely because they can afford to be given the time-scales afforded by evolution.\nGordon notes that both shape and material of any natural structure have evolved over a long period of\ntime in a competitive world and represent an optimization with regard to the loads which it has to carry\nand to the financial, or the metabolic, cost (Gordon 1976). Still, it is our mission here to understand\nthe relationship between generation, analysis and fabrication as it is applied to the formation of natural\nspecimens in order that we might further speculate upon how such approaches may be implemented in\ndesign.\nIt is always thrilling to discover the extent of impact that the physical sciences had from the 1930’s\nonward on modernist designers who found inspiration in the life sciences; more fascinating however is\nthe acknowledgement of the converse condition in which the scope of impact that the design disciplines\nhad on protagonists of the natural sciences is well celebrated. Such was the case of natural inclination\nthat the ecologist Julian Huxley’s had towards Walter Gropius, the former Bauhaus director who at that\ntime fled Nazi Germany as he and fellow faculty relocated in London2.5 . Alongside Gropius was László\nMoholy-Nagy former head of the school’s metal workshop and renowned artist who, much like his\nfellow radical designers, who sought to unify the arts and the crafts with industrial universalism, found\nnew voices as well as patrons in a community of biologists in London who adapted Bauhaus architecture\nand art as part of their scientific vision for the future (Anker 2006)2.6 .\n2.3\n\nHere one has to bear in mind that despite evolution’s unconstrained timeframe, biological structures are not always perfectly\nadapted to their function. This is partly due to the fact that beyond the mechanical function of materials, some, if not all, of\nthem must fulfill other functions as well.\n2.4\nHowever, using energy to increase stiffness is not always the most “natural” solution. Nature uses strain energy as a\ndamage control mechanism by designing systems with large strain capabilities as compared to our modern constructs of steel,\nconcrete, and graphite. Adaptation of structural impedance is perhaps the most fundamental and powerful concept of intelligent\nmaterials systems. By modifying the structural impedance of a system, we can change its vibration and acoustic behavior as\nwell as change its resistance to damage.\n2.5\nJulian Huxley was then secretary of the Zoological Society of London. He had an apartment at the zoo, which he used\npartly as a showroom for modernist design. Here, scientists, artists, architects, environmentalists and the science-fiction writer\nH. G. Wells regularly met for discussions about how to save humankind from environmental, economic and social destruction\n(Anker 2006).\n2.6\nBauhaus design was one of the group’s chief passions, and Gropius looked to Huxley and his friends with hope and\nadmiration. Traditional architecture and design reinforced an unfortunate dualism between people and nature, Huxley believed,\nwhereas the Bauhaus approach promised a harmonious reunion. To Huxley, nothing less than the evolutionary survival of the\n\n44 NATURE’S WAY\n\n2.4\n2.4.1\n\nInspired by Nature: Related Fields and Approaches\nBiotechnik\n\nIn this circumstance Moholy-Nagy found a major source of inspiration in Raoul Francé. Francé is known\nto have founded the science of bionics with the motivation and claim that humans must learn how to\ncopy Nature’s inventions in order to survive on earth. This new science was first named Biotechnik ’bio-technique’ (Anker 2006).\nMoholy-Nagy’s students and fellow designers were instructed by him to view Nature as a “constructional\nmodel” and to search for “prototypes in nature” in order to better determine functional design. He proposed that all human technologies are based in natural technologies. Moholy-Nagy himself studied the\nworks of Huxley and his colleagues and used it to generate his own principles, techniques and processes\nas they might be applied to human design. His 1935 film In the Cradle of the Deep documents the growth\nof lobsters and the fisherman’s struggle to search them out. He argued that a “prehistoric animal shell\nis constructed in such a wonderful way that we could immediately adapt it to a fine Bakelite2.7 or other\nmolded plastic form”. The point of the film was to show designers that observing the life of animals may\nwell instruct designers how form follows function. Furthermore, Nagy’s investigations into architecture\nand photography were also informed by the life sciences. He defined architecture “as an organic component of living” and argued that “architecture will be brought to its fullest realization only when the\ndeepest knowledge of human life in the biological whole is available” (Anker 2006).\n2.4.2\n\nBiomimetics\n\nWith respect to this underlying motivation to translate natural, and particularly, growth, processes into\ndesign principles, Biomimetics is an emerging field the objective of which is to study design solutions to\nproblems in the natural world as potentially relevant to contemporary design and engineering. According\nto Klein, B.M. Katz has defined the field as the study of natural processes and how they can be emulated to\nsolve human problems in a life-friendly, waste-free way (Klein 2009). There it is stated that in contrast to\ngenetic engineering which turns cellular organisms into factories for industrial production, biomimetics\ntries to turn society’s productive resources into agents of nature. The natural world is treated as a library\nof ideas. J.F. Vincent, one of a small number of acknowledged experts in the field, defines it simply as,\n“the abstraction of good design from nature” (Vincent 1990). Although this sounds obvious, in fact, it\ninvolves much more complex intellectual and research-related processes.\nAlthough the field of Biomimimetics can be traced to Leonardo da Vinci’s work, it is considered to\nhave been formulated in 1991 when the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research convened a group\nof researchers to consider the way in which nature produces and processes unique materials. Thus\nthe original motivation was to achieve inspiration from natural materials and processes as a source of\npotential innovations in materials design that might be turned into practical applications. The field is\nalso known by the term, bionics, as the copying of natural designs. The reference to bionics is also\nattributed to the US Air Force, but dated by Julian Vincent to the 1950’s.\nDespite the fact that the evolutionary time-frame of millions of years is of a completely different range\nof scales from that of contemporary engineering, product design, materials design and architecture, it\nwas considered that the design objectives of these fields were often similar to those which underlies the\nevolutionary processes of nature. Among these are functionality, optimization, energy efficiency and costeffectiveness. We now can study how nature has optimized the architecture of materials over the long\nhuman species was at stake (Anker 2006).\n2.7\nBakelite is an early plastic; a thermosetting phenol formaldehyde resin, formed from an elimination reaction of phenol\nwith formaldehyde, usually with a wood flour filler. It was developed in 19071909 by Belgian chemist Dr. Leo Baekeland.\n\nInspired by Nature: Related Fields and Approaches 45\n\nperiod of natural evolution. All of these factors are common to contemporary design and engineering\nfields. In studying how nature achieves optimization we concentrate on materials, structural properties,\nmechanical properties, functional integration, sensing and control systems, and other aspects of design\nthat have general relevance for contemporary inventions and solutions.\nIn nature there is little emphasis on esoteric, or “expensive” materials. There are few chemical substances\nused in animal life, and they are generally constructed using relatively low-performance materials. Success from a design point of view depends not on what they are made of, but rather in how they are made.\nStructure rather than energy, is the general design principle of nature. It has been said that in nature,\n‘shape is cheaper than material’, therefore we have much to learn from nature regarding effective and\ninnovative approaches to the design parameters described above.\nOne of the classic studies which may be considered as among the foundations of the field is the work of\nD’Arcy Thompson, the Scottish naturalist and mathematician, who published the results of his research\non natural forms in the influential work, On Growth and Form of 1917. Here, for one of the first occasions in human history, living things are treated as examples of the solution of engineering problems\n(Thompson 1942).\n2.4.3\n\nBiogenesis: Towards Natural Design\n\nIn this thesis we consider new approaches to form-generation inspired by nature from a materials perspective. The first serious engineering approach to the subject was made by A. G. M. Michell around\n1900 in a publication entitled The limits of economy of material in frame-structures (Michell 1904). After that, On Growth and Form was the first general account of the influence of structural requirements on\nthe shapes of plants and animals (Thompson 1942).\nOther designers and engineers have further developed the fascination with biology and living nature in\nthe context of form-finding. Among them were Frei Otto and his group at the Institute for Lightweight\nStructures at the University of Stuttgart during the 1970’s. In a series of publications from that period, specifically IL-6 which marks the tenth year anniversary of the institute, Otto delivers an honest\ndeclaration about such associations and the productivity which they inspire: “Every material object has\nthe ability of conveying forces. We are studying the capability to convey forces independent of form,\nmaterial, and type of load... in all objects of organic and inorganic matter” (Otto, Trostel et al. 1973,\np.5).\nIn this chapter we review structure-mechanical relations at various hierarchical levels of organization,\nhighlighting wherever possible meaningful avenues in the generation and structuring of synthetic form.\n2.5\n\nNature’s Design Strategy: Structural Heterogeneity through Material Distribution\n\nWhen compared to manmade fabricated materials, many natural materials, particularly in the plant kingdom, mechanically outperform some of the most common materials used by engineers and architects.\nWoods have strength per unit weight comparable with that of the strongest steels); shell, bone, and antler\nhave toughness an order of magnitude greater than engineering ceramics; and mature bamboo stalks have\nslenderness ratios which are remarkable even by the standards of modern engineering (Ashby 1995). Yet\nNature’s materials are less than half as dense as many of these artificial materials and are characterized\nby very low weight and are functional for the plant to sustain2.8 (Niklas 1992). What are the attributes\nthat make natural materials so effective? In his Plant Biomechanics: An Engineering Approach to Plant\nForm and Function, Niklas determines that organisms live by the laws of physics and chemistry and as\n2.8\nSince vertical construction carries with it the design constraint of self-loading, in addition to being strong, materials should\nbe light. In fact, for its density, cellulose is the strongest material known (Niklas, 1992).\n\n46 NATURE’S WAY\n\nsuch they have evolved and adapted to mechanical forces in a manner consistent with the limits set by the\nmechanical properties of their materials (Niklas 1992). Furthermore, in the plant world particularly it is\noften the case that material properties influence the plant’s mechanical behavior2.9 . Niklas demonstrates\nthat the nutshell of the macadamia is as hard as annealed, commercial grade aluminum, resists twice\nthe force necessary to fracture metals of various types, and is stronger than silicate glasses, concrete,\nporcelain, and domestic brick.\nBiological materials are indeed very versatile: they can change their material properties to fit the age or\nthe function of their immediate physiological condition2.10 . Hence the mechanical behavior of any single\nbiological material is defined by multiple properties, not all of which can be maximized. Each material\nis used according to its particular qualities and the types and magnitudes of the mechanical forces it must\nsustain.\nIn The Mechanical Properties of Natural Materials, Gibson explores various classes of natural materials\nas she examines the relation between their composite and cellular microstructures and their exceptionally\nhigh values of mechanical performance (Gibson 1995). The function of these natural materials exploits\ntheir exceptional structural properties: woods and palms resist bending and buckling, silk stores elastic\nstrain energy, muscle stores and releases elastic strain energy during locomotion, and so on. Such relations have significant implications for the design of mechanically efficient engineering materials: when\nconsidering beams and plates of a given stiffness or strength, or columns of a given buckling resistance,\nwoods, palms and bamboo are among the most efficient materials available (Gibson 1995). Gibson\nreviews four classes of natural materials: woods, palm and bamboo, stems and quills. The results of\nthe analyses suggest novel microstructures for mechanically efficient engineering materials for bending\nstiffness and elastic buckling resistance achieved by optimizing micro-structural organization to fit performance requirements such that the cellular structure can enhance performance for loading parallel to\nthe grain (Gibson 1995). Common to all these examples are the exceptional properties of natural materials arising mainly through novel microstructures for efficient engineering materials (Figure 2.6, 2.7).\nNature’s building blocks are therefore not as unique as their structuring in that it is not so much the material properties of the components as their arrangement within the natural composites which give rise\nto such a vast range of properties. Thus we may postulate that Material Structure is an important design\nproperty of natural design as well as a significant body of design knowledge.\n2.6\n2.6.1\n\nCase Study 1 (Cellular Solids): Structural Heterogeneity in Bones\nMacro (System) Scale: The Forces of Human Locomotion\n\nIn an inspiring essay, Benno Kummer discusses the work of the anatomist Von Meyer and the technician\nCulmann to comprehend bone matter as a system incorporating material and morphology as they are\ninformed by structural performance (Otto, Herzog et al. 1990). The material, structure, and form of\nbone are all interrelated in its formation and behavior. Matter is distributed to fit stress paths in micro\nand macro scale such that the structural characteristics follow the behavior of the elements and fit their\nproperties.\nThe basic building block of the bone family of materials is the mineralized collagen fibril. It is composed\nof the fibrous protein collagen in a structural form that is also present in skin, tendon, and a variety of\n2.9\n\nGiven that the plant world is devoid of nervous systems, observations and examinations carried out regarding the relation\nbetween material properties and mechanical function are easily established.\n2.10\nThe responsiveness of plants to their immediate mechanical environment was recognized by botanists as early as the midnineteenth century when it was first discovered that young plant cell walls are ductile, while older cell walls tend to be much\nmore elastic and resilient (Niklas, 1992).\n\nCase Study 1 (Cellular Solids): Structural Heterogeneity in Bones 47\n\nother soft tissues. The collagen constitutes the main component of a three-dimensional matrix into which,\nand in some cases onto which, the mineral forms (Weiner and Wagner 1998).\nThe manner in which the building blocks are organized into higher order structures can also vary, and in\nfact, this is the basis for differentiating between the members of the bone family of biological materials.\nFurthermore, some such materials are composed of two or three different organizational structures such\nthat the whole structure may be folded into even larger superstructures. The range of their orders and\nproperties reflects many different variables: the diversity in structures, the orientation of the specimens,\nthe variations in mineralization extent and porosity, the precise locations of the specimens, and so on.\nThus the structures of these materials must be understood both in terms of the differences between family\nmembers, and most importantly according to hierarchical levels of organization (Weiner and Wagner\n1998).\nUnderstanding structure-function relations in these materials is therefore a challenge. The understanding\nof this subject requires sorting out the bulk mechanical behavior in terms of the contributions of the\nsub-structures at each hierarchical level. However, since many of these materials change their structure\nin time, and in turn affect the mechanical properties of the tissue2.11 .\nFurthermore, specialized bone cells actively remove older bone and replace it with younger bone, which\nmay even have a slightly different structure such that it is presumably optimized to function in the prevailing stress field at the time of its formation Weiner, S. and H. Wagner (1998). “The material bone:\nstructure-mechanical function relations.” This would still not be a valid analysis. Weiner and Wagner have chosen to organize their review according to the hierarchical levels of organization (Figure 2.8).\nThey discuss 5 of the 7 hierarchical levels, which range in scale from nanometers to millimeters, in terms\nof their structures and mechanical properties (Weiner and Addadi 1997; Weiner and Wagner 1998).\n\n2.6.2\n\nMeso (Structure) Scale: Structure-Function Relations in 7 Hierarchical Levels of\nOrganization\n\n2.6.3\n\nMicro (Material) Scale\n\nThe structure of skeletal elements is not the only feature which is adapted to the type of mechanical\nstrain. This applies to the same extent for the density distribution of the bony material providing the\nmechanical strength. Today it is generally accepted that the density and anisotropy of cancellous bone\ndepends on the magnitude and direction of the loads it experiences (Gibson 1984; Ashby 1995; Gibson\nand Ashby 1997).\nKummer and his fellow scientists at the institute devised graphical techniques, such as the Material\nMountain Ranges (Figure 2.9), to quantify material distribution of bony matter as it relates to the distribution of strain, and assisted in the understanding that both the structure and the distribution of material\nin bone is adapted to the type and magnitude of mechanical strain. Cancellous bone has a cellular structure, and is considered to incorporate similar mechanical properties and structural behavior characteristic\nof the family of cellular solids (Gibson 1984; Ashby 1995; Gibson and Ashby 1997). Furthermore, it is\nprobably one of the more classical examples for a system which organizes matter consistent with stress\npatterns across scales of both material and structure, a distinction that is at times vague and difficult to\nmake.\n2.11\n\nSome of these changes are in part thermodynamically driven, such as the increase in the sizes of the crystals, and some\nare also biologically mediated, such as the determination of the average proportions of collagen, mineral, and water in a given\nmaterial.\n\n48 NATURE’S WAY\n\n2.7\n\nCase Study 2 (Fiber Structures): Structural Heterogeneity in Trees\n\nI have spent many hours gazing at trees. Beyond their extraordinary beauty, trees are the perfect example\nof systems which have been shaped by the forces of nature and as such, they represent Nature’s strategies\nin regards to the growth, generation, adaptation and preservation of form.\nNatural systems are shaped by, and exposed to the elements surrounding them. The range of loads\nto which a tree is exposed is vast and it includes forces of various magnitudes and directions, bending\nmoments, torsional moments, and thermal stresses amongst others. If the tree is to resist the loads exerted\nupon it, these loads must be countered by a support applying equally large, but opposed, reaction loads\nagainst it.\nIn the engineering disciplines it is often the case that such force-form relations are simplified and abstracted as post beam models in order to predict physical deformation. However, Nature’s strategies\nmust not be merely reduced to geometrical abstraction, for in Nature the distribution of material substance relative to its guiding and shaping forces is as significant to the tree’s structural stability as is its\nform itself. All in all, the case of the tree provides for a good starting point by which to understand the\nforces of Nature.\n2.7.1\n2.7.1.1\n\nMacro (System) Scale: The Forces of Nature\nAxial Forces\n\nAxial forces are the most basic example. The mass of a tree’s branches exerts (by its very own weight)\nan axial force on its trunk, thus causing compressive stress. The branches cause an elastic compression\nof the trunk in the axial direction resulting in a spatially uniform distribution of compressive stresses\n(Mattheck 1998). The soil below the tree’s trunk must therefore exert an equally great but opposite force\nin order to avoid the hypothetical condition in which the post sinks into the soil. As a reaction, axial\ntensile forces would cause tensile stresses in the post. The situation is rather more complicated with\neccentric loading.\n2.7.1.2\n\nEccentric Loading\n\nWhen dissecting a trunk horizontally, it is rather easy to trace the relative location of branches by establishing areas in the section more or less denser with tissue. In the case of eccentric loading, a uniform\nbending moment may be acting downwards in the entire trunk, compensated by the ground via the roots.\nNaturally, the bending moment in the side branch will cause much higher bending stresses than in the\ntrunk. In this case, it may become quite apparent that in the central axis within the trunk and the branch\nneither tensile nor compressive stresses are present. Despite not being fully loaded, this zone within the\ntree constrains wood capable of bearing load. Furthermore, it is otherwise quite ineffective with regards\nto bending and thus rather wasteful from a materials perspective.\nNature tolerates this deficiency in a tree motionless and anchored in the soil. However in a mobile\nmammal one finds various bones that are hollow in the zones where fibers sustain neutral bending. In\nthe animal kingdom it is thus the case that no material is placed where there is nothing to carry: in such\nregions bones are shaped simply as hollow tubes.\n2.7.1.3\n\nLateral Loading\n\nThe tree arranges its material sensibly within the narrower limits of its possibilities: trees loaded laterally on one side by wind become elliptical in the wind direction. Thus, if the tree now deposits all its\n\nCase Study 2 (Fiber Structures): Structural Heterogeneity in Trees 49\n\nbuilding materials in the zone of highest bending stress (tension side and compression side) by forming\nparticularly wide annual rings there, this buildup goes into the third power of the large axis (the longitudinal axis describing the trunk), while a widening in the direction of the small axis is only linear. The\ntree thus forms a non-circular cross-section which is stiffest against the prevailing bending load, and is\ncharacterized by smaller stresses than a uniformly circular cross-section with an identical external bending moment. Root cross-sections may even assume nearly the shape of an I-beam, in which hardly any\nwood forms in the zone of neutral bending. Here the component is forced into an optimization of shape\n(Mattheck 1998).\n2.7.1.4\n\nComposite Loading\n\nBesides tensile and compressive stresses resulting from axial tension or compression and the bending\nstresses (transition from tensile to compressive stresses with a defined spatial, usually linear, distribution)\nthere are also the shear stresses. These are stresses acting tangentially in the shear-loaded plane, and\nprevent the bodies separated by it from sliding on each other. They are therefore qualitatively very\ndifferent from the tension and bending stresses acting perpendicularly to a given reference plane. The\ntorsion load causes, for example, a shear stress distribution in the cross-sectional plane of the twisted\ncylinder illustrated, which increases linearly from the center.\nIn our tree, a one-sided crown shape, with one branch extending far towards the light, could lead to a\ntwisting of the trunk under wind pressure and cause the same shear stresses in the trunk. Each instance\nof loading is made up of a large composition of loading cases. Naturally, loading conditions are usually\nmulti-axial and different stresses act in different directions.\n2.7.2\n2.7.2.1\n\nMeso (Structure) Scale: Shape Adaptation in Fibrous Systems\nTension and Compression Wood\n\nReaction wood, also known by its scientific term gravitropism, is abnormal wood found in the trunks\nand branches of leaning trees resulting in abnormal rings wider on one side than the other. It is formed\nby the tree’s response to directional stress and its attempt to counteract it. In hardwoods, reaction wood\nis also known as tension wood as it forms on the upper side of the lean. In softwoods, reaction wood is\nknown as compression wood forms on the lower side of the leaning tree (Figure 2.10).\nAlthough compression wood has a higher than-normal density, it is weak in some critical strength properties. The most serious drawback of compression wood is its abnormal drying behavior. When normal\nwood in the form of lumber dries, it shrinks in thickness and width (by predictable amounts). It shrinks\nvery little (practically negligible) in length. Compression wood, however, shrinks in length by more than\n10 times that of normal wood. This causes bowing and twisting of certain pieces of lumber.\n2.7.2.2\n\nMaterial Distribution through Optimization\n\nReaction wood is an interesting case of material formation informed by mechanical environmental stimuli that are external to the tree’s genotype. In this sense, any material optimization processes occurring to\ncounteract directional stress are relative to the tree’s particular loading case. The tree’s capacity to adapt\nitself to these external conditions is essential under conditions of uncertainty as far as future loading\ncases are considered.\nMaterial optimization occurs as fiber structures within the woody tissue compute stimuli of morphomechanical nature and translate it into a process known as transduction, characterized by the movement\n\n50 NATURE’S WAY\n\nof starch grains within the plant cell corresponding to the direction and magnitude of the load. A signaling regulation mechanism follows preceding the mechanical response. Shape adaptation is naturally\ndependant on the offset angle from the vertical axis as fiber reorientation emerges in time.\n2.7.2.3\n\nHierarchical Levels of Shape Adaptation\n\nThe basic mechanism for shape-change in plants is based on the restructuring of fiber structures in\nmultiple scales. Shape adaptation, characterized by incremental changes in curvature, occurs as nonsymmetric tree laminates respond to external load forming compression and tension wood in the top and\nbottom areas of the tissue respectively. Local structural changes thus affect global curvature (Figure 2.11,\n2.12).\nThree hierarchical levels of shape adaptation may be observed as mechanical reorientation occurs on the\ncell walls (local level), the tissue (regional level) and the trunk (global level). In this case, geometrical\nmanipulation is dependent on growth, deposition and reorientation of fiber structures.\n2.7.3\n\nMicro (Material) Scale\n\nTracheids in softwoods and fibers in hardwoods, for instance, provide the mechanical support for the tree.\nGibson has idealized the cellular structure by modeling only the tracheids, or fibers, as a honeycomb. The\nmodels suggest the complexity of fiber orientation as larger numbers of fibers orient themselves more\nnearly, parallel to the axis of the cell than normal to it (Gibson 1995). Given the layup, the Young’s\nmodulus for the cell wall can be calculated from composite theory.\nAnother striking feature illustrated by Gibson are the relatively dense, fiber-like vascular bundles distributed throughout a “matrix” of parenchyma cells that make up the bulk of most non-woody structures.\nLongitudinal sections reveal fiber alignment relative to mechanical function. Some tissues on the other\nhand, such as palm stems have a non-uniform radial distribution of vascular bundles, with more bundles\nof larger diameter at the periphery than at the center. Unlike wood, palm lacks a cambium through which\nradial growth can occur to provide support with increasing height. Instead, palm stems rely largely on\nincreasing the thickness and degree of lignifications of older cell walls leading to radial and longitudinal gradients in tissue density. The stem of bamboo has a radially varying volume fraction of “fibers”,\nincreasing its flexural rigidity (Gibson 1995). Plant stems resist both axial load (from their own mass)\nand bending moment (from wind loads): structurally, they act as beam-columns. Plant stems are axissymmetric: their cylindrical tubes are able to resist wind blowing form any direction equally. Local\nbuckling is accounted for by internal pressurization of the stem and support of a dense stiff outer shell\nby an elastic foundation of foam-like material (Gibson 1995).\nMore specifically, wood consists of cellulose fibers in a lignin, hemicellulose matrix, shaped to hollow\nprismatic cells. Skin, tendon and cartilage are all largely collagenous composites: in skin, the collagen is\nsandwiched between a basement membrane and an overlying keratinized epidermis; in tendon, the collagen fibers are aligned to form rope-like structures which make up most of the volume; and in cartilage,\nthe collagen fibers are in a proteoglycan matrix with a small volume fraction of elastin fibers. Hair, nail,\nhorn, wool, reptilian scales and hooves are made of keratin while insect cuticle is largely chitin. Bone,\nshell and antler are composites of calcite, hydroxyapatite or aragonite platelets dispersed in a helical\nmatrix of collagen (Vogel 2003).\n\nCase Study 2 (Fiber Structures): Structural Heterogeneity in Trees 51\n\n2.8\n\nThe Advantages of Material Distribution over Material Assembly\n\nFibers can be seen everywhere in Nature, and across multiple scales. Like engineering materials, natural\nmaterials can also be grouped into classes the common denominator of which is that all natural materials\nare made of fibers. They include: (1) Natural ceramic and ceramic composites include bone, shell,\ncoral, antler, enamel and dentine. All are made up of ceramic particles such as hydroxyapatite, calcite\nor aragonite in a matrix of collagen; (2) Natural polymers and polymer composites include cellulose,\nchitin, silk, cuticle, collagen, keratin and tendon; (3) Natural elastomers such as skin, muscle, cartilage,\nartery, abduction, resilin, and elastin; (4) Natural cellular materials such as wood, cancellous bone, palm\nand cork all have low densities because of the high volume fractions of voids they contain. They are\nalmost always anisotropic because of the shape and orientation of the cells and of the fibers they contain;\nthe prismatic cells of wood, for instance, give a much greater stiffness and strength along the grain than\nacross it.\nFibrous composite structures in nature are used mainly for three functions: (1) to introduce and exploit\nheterogeneity and anisotropy (locally and globally); (2) to modulate the tissue’s physical properties; and,\n(3) to create functional architectures and shapes through structural hierarchies. All three functions are\nclearly interrelated.\nNature’s capacity to structure its material organizations in a variety of different ways by which to efficiently and effectively correspond to multiple functions has various advantages in the natural world.\nThey include (1) anisotropy, (2) heterogeneity and, (3) hierarchical structuring.\n2.8.1\n\nAnisotropy\n\nAnisotropy is the property of being directionally dependent. It implies the heterogeneity of physical\nand mechanical properties relative to their functions. Anisotropy can be defined as a difference, when\nmeasured along different axes, in a material’s physical property (absorbance, refractive index, density,\netc.) Wood, as previously demonstrated, is a naturally anisotropic material. Its properties vary widely\nwhen measured with the growth grain or against it. For example, wood’s strength and hardness will\nbe different for the same sample if measured in differing orientation. The advantage in controlling\nthe directionality of physical and mechanical properties results in highly efficient structures and forms\ncustomized to their environment and tailored to support the range of constraints introduced to them by\ntheir immediate environment.\n2.8.2\n\nHeterogeneity\n\nHeterogeneity allows for the generation of position-dependent material properties. It is here considered as higher-level anisotropies accounting for non-homogeneous distribution of fibers with multiple\ndirections (Figures 2.13, 2.14).\n2.8.3\n\nHierarchical Structuring\n\nThe emergence of hierarchical structures in natural tissues and specimens is promoted by anisotropic\nmaterial structuring resulting in heterogeneous organizations that, when superimposed, enhance the mechanical performance of the substrate. Bottom-up assemblies of structures and interfaces appear as\nmultiple material organizations form super-structures in meso-, and macro-scales.\n\n52 NATURE’S WAY\n\n2.9\n\nNatural Dichotomies on the Way to Design by Material Distribution\n\nThe distinction between materials and structures in the context of design is not a trivial one. It exists as a\nfigure of measure related to scales of function and behavior. When we give scale to an object it acquires\nnew meaning and gives meaning back to its environment. In this sense, scale allows us to go beyond\nformal representations which remain otherwise abstract in category: With scale comes a commitment to\nphysics.\nIn his seminal essay On Magnitude, D’Arcy Thompson argues that any conception of form must be\nreferred to in terms of magnitude and direction, “for the effect of scale depends not on a thing in itself but\nin relation to its whole environment or milieu” (Thompson 1952). Hence any manifestation of form must\nbe examined not as mere representation but rather (and quite literally) as an entity embedded within its\nsurroundings - whether physical or programmatic. Since we will be dealing with design artifacts which\nare physical in nature, the difference between “material” and “structure” is fundamental to the logic of\nmaterial organization that is informed by performance.\nIn dealing with biology from an engineering point of view, Julian Vincent states that wood or leaf have\nobvious “structure” yet are mostly treated as materials. The resolution to this problem, according to\nVincent, generally lies in behavior2.12 : when dealing with a material, then it will have the same stiffness\nin tension, bending and compression in all directions. If it doesn’t it is structure we’re dealing with the\nstiffness which is being measured is not a material parameter (Vincent 1982). Materials are typically\nclassified by charted properties such as strength, density, toughness, elongation, electrical resistively and\nenergy content whereas structures are typically classified by behavior (Gordon 1976). For instance some\nstructures are good for compressive loads (shells, frame structures) whereas others are good for tension\nloads (membranes, cable structures, etc.).\n2.9.1\n\nThe Dichotomy between Shape and Size\n\nShape and size are of (traditional) concerns to the comparative and functional morphologist since they\nintrinsically define material form resulting from self-loading. The relation between shape and size is such\nthat the size of an organism dictates the weight that must be sustained, while the shape of the organism\ndefines the cross-sectional areas through which weight operates. Similarly, the spatial distribution of\nmaterials within an object which translates into the anatomy of a biological structure, defines the local\nstrains resulting from a given load. Shape and size thus influence the relative magnitudes of stresses that\ndevelop within structural support members such as plant stems and tubular leaves. The importance of\nshape and size to biomechanics is self-evident when we consider engineering parameters called moments\nof area, which are mathematical descriptions of the spatial distribution of material within an object\n(Niklas 1992).\nFurthermore, of the characteristics of organisms, only that of shape approaches size in terms of its variability; and shape proves far harder to reduce to one or a few numerical specifications. It has been a\nsubliminal presence so far much avoided! Most of the slop in the data behind the scaling exponents\ncomes probably from shape variability. How to deal with shape in our search for general rules of biological organization and operation? Some shape descriptions that have proven useful are: center of gravity\n(or, center of mass), moments of area, center of buoyancy (center of volume), fractal dimension, flatness\nindex.\n\n2.12\n\nThere are also exceptions: single crystals can be anisotropic.\n\nNatural Dichotomies on the Way to Design by Material Distribution 53\n\n2.9.2\n\nThe Dichotomy between Structure and Material\n\nGiven that cost-effective and durable structures are the result of constraint negotiations carried over\nmillennia, biological materials do not typically distinguish between material and structure (Rogers 1993).\nFurthermore, in Nature, the distinction between intelligent material systems and intelligent structures is\nbasically irrelevant. Indeed, it may only be applied superficially in terms of the scale of a material’s\nmicrostructure which governs its behavior, regardless of its size (Rogers 1993).\nHowever, such distinction between structure and material has been repeatedly emphasized because the\nmechanical behavior of a structure can be understood only when its geometry and the material properties\nof its constituent solids or fluids are considered together. For instance, the geometry of the cell wall\ninfrastructure within a plant tissue may in some cases supersede in importance the material properties of\nthe infrastructure. Thus we can never disassociate the mechanical behavior of a tissue from it anatomical\nconfiguration (Niklas 1992).\nThe term bone refers to a family of materials, all of which are built up of mineralized collagen fibrils.\nThey have highly complex structures, described in terms of up to 7 hierarchical levels of organization.\nThese materials have evolved to fulfill a variety of mechanical functions, for which the structures are\npresumably fine-tuned. Matching structure to function is a challenge (Weiner and Wagner 1998).\n2.9.3\n\nThe Dichotomy between Size and Scale\n\nOrganisms occupy an extensive size range in Nature of about a hundred million fold2.13 : from the tiniest\nbacteria of about 0.3 micrometers long (a hundred thousandth of an inch) to whales of about 30 meters\n(110 feet) long. Vogel determines that when determining how size affects biological design, nothing is\nmore significant than the relationship between surface area and volume (Vogel 2003). This is mainly due\nto the fact that any contact between an organism and its surroundings are a function of its surface, while\nits internal processes and structure depend predominantly on its volume2.14 . However, in Nature, surface\narea and volume do not maintain a simple proportionality. In other words, one cannot simultaneously\ndouble both the surface area and the volume of a body without changing its shape2.15 (Vogel 2003).\nIn other words, an organism’s shape determines the environmentally and functionally significant ratio\nbetween surface areas to volume.\nOperational scales in biological systems have evolved to match natural scales and hierarchies of scales\nare often repeated in Nature. In a variety of mature adult lamellar bone2.16 for instance, the interconnected bars known as trabeculae, and plates of bony tissue, are resized and reshaped by osteoclasts\n(bone-destroying cells) and osteoblasts (bone-forming cells). At the micrometer scale, there is a ‘plywood’ structure of layers (lamellae) of about 3 m bundles of collagen fibers. Bone salt crystals (impure\ncarbonate apatite) fill much of the water space in the collagenous matrix as they form the bone’s hierarchical structures. Similarly, when examined from the naked eye to the atomic force microscope, a piece\nof steel or ceramic will show a hierarchy of natural scales. In order of increasing magnification they\ninclude the sensed surface roughness, the observed grain structures with dislocations and inclusions of\nother phases, the space-charge regions or atmospheres of impurities around dislocations or segregated to\ninterfaces, and, finally, atomic structures come into view. Mesoscopic features are those with characteristic scales between the atomic and macroscopic, and are crucial in how materials perform (Stoneham\n2.13\nThe indicated range is equivalent to 8 orders of magnitude. When compared to the building industry one might consider a\nrange equal to only 3 orders of magnitude from sand grain to brick.\n2.14\nThis is mostly true for buildings too.\n2.15\nHere it is relevant to note that surfaces are proportional to the square of lengths; volumes are proportional to the cubes of\nlengths.\n2.16\nAlso known as spongy (cancellous or trabeculae) bone.\n\n54 NATURE’S WAY\n\nand Harding 2009).\nThis idea of an appropriate scale for a given system and property emerges repeatedly in natural systems. Furthermore, there might be several such scales, depending on the property. For a tree trunk, the\nappropriate scale for strength differs from the appropriate scale for water transport. For photochromic\nsunglasses, the scale for metal colloids contributing to darkening is much less than that for mechanical\nrobustness. Identifying the right operational scales is a first step on the way to optimizing mesostructures\nby guiding a system to adopt the right scale.\n2.10\n\nSummary\n\nBiological materials display exquisite hierarchical structural control designed for specific loading conditions, including the recurrent use of fundamental constituents, controlled crystallography, anisotropies\nand/or isotropy, orientation of structural elements, gradients, durable mechanically interlocking interfaces between dissimilar materials (compliant/ductile and rigid/hard), complex shapes/geometries, porosity, etc. (Vincent 1982; Wainwright 1982; Weiner and Addadi 1997; Weiner and Wagner 1998; Currey\n2005; Ortiz and Boyce 2008)\nThe fundamental constituents of biological materials typically exhibit weak macro-scale mechanical\nproperties (brittle biological ceramics and compliant macromolecules), and yet, they are able to achieve\norders-of-magnitude increases in strength and toughness; this “mechanical property amplification” occurs in a non-additive manner that goes beyond the simple composite rule of mixture formulations (Wegst\nand Ashby 2004; Ortiz and Boyce 2008.\nIn this chapter I have chosen to focus on the structure-property relationships of co-continuous meso-scale\ncomposite microstructures inspired from designs observed in biology. We have seen that many natural\nsystems assemble multiple layers of different porous microstructures together as they form higher order\ngeometrical shapes culminating in macro-scale hierarchical designs that work together with the inherent\nmaterial properties to achieve the required biomechanical function. In particular, we have focused on\nthe strategies devised by Nature to promote heterogeneity and distribution at the material level (through\nanisotropy, heterogeneity and hierarchies), at the structure level (through shape adaptation along with\ndimensional and topological changes) and finally, at the system level (through emergent behavior and\nadaptation). We have also learned that such distinguishing traits between “material” and “structure” are\nat times quite elusive.\nThe design implications of the structuring of difference, or structural heterogeneity achieved through the\ninformed distribution of fibers, holds significant implications from a design standpoint. Fiber structure\norientation allows for an almost unlimited design space in terms of geometrical and topological variation, it promotes high levels of functional integration through the assignment of graduated properties,\nit supports the matching between material property distribution and continuous load paths, it allows the\ndesigner to consider the possibility of adaptive response, along with potential unlimited explorations of\noptimization strategies for robustness and a relatively easy integration of sensing functions.\nAs we have seen in previous examples as well as the detailed case studies into bones and trees, fibers\nrepresent physical line elements providing paths for transmitting, transferring and diffusing mechanical\nand chemical information into structures. Groups of fibres can be organised in one-, two-, and threedimensions to create physical equivalents of lines, surfaces and solids such as those obtainable from\ntextile technologies (which preserve fibre mobility) or composite technologies (where the fibrous networks are rigidified by bonding together fiber bundles).\nAs we move from the world of natural materials to artificial man-made materials in search for novel formmaking strategies that comply with those of sustainable design, Nature’s way will remain a revealing\nsource of inspiration.

Similarly, in the framework of this thesis, Material is not\nconsidered as a subordinate attribute of form, but rather as its progenitor. Such is the story of form told\nfrom the point of view of matter, and it begins, unsurprisingly, with form’s crisis.\nTo paraphrase Darwin: there is more to the origin of form than the preservation of favorite expressions in\nthe struggle for style. By way of practice we are educated to apply matter opportunistically to any given\nform. This inherent design methodology implicitly assumes the predominance of shape over matter in\nprocesses of form-generation. However, when the order is inverted, we find that starting with matter is\nnot as straightforward a process as we might anticipate. Shape, it appears, (still) rules over matter.\n3.1.1\n\nForm First, Structure First, Material First: the Designer’s Causality Dilemma\n\nIt is important to stress that despite momentous progress in material science, engineering and construction, material has remained inferior to shape across most scales and disciplines of design. Indeed, most\nliterature in the realm of materials in architectural design has centered on questions relating to material\nselection rather than questions relating to material generation. Consequently, materials are traditionally\npre-defined and classified as property pools in the process of design materialization. Until recently, the\nfunction of materials in design processes thus appears to be considered and persistently treated as secondary to form itself. This condition has indeed been amplified by the construction industry and digital\nfabrication processes which have exacerbated the tendency of the designer to materialize form by liberally accessing materials as a library of open and eclectic potential. However, this is anything but a new\n\n70 THE NEW MATERIALITY\n\nphenomenon. A brief historical review of early forms of craft as well as some of the most innovative, au\ncourant, developments in material science and engineering, illuminates, yet again, the role of material as\nthe substance of form, rather than form’s progenitor.\nIn Nature’s Way we have demonstrated an alternative path to the generation of form whereby the interaction between material properties and their environment is (naturally) prioritized and thus precedes\nand propagates the resulting shapes. Material behavior in Nature appears to be a prerequisite for the\nemergence of form, and yet in design, shape eternally comes first. Given our methods and technologies\nfor design production, this condition is anything but coincidental. The tools that architects and designers\nuse today in the processes of form representation and generation assume geometric form’s instrumental\nsuperiority. In design, the process appears as simple and as straightforward as that: imagine, draw, apply\nand analyze; construction follows. Invert this process, and you will, again, arrive at Nature’s Way.\n3.1.2\n\nOrigins of a New Materiality in Design\n\nTo claim that the prioritizing of material in design is a recent discovery would be profoundly inaccurate.\nThe history of material science and engineering is a testament to cultural production and a protocol of\nthe way in which humans have interacted with their environment in their search for shelter, habitation\nand well-being (Ashby 1995). The significance of materials in the development of early civilizations\nis attested to by the way in which archaeology has divided technological progress into eras defined by\nmaterials endemic to them: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Today’s epoch may be\ndescribed as the Materials Age, as a result of new developments in materials and technologies which\nhave dramatically altered the way in which we make, build and live (Ashby 1995). Indeed, one of\nthe most thrilling precedents in the design of materials to date is the evolution of composites in all\nclasses and scales. Composites are a central chapter in the history of twentieth century technology as\ndemonstrated in Antonelli’s “Mutant Materials” exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art more than a\ndecade ago (Antonelli 1995). Yet even with the testament of such emerging tendencies of a design culture\nof the material, the problem of material’s inferiority complex to shape still lingers as a design cultural\nphenomenon characteristic of the theory and practice of modern design.\nThe literature concerning material in design is vast, though for the design researcher, it is also overwhelmingly fragmented. A survey of this open-ended field indicates the wide array of research areas\nrepresenting, exploring, classifying and researching the topic. There are many scientific and design\nviews of what may constitute the physical and behavioral characteristics of materials, and even more interpretations for each view. However, most importantly, each of these views may be useful to a particular\nconstruct of a given field and for a given application (Addington and Schodek 2005).\nThe breadth of interest and activity around new and innovative materials and material technologies today\nis one of the dominant influences upon contemporary architectural and industrial design. Kwinter has\nreferred to material as “the new space” (Kwinter 2001). This tendency is so prominent, in fact, that the\ndrive for material innovation in recent years has been broadly absorbed into the design and research of\nmainstream practice (Balmond, Smith et al. 2002; Addington and Schodek 2005). The design professions as a whole have experienced the renaissance in materials over the last few years. In addition to key\npublications and relevant excerpts from journal articles, leading exhibitions and publications highlight\nthe role of materials in design. In particular, design interest and experimentation with composites and\ntextile-like material design (McQuaid and Beesley 2005; Ritter 2007) has been abundant and exposed\nthe need to consolidate our methods and our practices.\nThis new materialism appears to have a diverse and complex influence upon contemporary design. Historically there are two distinct ways of influencing design. The first quickly absorbed material as a\nstylistic and formal phenomenon, while the second is more profound in exploring the complex interrela-\n\nShape over Matter: The Crisis of Form 71\n\ntions between science, technology and design that have only begun to emerge (Antonelli 1995; Antonelli\n2008).\nThe literature on the topic of smart, or intelligent, materials, and material systems is vast and has accumulated over the last decade to include designations as varied as the disciplinary contexts in which\nthey originated (Gordon 1976; Addington and Schodek 2005; McQuaid and Beesley 2005; McQuaid,\nBeesley et al. 2005; Braddock Clarke and OMahoney 2007; Ritter 2007). However, there exist two\nprevalent paradigms which may be used to classify most such designations (Rogers 1993). The first definition is based upon a technological paradigm and relates to the integration of actuators, sensors, and\ncontrols embedded within a material, or structural component. Such a definition specifies the elements\ncomprising the material but avoids completely addressing its utility and the means by which it has been\nfabricated and assembled. The second definition is based upon a science paradigm and it attempts to\nrelate predominantly to the material’s micro-structure as a system capable of informing its functionality.\nRelated sets of definitions in this paradigm include both the material’s structural functionality its ability\nto reduce mass and adapt to changing energetic constraints, and the way in which it has been fabricated.\nA detailed inspection of the relevant literary sources quickly communicates the well-known mentality in\narchitectural-design whereby materials are typically selected, not designed. Several material selection\nroutines and ways of classifying them have evolved over the years by and for different disciplines. The\nchoice of material cannot be made independently from the choice of process by which the material is\nformed, joined, finished, and otherwise treated (Ashby 1995; Ashby 2005). Similarly, the revival of\nmaterial consciousness in design is most likely associated with the fast rate at which fabrication technologies are entering contemporary discourse. As such tools develop, principles of material science and\ntechnology merge with other specialties such as engineering, chemistry, biotechnology, and information\nscience (McQuaid and Beesley 2005). This interdisciplinary state of design knowledge is rapidly finding\nits way where the most pressing issues and questions concerning the generation of form arise.\nThis chapter focuses on the latter class of materials and explores the material’s structure and behavior\nas defined by its properties devoid of the introduction of electronics. The aim is to explore the potential\nto reorganize matter from a purely physical perspective. Furthermore, it provides a critical review based\non a survey of the state-of-the-art of materials in design. It will start by questioning material’s role as\nshape filler, and point towards a potential shift in design process and thinking. It will highlight the roles\nmaterials currently possess as secondary to the generation of form itself, and in most cases tertiary\nto form’s rationalization as structural entity by the engineer. On the basis of this introduction it will\nraise key research issues and will propose a novel definition of new materiality as a non-hierarchical\nassociation between form, structure and material.\n3.2\n3.2.1\n\nThe Component Syndrome: Expressions of a Design Cultural Crisis\nForm as Iconic Shape\n\nArchitecturally speaking, when we think of “form” we think of the shape of a thing and how it might\nbe described in terms of its geometry. For thousands of years, the largest structures on earth were the\npyramids, but rarely does one refer to the distribution of load when describing the shape of a monumental\ntetrahedron. The nature of this claim remains consistent across the periods from ancient Egypt to Bilbao.\nForm is a category of description as opposed to a causal condition as it might be described in Nature.\nFurthermore, it is a well accepted in architectural practice that preconceived spaces of various forms\nand shapes have been conventionally designated for generic classes of functions. To challenge this\nclassical space-making tradition, architects have recently begun to exploit emergent technologies in the\nconstruction industry supported by a body of inventions in processes and materials. And, indeed, the\n\n72 THE NEW MATERIALITY\n\ngeneral prevailing assumption amongst many architects and designers is that all that is imaginable is\nbuildable. We are approaching an era in which this assumption is not too far from the truth. But coupled\nwith it, are many less exciting consequences, particularly when considering the environment. This,\nthe architect’s passionate search for form, has prioritized formal expression and consequently deeply\nvictimized environmental sustainability. A materials-based approach to design, potentially replacing this\nform syndrome with material sensibility, may be of significant impact in today’s climate of environmental\ncrisis.\n3.2.2\n\nForm as Assembly: Habitat as Machine for Producing Obsolescence\n\nBuilding by components is everywhere. They are the prevalent means by which to describe and construct\nform’s physical manifestation. Given that we cannot yet grow a design, as does Nature, we assemble it.\nMaterial assemblies have been around for many centuries. It was the industrial revolution however, in\nthe late 18th century that has planted the seeds of componentization as the logic for the mass-produced\nproduct.\nWith mass-production came ideas in design that conceived human habitat mechanistically, that is as\na living machine. Its advantages were clear and economically viable: all parts could be replicated,\nreplaced and reassembled in adaptation to change. However, this conception carried with it certain\nserious disadvantages which were soon to damage the natural environment. Material redundancy and\nwaste express only a small segment of what might be considered the condition of industrial pathology.\nThe building industry may still be identified with the value system projected by the industrial revolution:\nstandardization, homogenization, modularity, redundancy and repeatability. However, most or all of\nthese characteristics of industrialization are antithetical to Nature’s Way. Thus it comes as no surprise\nthat the economy and design culture of obsolescence are in profound contradiction to the contemporary\nsearch for a more sustainable design practice.\nForm driven by the design and control of materials across multiple scales may lead the way to a more\nenvironmentally responsible, structurally sound, and no-less formally expressive design approach.\n3.3\n\nThe Selection Syndrome: Methodological Expressions of a Design Cultural Syndrome\n\nGiven material’s typically secondary role in the expression of shape, the consideration of material as\n“shape filler” comes as no surprise. As such, material is characteristically selected from an array of\npotential matches between its properties and its hosting form. Ashby claims that the selection of a\nmaterial and process cannot be separated from the choice of shape (Ashby 1995; Ashby 2005). Such a\nclaim makes reasonable sense considering that each material presents the designer with its own set of\nproperties as well as geometrical and structural constraints. However this logic maintains the continued\npriority of shape over matter.\n3.3.1\n\nBeyond Material as Shape Filler\n\nThere exist various ways by which to classify materials. Material science and engineering classifications\ntypically deal with material composition and properties. Reflected in such classifications are insights\nthat provide a way of describing specific properties or qualities such as hardness, electrical conductivity,\netc. that characterize different materials3.1 . Consequently, while the material scientist is occupied with\n3.1\n\nThe Representative Volume Element (RVE) is one such way of classifying material properties within a singular volume\nelement. This concept is central to the mechanics and physics of random heterogeneous materials with a view to predicting\ntheir effective properties. The RVE size is associated with the estimation of the desired overall property of a material relative\n\nThe Selection Syndrome: Methodological Expressions of a Design Cultural Syndrome 73\n\nthe relationship between the structure of materials at atomic or molecular scales and their macroscopic\nproperties, the structural engineer engages with material behavior. In selecting the optimal material\nfor a given function, the engineer must weigh categories such as state, structure, processing techniques,\nenvironmental conditions, and applications (Addington and Schodek 2005).\nMichael Ashby’s material selection charts provide the designer and engineer with a highly efficient template of classification (Figure 3.1). In his Material Selection in Mechanical Design (Ashby 2005), Ashby\nintroduces a design tool for materials selection in engineering. It provides a highly consistent and systematic compilation of materials, their properties and applications in design.\nAshby classifies the family of engineering materials as six families including metals, polymers, elastomers, ceramics, glasses, and hybrids (Ashby 2005). Family members have a number of features in\ncommon such as properties, processing routines, and, often, similar applications. The family of hybrids includes combinations of two or more materials in a pre-determined configuration and scale. They\ninclude fiber and particulate composites, sandwich structures, lattice structures, foams, cables and laminates. Fiber-reinforced composites are of course the most familiar and incredibly desirable for their\ncombination of lightness, stiffness, strength and toughness.\nAshby’s material property charts were developed as a response to the designer’s need for an efficient\nmaterials selection process based on multiple criteria. Since it is almost always the case that the designer\nis interested in a combination of properties rather than a singular one, each material is presented as having\na set of attributes. In this way, ratios of strength to weight, and weight to stiffness may be considered in\nplotting one property against another. The resulting charts are useful in that they condense a large body\nof information into compact and accessible form. They reveal correlations between material properties\nthat aid in checking and estimating data along with a characteristic span of values (Ashby 1995; Ashby\n2005).\n3.3.2\n\nFrom Selection to Formation\n\nMaterials by themselves, however, require the application of innovative technologies, tools, and techniques that process them into shapes desired to fit their functions. In other words, the way in which a\nmaterial may be treated, directly affects its performance and its functional traits. The distinction between\nmaterial and matter carries much relevance in this context, the latter being traditionally associated with\nthe notion of an omnipotent substance that may be made into any desired shape (Smith 1980; Smith\n1981). Such “making” or “structuring” of matter, involves a deep understanding of material properties\nand their capacity for physical manipulation.\nRecent advancements in material science and engineering have introduced the notion of designing material behavior. The field of composite materials, specifically, the field of Material Science has enhanced\nthe designer’s capability to influence and control material behavior. All industries are equally inspired\nand affected by this climate while most design fields are contributing to the pool of exhilarating turnof-the-century products; architecture, building construction, civil engineering, transportation, medicine,\nagriculture, sports and fashion are all imposing pressing challenges on the state of design in the reinterpretation of the role of materials. This is unquestionably the age of materials.\nAs tools for the generation, production and construction of form turn into integral parts of computational\nenvironments for design. Through the concept of material behavior the physical qualities of form itself\nto the number of realizations of a given volume V of microstructure that one is able to consider. It is shown to depend on the\ninvestigated morphological or physical property, its contrast compared to the materials’ constituents, and their volume fractions.\nRVE sizes can be found for a range of physical properties including elastic strain energy and thermal conductivity, but also for\ngeometrical properties such as volume faction Gusev, A. (1997). “Representative volume element size for elastic composites:\na numerical study.” Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 45(9): 1449-1459.\n\n74 THE NEW MATERIALITY\n\nis gaining new interpretations.\n3.4\n3.4.1\n\nNature’s Way: Environmentally Informed Structural Heterogeneity\nAnisotropy: Nature’s Difference Engine\n\nTraditionally, we tend to classify materials, along with their various properties, either as structural or as\nfunctional (Stoneham and Harding 2003). Structural materials are mainly exploited for their mechanical\nproperties, while functional materials have some other purpose, in relation to electrical, thermal, optical properties, or combinations of them. In Nature, however, it is often quite challenging to distinguish\nbetween structural and functional materials as most biological materials such as wood can be both structural (supporting the branches of a tree) and functional (pumping water up to the leaves), with different\nscales for these different roles.\nNature achieves such integration by varying the material’s properties and introducing in it directional\n(structural) changes relative to their functions. This ability is termed anisotropy and has been briefly\ndescribed in the previous chapter. Generally speaking, anisotropy is defined as directional dependency.\nIt is expressed as a given difference in a material’s physical property (absorbance, refractive index, etc)\nwhen measured along different axes (Bar-Cohen 2006). Wood for instance, is a naturally anisotropic\nmaterial. Its physical properties vary widely when measured along the growth grain or against it (in other\nwords, there is a dependence of the Young’s modulus on the direction of load. This is also the reason why\nwood’s strength and hardness will be different for the same sample when measured in unique orientations.\nThe directional dependency of a physical property is easily found in most natural materials. Fiberreinforced composites and composite materials, in general, are highly anisotropic, displaying greater\nstrength along the grain/fiber direction than across it.\nAnisotropy is central to the structuring of materials and their behaviors. In the fields of Material Science\nand Engineering, the concept of anisotropy is tightly linked to a material’s microstructure defined by its\ngrain growth patterns and fiber orientation. However, beyond such scales, anisotropy may be utilized as\na design strategy. In design, examples vary depending on the type of property being examined and the\nmanufacturing technology applied to manipulate material organization. Over the last decade, advancements in textile design have proved, yet again, the distinctive role fibers play in the design of products\nand environments. High-performance textiles are everywhere: car-skins, skier’s helmets, spacesuits,\nmotorcycle racing gloves, sail boats, and ropes with integrated conductive fibers. Interestingly, some of\nthese applications transcend the scale of the micro.\nFinally, anisotropy is without a doubt one of the most important properties for a designer operating at\nthe heart of contemporary design culture. Its many potential interpretations as a method for controlling\nmaterial organizations seem incredibly promising in an age where developments in material science\nimpact processes and products in design. Yet the extent to which anisotropy is explored as a generative\nmeans to create form is still rather limited and unexplored. If one were able to model anisotropy in digital\nspace, prior to the actual production of form, what would it look like?\n3.4.2\n\nTowards an Artificial Anisotropy\n\nGordon’s seminal book The New Science of Strong Materials or Why You Don’t Fall through the Floor\n(Gordon 1976) proposes that a new science of strong materials is emerging as designers are able to\nmodify and improve materials by understanding their behavior. Gordon predicts that the coming new\nengineering materials will resemble much improved versions of wood and bone more than they will the\n\nNature’s Way: Environmentally Informed Structural Heterogeneity 75\n\nmetals with which most contemporary engineers are familiar3.2 .\nOne may consider that this new age of engineering materials allows the architect to move from a culture\nof material selection to that of material design. Such is the case of textile-inspired building concepts\nthat have been addressed recently by a number of design practitioners in the field. The FESTO company\nfor example has been investing in research and development of extreme textiles for inflatable structures.\nMost recently, Philip Beesley and Sean Hanna have contributed to an important publication highlighting\ndesign achievements in extreme textiles as part of a major exhibition displayed at the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum in 2005 (McQuaid and Beesley 2005). In the chapter “Transformed Architecture”\n(McQuaid and Beesley 2005), Beesley and Hanna identify the advantages of textile structures designating them as highly flexible, strong and lightweight. An example of the exploitation of these concepts are\nPeter Testa’s carbon-fiber towers which offer a strategy to eliminate joints and abrupt changes in material\nby producing continuous extrusions of carbon-fiber composite cables.\n3.5\n\nThe Promise of Composites: Towards a Natural Artifice\n\nIt is well accepted that the properties exhibited by structural materials are governed by their chemical\ncomposition and the spatial arrangements of their constituents across multiple scales. The quest for\nsuperior material properties has typically been dominated by sources of raw materials and discoveries\nin processing conditions. Significant improvements in material science and engineering, however, have\nafforded the designer with the ability to design microstructure-property relationships and processes by\nwhich to control material chemistry and microstructure.\nWith the introduction of composite materials, designers can finally prioritize material design over material selection. In the following section we review precedents from the world of craft as well as high-tech\ndesigns demonstrating the designer’s ability to control material properties and relate them to some global\nfunction. In this way, a new design approach may be promoted in which material properties may vary\ncontinuously in order to correspond to external structural or environmental requirements.\n3.5.1\n\nFoams: Variable Property Density\n\nFoams are cellular materials which hold large quantities of air. Almost any material can be foamed, and\ndifferent techniques are applied in order to foam different types of solids. Amongst them are polymers,\nmetals, ceramics, glasses, and composites (Gibson, Tonyan et al. 1992; Gibson 1995; Gibson and Ashby\n1997). When foamed, these cellular solids become lighter. This process allows the designer control over\nother sufficient related properties such as density, thermal conductivity, Young’s modulus and compressive strength. Foams are therefore often used as shock-absorbing materials, and heat or sound insulators.\nIn this sense, foams significantly extend the range of properties available to the designer and engineer\n(Gibson, Ashby et al. 1987; Gibson and Ashby 1997)\nFoams are frequently classified as rigid, semi-rigid and flexible. Their cells are either open or closed\nand, as a result, their capacity to absorb water or air, as well as their capacity to return to their initial\nshape after deformation, varies. There are so-called ‘delayed’ or ‘memory’ foams or viscoelastic foams,\nwhich return very slowly. Foams are commercially identified by their density (g/cm3 or kg/m3 ). Plastic\nfoams are commonly obtained by the expansion of a gas liberated by a chemical process. Polyurethane\nfoams are the most common: flexible (for mattresses, cushions, and chairs) or rigid (expanded foams\nused for insulation in buildings). There are latex foams at the higher end of the market but with an\naverage mechanical strength which as a result need protection (covering or a polymer skin). Aluminum\n3.2\nIn this context, Gordon introduces a profound overview of elasticity and the theory of strength, non-metallic materials\n(timer, cellulose, glue, plywood and composites), the metallic tradition and beam formulas.\n\n76 THE NEW MATERIALITY\n\nfoam very light cellular material very strong in compression is used as the core of a sandwich material\nor for its dramatic aesthetic aspects; copper foam for its electrical conductivity, recycled glass foam is\nused as an insulating covering material.\n3.5.2\n\nComposites: Variable Property Elasticity\n\nComposites have been around for centuries. Artisans and craftsmen have throughout history exploited the\ndiverse properties of materials as they mastered skillful techniques to combine and convert raw materials\ninto objects of consumption and beauty (Smith 1981). Among the most primitive composite materials to\nhave existed were straw and mud in the form of bricks for building construction.\nTypically, there are two categories of constituent materials - matrix and reinforcement - which make\nup a composite. At least one portion of each type is required. The matrix material surrounds and supports the reinforcement materials by maintaining their relative position. The reinforcements impart their\nspecial mechanical and physical properties to enhance the matrix properties. Such synergy produces\nmaterial properties that are superior to many natural materials. Due to the wide variety of matrix and\nreinforcement materials available, the design potential of composites is incredible.\n3.5.3\n\nFunctional Gradient Materials: Variable Property Synthesis\n\nThe distribution of material properties as a function of their performance requirements at micro structural\nscale is elegantly exemplified with the development and application of Functional Gradient Materials\n(FGM’s). The term was developed in the mid 1980’s in Japan in the design of a hypersonic space plane\nproject where a particular combination of materials used would be required to serve the purpose of a\nthermal barrier capable of withstanding a surface temperature of 2000K and a temperature gradient of\n1000K across a 10mm section.\nThe general idea of structural gradients was initially proposed for composites and polymeric materials in\n1972 (Miyamoto, Kaysser et al. 1999) but it was not until the 1980’s when actual models investigating\nthe design, fabrication and evaluation of graded structures were proposed (Figure 3.2).\nFunctionally graded materials are a new generation of engineering materials characterized by compositional and structural variation across their volume unit, resulting in property changes in the material\nsuch as mechanical shock resistance, thermal insulation, catalytic efficiency and relaxation of thermal\nstress (Miyamoto, Kaysser et al. 1999). Spatial variation is achieved through non-uniform distribution of reinforcement phases (regions of space with unique chemical uniform and physically distinct\ncharacteristics). Reinforcements are inserted with different properties, sizes, and shapes, as well as by\ninterchanging the roles of the reinforcement and matrix phases in a continuous manner. The resultant\nmicrostructure is characterized by continuously or discretely changing its thermal and mechanical properties at the macroscopic or continuum scale. In this way materials can be designed for specific functions\nand applications.\nVarious approaches exist which are used to fabricate FGM’s such as perform processing, layer processing\nand melt processing. The basic structural unit of an FGM resembles biological units such as cell and\ntissues, and is referred to as an element or a material ingredient. Bamboo, shell, tooth and bone are\nall made up of graded structures consisting of chemical, physical, geometrical and biological material\ningredients.\nThe concept of FGMs is revolutionary in the areas of material science and mechanics as it allows one to\nfully integrate between material and structural considerations in the final design of structural components.\nFGMs are applicable to many fields. In the engineering applications it is applied to cutting tools, machine\nparts, and engine components. Various combinations of these ordinarily incompatible functions can be\n\nThe Promise of Composites: Towards a Natural Artifice 77\n\napplied to create new materials for aerospace, chemical plants, and nuclear energy reactors. However,\nthe application of FGMs in product and architectural design construction scale has not been thoroughly\nresearched and developed.\nFunctionally graded materials stand out as a special class of materials characterized by the gradual variation in composition and structure over volume, resulting in corresponding structure-property relationships. Unlike any other class of materials, FGMs are “designed materials”, assembled rather than selected\nfor a particular function or application. Given the designer’s freedom to define the material microstructure based on its properties, any composite material could be made simply by varying the microstructure\nfrom one material to another with a specific gradient. Such processes facilitate the designer with the\npossibility of combining the ultimate properties of each material into one. Generally approximated by\nmeans of a power series, the transition between the two materials is achieved by combining several discrete layers, each containing localized optimal properties. Here, the notion of “units” is relevant insofar\nas it defines the micro-structural property of the material relative to its attributed mechanical functions.\nThe basic unit for FGM representation is the maxel (Miyamoto, Kaysser et al. 1999). Its attributes\ninclude the location and volume fraction of individual material components. The term maxel is also\nused in the context of additive manufacturing processes to describe a physical voxel defining the build\nresolution of a rapid prototyping or rapid manufacturing process, or the resolution of a design produced\nby such fabrication means.\n3.5.4\n\nBlurring the Boundaries between “Material” and “Structure”\n\nThe parting between “material” and “structure” in the material world, material being associated with\nthe artificial built environment, has been the direct result of the hierarchy implied by the design process\nitself. Material, in the traditional sense of the word and the concept, is theoretically reduced to act as the\n“filler of form”. By practical extension, “material” has traditionally been regarded as homogeneous and\nconsistent in properties, effects and appearance. Only recently, with advances in composite materials and\nother related developments of functionally gradient materials, has the term earned meaningful semantic\nsignificance.\nToday, the term “material” might as well be reconsidered as the “microstructure” of a structural component. Since designers have now gained the ability to weave plastic fibers and layer wooden sheets in\ncorrespondence to particular mechanical requirements, the difference between “material” and “structure”\namounts to functional scale.\nAs we have previously determined, the distinction between material and structure in the biological world,\noccupies indefinable territory that is at best elusive. In his book Structural Biomaterials, Julian Vincent\nclaims that when dealing with biology from an engineering standpoint such distinctions are extremely\nchallenging. Hair, horn, cuticle and wood all have “structure” and yet all of them are mostly treated\nas materials (Vincent 1982). Moreover, Vincent claims that only once a distinction has been made can\nsuch complex materials be scrutinized. According to Vincent, the conflict is resolved by a simple test:\nmaterials have the same stiffness in tension, bending and compression. If they don’t, we must be dealing\nwith a structure, and the measured stiffness is not a material parameter (Vincent 1982). But, could it be,\nthat below a certain size level of the components one does not need to consider the structure of a material\nand may consider it as homogeneous?\nAccording to Vincent, it is often possible to identify a size threshold below which the structure of a\nmaterial does not affect its mechanical properties. The threshold changes depending on the size of the\ntest piece and the conditions under which the test is carried out. By observing the response of the test\npiece, its deformation, and the size hierarchy at which the main interfacial influences occur, it is possible\nto determine, if we are looking at a material or a structure. A great example given by Vincent is the\n\n78 THE NEW MATERIALITY\n\nobservation of bone fracture. In the well-mineralized bone, the functional unit is the osteon, whereas\nin the less-mineralized bone, the main functional unit is the collagen-hydroxyapatite fiber. The same\ncould be applied to the design of products and buildings. In a groin vault for instance, structural failure\nmay occur at the brick level (analog here to the osteon) and/or at the thrust line the line of action of the\nresulting compressive force connecting between the four vaults (Figure 3.3).\nIn the former case, the brick acts both as the material and as the structure (as its boundaries determine\nthe location of failure) whereas in the latter case, the groin vault geometry is the structure, which also\nhappens to be made up of bricks. As a result it is relatively straightforward to assume that structural\nfailure assists in negotiating between the domains of structure and material, and that, eventually, the\ndistinction boils down to the scale of the functional units.\nAmongst other scientists who have referred to the distinction between structure and materials is Michael\nAshby, is his book: Material Selection in Mechanical Design (Ashby 1995; Ashby 2005). In the chapter\nrelating to the “selection of material and shape” (Chapter 11 in Ashby 1995), Ashby assets that natural\nshapes achieve structural efficiency through their microscopic shape.\nMicrostructures are extensive by their very nature as they repeat themselves. Due to this nature, they can\nbe thought of as “materials” in their own right possessing their respective modulus, strength, and density\n(Ashby 1995; Ashby 2005). As reviewed in the previous chapter, many natural materials such as wood,\nbone, stalks and leaves may be characterized by their unique repeated microstructure. Ashby carries on\nby claiming that provided they are large enough compared with the size of their micro-structural cells;\nshapes can be cut from such materials that inherit their properties. Ashby employs the term “shape” to\nconsist of the external, macro-shape, of a given material, and the internal, or micro-shape, of the same\nmaterial (Ashby 2005). A cellular structure or a honeycomb are two good such examples demonstrating\nmicro structural solid organization (Gibson and Ashby 1997).\nAshby’s macro- and micro-shape diagrams are a great example of a very clear distinction between shape\nand material, following Vincent’s logic and tests (Figures 3.4, 3.5). However, as we have previously\nseen in Nature’s Way, that there exists an intermediate scale between shape and material which defines a\ncertain relationship between them. For example, in order to increase its stiffness and its strength, wood’s\nsolid component made of cellulose, lignin and other polymers is shaped into very small prismatic cells\nwhich vary in density as they disperse the solids further from the axis of bending or twisting of the tree\ntrunk and its branches (Ashby 1995). In other words, by controlling the variation of material properties as\na function of the shape they relate to, Nature negotiates structure and material. Moreover, in Nature one\nwould not be able to find cases of “material patching” such as the ones described in Ashby’s diagrams\nabove. Instead, the density of the shape’s micro-structure would change in order to fit the function of its\nmacro shape. A few examples may relate to the distribution of micro-structural patterns relative to the\ndirection of load applied on the shape. For instance, ‘I’ beams would be constructed with denser patterns\nin the periphery and sparser ones in the center in order to account for potential buckling, bending and\ntwisting, while also saving material. We shall refer to such strategy as a Material Distribution Function.\n3.6\n3.6.1\n\nSlow Craft: Low-Tech Cases in Material-based Design\nThe Wavy Hamon, a Swordsmith’s Dilemma: a Case in Material Conditioning\n\nHow does one create a sword both strong enough to hold a sharp edge and soft enough to bend? Beset\nwith the finest details of material craft, Viking and medieval European swords have long had staying\npower as objets d’art and testimonies of engineering genius. Heated, welded, cut, forged, bent and\ntwisted, such artifacts were designed as the very substance of warfare. Striking form and practical function are combined in skillful processes of material re-surfacing and structuring.\n\nSlow Craft: Low-Tech Cases in Material-based Design 79\n\nThe finished sword’s function and performance were determined by its shape, proportion, and its physical\nproperties. The steel had just about the right combination of hardness and toughness as it was repeatedly\nwelded to refine its structure before forging the blade (Figures 3.6-3.10). The shifting colors during\nheating indicated the temperature of the glowing steel. At the right moment and the optimal temperature,\nthe blade was taken from the hearth quenched in water or oil. Finally it was tempered to eliminate\nbrittleness. The blade, as a result, was hard enough to hold a keen edge but was still flexible enough not\nto break during use (Smith 1981).\nPristine in its entirety, yet the creation of the Samurai sword surmounted a technological impossibility:\nthe blade has to be forged in order to hold a very sharp edge and, concurrently, not break in the ferocity\nof a dual. To create steel both brittle (it must be hard enough to take a sharp edge), and soft (it must not\nbreak) was an almost unfeasible metallurgical challenge.\nIn seeking to settle the swordsmith’s dilemma, Japanese sword artisans used a combination of four metal\nbars each holding different properties. A soft iron bar guarded against the potential breaking of the blade,\ntwo hard iron bars prevented bending and a steel bar took a sharp cutting edge. All four bars were heated\nat a high temperature and then hammered together into a long rectangular bar that would become the\nsword blade. As the swordsmith ground the blade to sharpen it, the steel took the razor-sharp edge, while\nthe softer metal ensured the blade would not break. This intricate forging process brought about the wavy\nhamon, or ‘temper line’ a major qualifier in judging a blade’s artistic merit.\n3.6.2\n\nGreat Mosque of Djenné and the First Composites: a Case in Material Composition\n\nAdobe bricks are the earliest case of material composites known. They serve as a natural building\nmaterial composed of sand mixed with water, straw and other organic materials shaped into bricks using\nwooden frames and dried evenly in the sun. The straw is useful in binding the brick together while\nallowing it to dry evenly. Bricks are made in an open frame, and the mixture is molded by the frame\nbefore its removal. After drying, the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying. The same mixture to\nmake bricks, without the use of the straw, is used for mortar and often for plaster on interior and exterior\nwalls. Some ancient cultures used lime-based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage.\nAn adobe wall has major environmental effects as it can serve as a heat reservoir due to its relatively\ndense thermal mass; therefore this type of construction is most useful in tropical climates.\nThe Great Mosque of Djenné is the largest adobe building in the world and is considered by many to\nbe one of the greatest achievements of the Sudano-Sahelian architectural style, with Islamic influences\n(Figure 3.11). Its walls are made of sun-baked mud bricks called ferey, a type of mud based mortar,\nand are coated with a mud plaster which gives the building its smooth, sculpted look. Wall thickness\nvaries depending on its height: taller sections were traditionally built thicker because the base has to\nbe wide enough to support the weight. Bundles of palm wood were included in the building to reduce\ncracking caused by frequent drastic changes in humidity and temperature and to serve as readymade\nscaffolding for annual repairs. The walls insulate the building from heat during the day and by nightfall\nhave absorbed enough heat to keep the mosque warm through the night.\n3.6.3\n\nThe Baidarka Kayak: a Case in Material Assembly\n\nA Kayak is a hunter’s boat, some of which are at least 4000 years old. The boat’s primary purpose was\nto hunt animals on inland lakes, rivers and the sea. The Kayak was made of seal skins and wood (Figures\n3.12, 3.13). The wood was driftwood that was collected from beaches, since many of the areas where\nkayaks were paddled are void of the land-based raw materials used in making birch bark or dugout canoes. The baidarka kayak is a special kayak. The word refers to the double and triple kayaks developed\n\n80 THE NEW MATERIALITY\n\nby the Alaskan Aleut. The baidarka kayak (Iceland, 1806) meshes small pieces of bone into a wooden\nsuperstructure in strategic zones requiring maximum flexibility. This technique illustrates an early example of a composite material with non-homogenous properties, since the combination of bone, wood, and\nleather contribute to the local variance of the boat’s rigidity along its length. An exterior performance\nparameter, such as the floating of the boat on waves, becomes the incentive to manipulate not only its\nshape (as it happens in the design of all boats), but also its locally adjusted material composition (Class\nnotes from MIT Class 4.195, Special Problems in Architectural Design, Alexandros Tsamis-Jimmy Shen,\nExercise III: Material Deployment Investigation, 2005, based on Dyson, 2002).\nThe variety of skin-on-frame kayaks made by the Aleuts of Alaska is typically called “Baidarkas”. The\nbig advantage for the traditional builders of skin-on-frame kayaks, the Aleut and Inuit residents of the far\nnorth, is that they could be built with the materials on hand. The frame did not require big pieces of wood\nand could be made with material that drifts up on the beach. The skin was made from their primary food\nspecies, the seal. This set up an interesting chicken-and-egg situation, because they needed the kayak to\ncatch seals and they need seals to make the kayak. The resulting boat was light weight, rugged, resilient\nand easy to maintain. Due to the construction technique and materials used, any skin on frame boat is\ninherently flexible. There is some thought that this hull flexibility also offers some efficiency advantages.\n3.6.4\n\nWeaving the First Hut: a Case in Material Organization\n\nWeaving is an ancient textile craft that involves placing two sets of threads or yarn made of fiber on a\nloom and turning them into cloth. In general, weaving involves the interlacing of two sets of threads\nat right angles to each other: the warp and the weft. The warp are held taut and in parallel by means\nof a loom. The loom is warped (or dressed) with the warp threads passing through heddles on two or\nmore harnesses. The warp threads are moved up or down by the harnesses creating a space called the\nshed. The weft thread is wound onto spools called bobbins. The bobbins are placed in a shuttle which\ncarries the weft thread through the shed. The raising/lowering sequence of warp threads gives rise to\nmany possible weave structures from the simplest plain weave, through complex computer-generated\ninterlacings (Figure 3.14).\nBoth warp and weft can be visible in the final p roduct. By spacing the warp more closely, it can completely cover the weft that binds it, giving a warp faced textile. Conversely, if the warp is spread out, the\nweft can slide down and completely cover the warp, giving a weft faced textile, such as a tapestry or a\nKilim rug. There are a variety of loom styles for hand weaving and tapestry. In tapestry, the image is\ncreated by placing weft only in certain warp areas, rather than across the entire warp width.\nThe practice of hut and basket weaving demonstrate interesting ways by which fibers can be distributed\nto correspond with required local strength and flexibility.\n3.7\n\nRapid Craft: High-Tech Cases in Material-based Design\n\nThe following case-studies - both from the domain of extreme sports - illustrate the significance of variable property design achieved by the development of high-end composites and their respective fabrication\ntechnologies.\n3.7.1\n\nPole-vaulting: A Case Study in Stiffness Variation\n\nIf its novel, it’s in the Olympics. The Olympic Games have traditionally constituted a major opportunity\nfor the sports to celebrate advances in engineering. Such is the case with pole vaulting. Pole vaulting,\nas an athletic activity, dates back to the ancient Greeks and its development, as a bendable beam used\nfor jumping, illustrates how the shift to composites resulted in major athletic performance improvements\n(Figure 3.15).\n\nSlow Craft: Low-Tech Cases in Material-based Design 81\n\nBeam stiffness is a significant concept for many types of structures, particularly those shaped with slender\nproportions, such as trees, skyscrapers, bones and chairs. Inadequate beam stiffness could lead to large\ndeflections, high localized stresses and failure in a particular region. In addition to bending moments,\nsuch structures may be subjected to twisting and torsional moments (torques). Pole-vaults are a great\nexample of stiffness variation designed to account for its special performance.\nIn pole-vaulting, the highest stresses occur on the outside of the bent beam. In addition, within the\nmiddle zone of the pole, positioned across its height and known as its neutral axis, there are minimum\nor no stresses at all. There is, therefore, no need to place any material mass down its center. Bamboo\nfor instance, which is a naturally hollow material, is much lighter per unit length than a solid pole - yet\nprovides the same maximum stress. Give that pole-vaulting essentially involves the conversion of the\nkinetic energy of the running athlete to the potential energy of the jump using strain energy stored in the\npole (the energy stored in elastic deformation), a lighter pole enables an athlete carrying a bamboo pole\nto take a faster run-up or to use a slightly longer pole.\nPoles were originally made out of solid wood, probably hickory. Slightly more flexible bamboo poles\nwere introduced in the early 1900s and a sharp increase in the achievable height coincided with the\nadvent of composite poles made of fiberglass, about 50 years ago. In its elastic recovery, these poles\nare sufficiently strong and flexible to allow substantial amounts of energy to be transformed into elastic\nstrain energy stored in the deformed pole, and consequently transformed again into potential energy. The\nmechanics of beam bending is clearly integral to this phenomenon. The sharp increase in achievable\nheight that coincided with the switch to composite poles was due to a change in the mechanics of pole\nvaulting. Bamboo or metal poles with sufficient flexibility to allow significant energy storage would,\nrespectively, be likely to fracture or plastically deform. Today, pole vaults are made by wrapping pre-cut\nsheets of fiberglass around a metal mandrel to produce a slightly pre-bent pole that would bend easily\nunder compression with the athlete’s take-off. The weights, length and stiffness of the pole are a function\nof the density and directionality of carbon fibers as they are laid out on the composite sheets.\n3.7.2\n\nExtreme Sailing: A Case Study in Elastic Variation\n\nBoat builders were amongst the very first to experiment with carbon-reinforced composites. As early\nas the 1970’s the pioneering innovator Edward S. (“TED”) Van Dusen discovered that most standard\nconstruction materials had about the same specific stiffness per unit weight. This led him to experimenting with composites and making the first carbon-fiber composite Advantage racing shells (McQuaid and\nBeesley 2005). Satin weaves made of glass fiber in complex twill afforded Van Dusen the opportunity to\nlocally inform the physical behavior of the sail. Within the weave each weft may float over as many as\nseven warps. With fewer points of intersection, the fiber has less stability, but more fiber can be packed\ninto the structure. The density minimizes the risk of pinholes forming in the composite, keeping the boat\nwatertight. The dependency between the fibers’ material properties and their structural geometry, and\ntheir ordering organizations, are all contributors to the performance of the sail (Figure 3.16).\nThe 1980’s experienced exponential growth in the field of textile design when high-performance fibers\nsuch as aramids and carbon fibers have been a major force driving the markets and industries of aerospace\nand the military (McQuaid and Beesley 2005).\nAs composite reinforcements, textiles offer a high level of customization with regard to type and weight\nof fiber, use of combinations of fibers, and use of different weaves to maximize the density of fibers in a\ngiven direction (McQuaid and Beesley 2005). Fiber strength is greatest along the length. The strength of\ncomposite materials derives from the intentional use of this directional nature.\nFibers are considered high-performance, if they possess exceptional strength, strength-to-weight ratio,\nchemical or flame resistance, or range of operating temperatures. Weaving, braiding, knitting and em-\n\n82 THE NEW MATERIALITY\n\nbroidery have existed for centuries. However, combined with an ability to locally control reinforcement,\nhigh performance fibers are contributing to incredible leaps in the performance of products and buildings\nalike.\n3.8\n3.8.1\n\nDesign beyond Selection: Current Problems Limitations\nPatch Hide: the Problem with Smart Materials\n\nAs new research avenues find practical expression within design and architectural practice, it is clear that\nthe design of better, lighter, stronger, more effective and efficient materials will be moving the industry\nforward. The design and control of a material’s micro-structure is seemingly coupled with any potential\nreal-time behaviors that may be incorporated into its functional portrait. So significant and far-reaching is\nthe progress occurring in the area of smart-materials that one finds it hard to avoid addressing its relevant\nand contribution in this context.\nWhat distinguishes a smart material from a traditional one is that for both traditional and high-performance\nmaterials there is a mostly fixed response to external stimuli. In other words, for a traditional material,\nproperties remain constant under standard conditions (Addington and Schodek 2005)3.3 . Smart materials on the other hand, are either property changing or energy exchanging (or both). Property changing\nmaterials trigger intrinsic response variation that is specific to any given internal or external stimuli. Energy exchanging responses trigger extrinsic response variation that can be computationally controlled or\nenhanced. There also exist combinations of such classes of materials in smart devices and systems in\nwhich smart materials are embedded in devices or systems with intrinsic response variations and related\ncomputational enhancements to multiple internal or external stimuli or controls. Finally, intelligent environments combine intrinsic and cognitively guided response variations of whole environments comprised\nof smart devices and systems to use conditions and internal or external stimuli.\nThe main problem behind such environments is that they are typically patched atop an existing structural\nor architectural system. Such “patching” strategies result in functional assemblies and kinetically actuated facades and products which require much energy to operate, and are typically maintained by global\ncontrol. It is an assumption of the research that next-generation construction materials may support dynamic (in addition to their currently, static) spatially-differentiated material compositions and structural\nforms. The aim is to combine structural, optical, and fluidic behaviors which are governed by the material architecture, as well as the interactions between materials and their environment. Such material\narchitectures could simultaneously bear large structural load, change their transparency so as to control\nlight levels within a building or vehicle, and open and close embedded pores so as to ventilate a space.\n3.8.2\n\nFabricating Difference: the Problem of Material Scale\n\nAchieving structural heterogeneity in micro-structural levels to accommodate for varying (anticipated)\nload conditions is promising insofar as it may be applied to projects of micro-structural scale. The\nmain problem arises when we attempt to translate some of these meso-scale capabilities, as exemplified\nthrough the use of foams, composites and FGMs, into macro-scale architectural and engineering design\nproblems. Imagine, for instance, that a singular beam or better yet, an entire building system, could be\n3.3\nFurther technically disposed content is offered by Addington and Schodek’s “Smart Materials and Technologies”. The\nvolume includes a comprehensive account of smart materials, their classification and characterization across various scales, as\nwell as the inclusion of elements and control systems integrated into materials such as sensors and micro-electrical mechanical\nsystems. The book concludes with a classification of components and assemblies applied to facades, lighting systems, energy\nsystems and structural systems.\n\nSlow Craft: Low-Tech Cases in Material-based Design 83\n\nconstructed out of variable-property concrete so as to modulate its density as a function of anticipated\nloading conditions.\nVariable-property design at construction scale is yet to succeed in challenging conventional full-scale\nconstruction systems. Indeed, architectural building codes and standards often supersede performance\ncriteria with an attempt to simplify the selection process and remove liability for performance failures\n(Addington and Schodek 2005). Frequently, this supersedes results in the simplification of material\ncomposition with the aim of homogenizing the construction process in order to subscribe to performance\nstandards. In Nature however, as we have seen, “every tree is different”. It logically follows then, that\nmechanisms for the production of difference in material performance must be integrated with industrial construction processes before we may achieve Nature’s Way. To paraphrase, modern construction\nmethods prioritize efficiency over effectiveness, whereas Nature combines efficiency and effectiveness\nin ingenious ways.\nThere are some relevant sources worth exploring in this context. One such case is John Fernandez’\nMaterial Architecture (Fernandez 2006) which inspires the conceptual, methodological and practical\nshift from the material scale to that of construction, not without responding to building codes promoting\nsustainable design methods. Accompanied by essays and studies profoundly geared towards topics of\nsustainable design and construction, the book highlights the role of emerging materials in contemporary\npractice and offers a comprehensive and synthetic understanding of the topic in architectural design\ntoday. It highlights the condition that general structures of materials behave quite differently at the micro\nand macro levels, and that such behaviors must be accounted for when translating from micro to macro\nscale as the structure of a material at each of these levels will strongly influence its final characteristics\nand properties. It is thus imperative to reconsider the mechanisms and technologies promoting structural\nheterogeneity in building scale.\n3.8.3\n\nLoad over Light: The Problem of Disciplinary-based Parameterization\n\nIn the milieu of design, the concept of material performance encompasses many, and often conflicting,\ninterpretations which vary as we have seen previously - with the type and method of property classification. Central to the definition and utilization of material performance parameters and their dimensions, is\nthe distinction between criteria associated with architectural, or design performance and those associated\nwith engineering performance.\nWhile the engineering disciplines prioritize structural integrity and environmental soundness against\nbuilding loads, seismic loads and wind loads, to name a few, the architect in her consideration of comfort\nand well-being searches for spatial qualities of, and in relation to spatial distribution, visibility, and\noccupant comfort. As a result, many parameters must be re-negotiated in order to account for the various\nfamilies of constraints.\n3.8.4\n\nFrom Structuring Materials to Designing Form: The Problem of Structural Hierarchy\n\nLast but not least is the question regarding the origin of form. It is relatively easy to imagine how\ncertain of these ideas may apply to the structuring of an already existing form in terms of its physical\nor material expression. Clearly, the form of human bone is determined by anatomical constraints which,\nin turn, comply with the physiological and chemical process involved in the distribution of cancellous\nbone matter. In other words, the structural (and otherwise, environmental) distribution of matter per a\ngiven boundary condition defining global form is not too challenging to imagine. It is, however, quite a\ncomplex design mission to develop a process in which the generation of form goes hand in hand with its\nsubstance formation.\n\n84 THE NEW MATERIALITY\n\nGranted, there are numerous approaches to the structuring of materials per a given form. However, the\nquestion still remains what are the implications of allowing form to emerge as a function of material properties and environmental constraints, and how might such an approach be facilitated in and by design?\nWe will attempt to answer this question and the other problematic highlighted above in the following\nchapter.\n3.9\n\nMatter over Shape: Towards Material-based Design Computation\n\nThe implications of controlling material heterogeneity at building scales from a design perspective are\nimmense, especially in terms of efficiencies and effectiveness of both products and processes and their\ncapacity to respond to external local requirements and pressures. But how to move from substance\nvariation to formal expression and from material to construction scale is among the core questions of this\nwork.\nWe assume that if we were able to compute the distribution of matter as a function of structural and\nenvironmental performance, we would be able not only to control substance variation defined per a given\nboundary condition, but better still, we could utilize such methods for the generation of form itself.\nGiven that we are now well aware of such an ambition, drawing from Nature’s Way (Chapter 2); and\ngiven that the range of material possibilities with their various scales have been sufficiently reviewed\nin this chapter, we are now ready to explore the potential of computational process to computationally\nsupport and instrumentalize a material-based design approach.\nThe ability to strategically utilize and exploit relationships between the spatial arrangements of material\nconstituents and their bulk properties across various length scales will make possible the future description of material properties in terms of architectural parameters and qualities. Moreover, as heterogeneity\nand multi-functionality (both of which are representations of morphological adaptation) become designable - as this thesis will demonstrate the ability to independently manipulate material properties and\ndevelop structural materials with vastly superior properties corresponding to their environmental surroundings will be achieved. Such exploitation of the architectural features of materials, structures and\nspaces will expand and enhance the design space as structural properties are negotiated with environmental ones without compromising functionality. Already, the applications of materials with such controlled\nmicro-structural architectures are pervasive, and will result in breakthrough improvements in strength,\nstiffness, fracture toughness, energy absorption, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion and weight.\nCoupled with environmental constraints, controlled heterogeneity of material properties and effects may\neventually reproduce Nature’s Way.\n\nSlow Craft: Low-Tech Cases in Material-based Design 85\n\nFigure 3.1: Michael Ashby’s Material Selection Charts (from right to left, top to bottom): Young’s modulus Density\nchart, Fracture toughness Modulus chart, Strength Density chart, T-expansion T-conductivity chart.

Developed primarily as a digital substitute for manual drafting of technical and engineering drawings, the output of\nCAD typically conveys symbolic information such as shape compositions, dimensions, and tolerances\nbased on application-specific conventions. CAD is extensively used across various disciplines with many\ndomain-specific applications including those for the automotive, shipbuilding, and aerospace industries,\nindustrial and architectural design, among others. Within the field of architectural design, CAD is a major driving force for research in computational fields such as computational geometry, computer graphics\nand discrete differential geometry. Furthermore, CAD occupies a wide variety of design applications\nranging from modeling (digital generation in the digital domain), to analysis (digital mapping of the\nphysical domain), to digital fabrication (physical generation of the digital domain).\nThe ubiquitous and nearly pervasive use of computer-aided design, engineering and manufacturing (respectively known as CAD, CAE, and CAM) in architecture, frequently serves in current design practice\nas the facilitative technology by which to materialize the contemporary predilection for complex geometries and, so called, free-form design. In this sense such computer-aided environments might well be\nconsidered as the automated extension of traditional form description and form-making processes that\npreceded CAD’s invention (Oxman 2007; Oxman 2007; Oxman 2008).\n4.1.1\n\nFrom Aid to Engine\n\nDigital extensions of traditional, conventionalized design methodological processes have earned legitimacy and value as aids in supporting mediated design. Aiding the reformulation or pre-conceived form,\n\nThe Crisis of Form 99\n\nsuch tools fall short of incorporating material properties and behavior constraints, as well as fabrication\nand construction processes inherent to them. Indeed, in dismissing the capacity of computational tools\nto support form-generation processes motivated by objectives other than the generation of form itself,\ncomputer-aided design appears as a whole to facilitate a status of “more of the same”. As a result, the\nworld of architectural design, now so saturated with excessive formal expression, continues to be dominated by top-down design decisions favoring form over material with their subsequent implications on\nthe built environment. Looks, however, is not all that matters.\nIn cultivating design processes inspired by Nature’s way we seek to employ alternative computational\nprocesses supporting the generation of form based on the interaction between material and environment.\nThis entails a shift from computationally assistive processes to processes of a generative and performative\nnature. In other words, we aim to move from computer aided design to material-based design computation. This transformation potentially allows the designer to perform form generative processes while\naddressing material and environmental considerations. This new medium of performance and materialbased generation also potentially allows the designer to achieve forms of a material-ecological nature,\nthat is, a new vocabulary otherwise unattainable.\n4.1.2\n\nObjectives and Organization\n\nThe objective of this chapter is to review the evolution of concepts and issues in the field of design\ncomputation that are relevant to these general objectives and to characterize the emergence of a contemporary theoretical discourse and technical developments in Material-based Design Computation4.1 . It is\nimportant to note that all prior research into physically related computation resulted from the objectives\nto capture, or trace, pre-generated form. Consequently there is no research dedicated to questions of how\nto design form based upon the properties of material. It will be demonstrated that such an approach will\nenable us to move from the digital manifestation of physical form to its physical manifestation of digital\nform in a unique computational design process.\nThe chapter includes a survey of relevant techniques in computational design that support form-generation\nprocesses within computational geometry environments. Examples of such techniques include particle\nsystems, multi-agent systems, network analysis, and finite element methods among others. The aim here\nis to explore such computational design precedents and demonstrate how inherently related or removed\nare such techniques from the projected material processes of form-generation.\n4.2\n\nNatural Computing: Design Computing Inspired by Nature\n\nNatural Computing is the terminology introduced by de Castro to encompass three approaches in the\nrelationship between nature and computation (De Castro 2006). In these approaches, models of natural\nprocesses are used as a source of inspiration for the development of tools, techniques and technologies\nfor solving complex problems in various domains from engineering to biology. Those three approaches\nmay be classified according to the type of problems they attempt to deal with, among them: search,\nsimulation, and physical processing.\n\n4.1\n\nEarly research in Material-based Design Computation pioneered the consolidation of disciplines such as material science,\nengineering and computation in the context of design and design process. Computational processes have been identified that\nintegrate performance criteria with form-generation processes (Oxman, 2005; 2006; 2007 2008).\n\n100 DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\n4.2.1\n\nSearch and Optimization\n\nIn this approach, algorithms are developed which take inspiration from Nature with regard to, and\nwith the aim of, offering solutions for complex problems that cannot be otherwise solved using linear, non-linear and dynamic programming; the core idea here is to devise theoretical models which can\nbe implemented in computers with a focus on problem solving rather than theoretical modeling. Such\nbio-inspired, or biologically motivated, computing techniques are comprised of highly abstract models,\nsometimes called metaphors (Paton 1992), and are designed to mimic particular features and mechanisms\nfrom biology. Examples include artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, both of which are\ninformation processing systems for search and optimization inspired by models of the nervous system\nand evolutionary biology respectively with particular emphasis on problem solving. Ground-breaking\nwork in the area of neural networks was pioneered by McCulloch and Pitts in a paper entitled: “A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity” (McCulloch and Pitts 1943), which introduced\nthe first mathematical model of a neuron giving rise to the field of artificial neural networks (Kohonen\n1988; Fausett 1994; Haykin 1994; Bishop 1995). Evolutionary computation was pioneered in the mid\n1960’s with the works of I. Rechenberg, L. Fogel, A. Owens and JH Holland, and M. Walsh (Bck and\nSchwefel 1993; Fogel, Angeline et al. 1995; Frazer 1995; Spears 2000; Kallel, Naudts et al. 2001; Freitas 2002; Landweber, Winfree et al. 2002; Eiben and Smith 2003; Ghosh and Tsutsui 2003; Morrison\n2004; Tomassini 2005; Fogel 2006) giving rise to the field of evolutionary computing. Most evolutionary algorithms are rooted in the neo-Darwinian theory of evolution which proposes that a population of\nindividuals capable of reproducing and subject to genetic variation followed by natural selection result\nin new populations of individuals increasingly more fit to their environment. Evolutionary Algorithms\n(EAs), Swarm Intelligence and Artificial Immune Systems are also included within this category (De\nCastro 2006).\n4.2.2\n\nSimulation and Emulation\n\nThis approach includes the design of synthetic process aimed at creating patterns, forms, behaviors, and\norganisms that resemble life as we know it. With its products used to mimic various natural phenomena,\nit carries the potential of increasing our understanding of nature through computer models. De Castro\nspecifies two main sub-approaches to the simulation and emulation of nature in computers which include the application of Artificial Life techniques or by using tools for studying the fractal geometry\nof nature. Artificial life systems have been created to study traffic jams (Resnick 1993); the behavior\nof synthetic biological systems (Ray 1994) and the simulation of collective behaviors (Reynolds 1993)\namongst others. Its major concern is geared towards models of artificial life building life-like systems\nout of non-living parts.\n4.2.3\n\nComputing with Natural Materials\n\nThis approach corresponds to the use of natural materials to perform computation. It belongs to all\nnature-inspired hardware developments and thus it contributes to a truly novel computing paradigm that\nproposes to substitute, or supplement, current silicon-based computers. Computing with natural materials\nis geared towards new computing methods based on natural materials other than silicon. These methods\nresult in non-standard computation that overcomes some of the limitations of standard, sequential von\nNeumann computers. Since bio-electronic devices can reach dimensions that are over one hundred times\nsmaller than conventional silicon devices, bio-electronics can be harnessed for faster computer logic\ngates or light-activated switches (Forbes 2004). Given the assumption that any mathematical operation\ncan be broken down into bits, and any logical function can be built using an AND and a NOT gate, any\n\nFrom Computer Aided-Design to Design Computation: an Introduction 101\n\ncomputable entity can be worked out by appropriately wired AND and NOT gates. Such independence\nfrom a specific representational system makes it possible to use new concepts for computational processes based on natural materials such as chemical reactions, DNA molecules, and quantum mechanical\ndevices (De Castro 2006). Though still in its infancy, bio-electronics has the potential to provide significant advantages over traditional devices made with silicon. Design and construction of bio-electronics\nvia genetic engineering or chemical synthesis can afford a much greater degree of control (Forbes 2004).\nMuch related work is being carried out at MIT by Tom Knight, from MIT’s AI Lab and Neil Gershenfeld from MIT’s CBA4.2 . I have recently read that Knight was working on molecular scale assembly of\nintegrated circuits with the significant aim of programming bacteria in the same way a computer scientist\nmight program a microprocessor (Forbes 2004).\n\n4.2.4\n\nThe Problem with Natural Computation\n\nNatural computation processes provide the designer with a new look at the natural world as it provides\nher with new ways to explore and understand processes that lie at the heart of the natural world. The\nmain problem inherent in natural computing, however, remains its utilization in design through numeric\nand algorithmic techniques - merely for formalistic explorations that are, at times, divorced from realworld problems. In this light, one may often find that a network of leaf veins or the form of soap film\nis translated into building materials purely as geometrical forms, without necessarily understanding the\nstructural and material logic inherent in their manifestation.\n\n4.3\n4.3.1\n\nComputational Geometry 1: Synthesis without Analysis\nBackground: Problems and Issues\n\nDesign Computation aims to explore, develop and implement models of design generation (CAD), analysis (CAE) and fabrication (CAM) within the design process. Most of the important research carried out\nover the last decade and a half focuses on processes of parametric design based in associative geometry\nwhich are in most cases subjected to analysis, evaluation or optimization post the generation process\n(Figure 4.1).\nComputational Geometry is the study of algorithms generated to solve problems in terms of geometry\n(Shelden and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Architecture. 2002). The field was\ndeveloped parallel to advances in computer graphics and computer-aided design for purposes of data\nvisualization and materialization. Recent advancements in computational geometry coupled with the\nexpansion of CAD (computer-aided design) and CAE (computer-aided engineering) have expanded the\ndesigner’s computational palette.\nTraditional CAD applications typically allow for straightforward calculations of the absolute and relative location of features in Cartesian space. Such tools have now been expanded to include complex\ncomputational methods for non-Euclidian geometries such as B-Spline surfaces and NURBS curves4.3 .\nIn the following section problems associated with current approaches are raised and discussed.\n4.2\n\nCenter for Bits and Atoms, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nNon-Uniform Rational B-Splines, are mathematical representations of 3-D geometry that can accurately describe any\nshape from a simple 2-D line, circle, arc, or curve to the most complex 3-D organic free-form surface or solid. Because of their\nflexibility and accuracy, NURBS models can be used in any process from illustration and animation to manufacturing.\n4.3\n\n102 DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\n4.3.1.1\n\nThe Problem of Pre and Post Geometry\n\nAssuming a symbiotic relationship with geometry, design incorporates many issues that are independent\nof any specific formal configuration. These issues may be defined as the “parameter space” for a given\ndesign problem. Such “spaces” may be regarded as “pre-geometric” in nature; having arrived at a particular configuration, there exist potentially various alternative material interpretations of that particular\nconfiguration which may be regarded as “post-geometric” issues (Oxman 2007).\n4.3.1.2\n\nThe Problem of Synthesis-Analysis Cycles\n\nComputational geometry has customarily been used as a means for description and/or analysis of form.\nTo a lesser extent it has been made instrumental for purposes of design generation. Given the significance of such tools to the exploration of shape and form, the limitation remains the partitioning between\nmethodological models of description and models of, and for, generation. The integration of analytical\ntools and techniques as propositional rather than descriptive may potentially provide the user the capability to exploit work with computational geometry as a driver for the design process possessing integrated\nbuilt-in performance related considerations.\nThe main objective of this work, as a central prerequisite to a potential paradigm shift in generative\ndesign, is to promote a novel methodology which supports the seamless integration of geometry and performance. Multi-objective representation where geometrical entities (or forms of description) promote\nspeculations regarding the structural and/or environmental performance of the model endorses a design\nprocess that is generative in nature.\n4.3.1.3\n\nThe Problem of Optimization\n\nWith regards to digital processes informed by physical constraints, much work has been done in design\noptimization which links performance evaluation to an already existing design. Prior research has been\ncarried out which aims at assigning artificial intelligence to local discrete units such that each sub-domain\nmay optimize itself according to presubscribed fitness criteria (Hanna and Mahdavi 2004; Hanna 2006).\nUnder varied conditions of structural loading, each element as defined by the algorithm, modifies its\nthickness and orientation relative to local structural conditions. In micro structural scales, Haana perceives of an underlying repetitive modular system, the size of which correlates with that of the element\nsub-domain. Per a given element geometry, such changes occur as a response to environmental forces.\nCombined with Genetic Algorithms (GA’s) and Machine Learning algorithms, the elements modify their\ngeometrical and topological attributes. This research still lacks the incorporation of physical material\nproperties as potential variables affecting the general distribution of matter and local shape to cater for\nlocal forces(Hanna and Mahdavi 2004; Hanna 2006).\nEarlier research at MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering combines the GA approach with an\nobjective function such as strain energy to remove material where it is not needed (Shimada and Gossard\n1998). This line of work overlaps with the Shape Optimization approach where the shape is optimized\nfor optimal carrying of load. There are also “optimization” and work flow commercial packages such as\n“phoenix” and “insight” that can wrap the optimization code around the finite element simulation4.4 to\n4.4\nFinite Element methods are included within a wide range of structural analysis methods (analytical method, strength of\nmaterials classical method, elasticity method etc) used for performance analysis. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is an\nanalysis method primarily used within and across the engineering disciplines to allow for structural calculations of a given\nsolid or fluid element. The overall shape of this solid may be incredibly difficult to analyze; however, the discretization of such\nshapes significantly reduces mathematical and physical (behavioral) complexity. The method was developed in the early 1940’s\nby Alexander Hrennikoff and Richard Courant. Originating from the need for solving complex elasticity and structural analysis\n\nComputational Geometry 1: Synthesis without Analysis 103\n\ncarry out shape optimization.\nThis research calls for the elimination of procedural hierarchiess which may potentially exist between\n“pre” and “post” geometrical design operations (i.e. form-generation first, material and/or performance\nevaluation later) and offer a new methodology for the incorporation of material performance directly\nand explicitly into the geometric representation. Some innovative work along these lines has been carried\nout which argues that models for design exploration promoting different forms of design representation\nshould be bridged to support the discovery of novel designs (Kilian 2004).\nThe main objective of this work, as a central prerequisite to a potential paradigm shift in generative\ndesign, is to promote a novel methodology which supports the seamless integration of geometry and performance. Multi-objective representation where geometrical entities (or forms of description) promote\nspeculations regarding the structural and/or environmental performance of the model endorses a design\nprocess that is generative in nature. In order to achieve seamless processes new forms of representation\nare required. These are introduced below.\n4.3.2\n\nScalars, Vectors and Tensors: New Forms of Representation\n\nVarious mathematical qualities are made clearer employing visual tools and conceptual formulations\nrather than simply using numbers and functions. Visual learners frequently prefer the former method of\nelucidating such qualities. The concept of tensors is one such case, and given their considerable relevance\nto the understanding of material-based design computation, a rough illustration is provided below.\nNumerically expressed entities such as prices and forces may be characterized by mathematical objects\nincluding quantities and/or directions. Such objects are termed scalars and vectors respectively. A scalar\nquantity can be represented by a single number (e.g. temperature, weight, volume, time and so on).\nA vector quantity represents a set of three scalar quantities, or numbers, collectively referred to as a\nvector. Combined, they share the description of a quantity which contains descriptions of magnitude and\ndirection. Examples include force, velocity, acceleration, gradient of a scalar, and so on. All of these\nentities are described by some number and some direction indicating its path. In each of these cases,\nthree numbers must be used to fully describe the quantity at hand. A specific coordinate is selected\nfor describing a particular vector (Figure 4.2) such that if one chooses to describe a given force F in\nrectilinear coordinates, one would be required to specify the components of such force (Fx, Fy, Fz) for\neach of the three mutually perpendicular coordinates (Danielson and Noor 1997).\nTensors are geometric entities occupying the domains of mathematics and physics as they provide conceptual and technical extensions to scalars, vectors, and matrices. Multiple physical properties can be\nexpressed as correspondences between two or more sets of vectors. Stress, for instance, takes one vector as input and produces another vector as output such that an expression between physical input and\noutput is generated (Figure 4.3). It is due to their expressions of relationships between vectors, that tensors themselves are independent of a particular choice of a coordinate system. Furthermore, the tensor\nis a quality that obeys rules of tensor transformation. The coordinate-independent nature of the tensor\nmakes the tensor take the form of a “co-variant” transformation law, meaning it relates between arrays\ncomputed in a one coordinate system to other arrays, computed in another coordinate system. Each array\nproblems, the FEM offered a new approach promoting mesh discretization of a continuous domain (defined as the mathematical\ncharacterization of the analyzed object and/or environment) into a set of discrete sub-domains. Hrennikoff’s work discretizes\nthe domain by using a lattice analogy while Courant’s approach divides the domain into finite triangular sub regions. The\nmethod was provided with a rigorous mathematical foundation during the 70’s and has since been generalized into a branch\nof applied mathematics for numerical modeling of physical systems in a wide variety of engineering disciplines. In the field\nof structural mechanics, the FEM is often based on the virtual work energy principle or the minimum total potential energy\nprinciple which provides a general, intuitive and physical basis that has a great appeal to structural engineers.\n\n104 DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nis presented as a multi-dimensional matrix of numerical values. Elastic deformation and elastic stresses\nare examples of such tensors (Danielson and Noor 1997).\nEach of the three mutually perpendicular faces of the cube represent three stress components, which\ncollectively make up the tensor. Tensors have orders, or degrees, assigned to them which correspond to\nthe dimensionality of the arrays representing them. By logical extension, a scalar might be regarded as a\nzero ordered tensor (its magnitude is its sole component, so it can be represented as a zero dimensional\narray) and a vector a one-ordered tensor (the vector is represented in coordinates as a one dimensional\narray of components). By this logic, a 3 × 3 matrix is a second-order tensor (being represented in a\ntwo-dimensional array and so on).\nTensors are very useful mathematical objects in the domains of physics and engineering. The medical\nimaging industry for instance, has rapidly developed over the last decade with the growing interest in\nDiffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI). In diffusion tensor imaging for example,\nscans of the human brain are produced by expressing the differential permeability of organs to water\nin varying directions using tensor quantities. Tensors thus provide a powerful framework to model the\nanatomical variability of the brain. They are also widely used in mechanics, for example with strain or\nstress tensors, and are becoming a common tool in numerical analysis to generate adapted meshes to\nreduce the computational cost of solving partial differential equations (PDE’s) in 3D (Figure 4.4).\nDiffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging can be used to reconstruct whole heart geometry, as well as\nits fiber and laminar structure at a high resolution. In this technique, a tensor representing 3D diffusion\nof water in each image voxel is estimated such that it is aligned with the heart’s cardiac fiber structure. In\nthis way it is relatively easy to determine the occurrence of heart muscle disease (Helm, Beg et al. 2005).\nSeveral frameworks exist in which tensor computations can be converted into Euclidean ones as tensors\nare transformed into their matrix logarithms, which makes classical Euclidean processing particularly\nstraightforward to recycle.\n4.3.3\n\nTensors on Canvas: Towards the Physical Representation of Material Properties\n\nMost surface and solid modelers are achieved by using boundary representations such that the definition\nof 3-D form is the result of some preconceived boundary condition (Oxman 2007). Such forms are then\ncreated, edited and optimized using high-level constructive methods that rely on parameterized Boolean\nset operations and feature-based techniques (Biswas, Shapiro et al. 2004). Downstream applications\noften require optimization of integral-valued performance measures over such models that include volume, mass, and energy properties, as well as more general distributed fields (stress, temperature, etc.)4.5 .\nSuch properties, coupled with additional geometrical data may potentially be incorporated into the formgeneration process so as to support the description of form as material substance using tensor indices.\nSeldom is the architect driven by the need or by the desire to develop a design using tensors. This is\npartly due to the fact that tensor math is simply too hard to handle; but it is mostly due to their role as\nanalytical functions that their generative potential in the field of architectural design has hardly been\nconsidered.\nCurrently, the design space of the architect includes the three dimensions of space (x, y and z). Cartesian\nspace in 3D environments is the architect’s canvas as every point in any given position may be described\nby its location in Euclidean space using those three coordinates. Such forms of representation appear to\nbe sufficient for the architect who is traditionally engaged with geometrical manipulation as her means\nfor both deriving and describing form. Physics and its analytics are left for the engineer, and any property\nto be optimized or simulated must first be explicated as an expression in 3D space.\n4.5\nA key computational utility in all such applications is the computation of the sensitivity of the performance measure with\nrespect to the parameters in the solid’s construction history (Biswas, 2004).\n\nComputational Geometry 1: Synthesis without Analysis 105\n\nConsider, however, the extension of Cartesian space to include the physical dimensions of matter and\nenergy. In this thesis it is proposed that the geometric representation of form is not sufficient when considering material properties and their physical interaction with the environment. These aspects of the\ndesign process are frequently left for the structural or environmental engineer to analyze and predict.\nThis introduces the following question: what if, instead of designing form with its physical properties\nemerging as byproducts of analysis and optimization, we would be designing directly with form’s properties such that form itself would emerge as a tensor field informed by such constraints as thermal and\nmechanical conditions?\n4.3.4\n\nPoints, Lines, Surfaces, Solids and Galaxies: The Problem of Hierarchies\n\nLearning CAD is not unlike learning a new programming language: “you know one, you know them\nall”. Occupying the designer’s digital canvas is the world of geometry, governed by an eminent universal\ncoordinate system (CS) referencing the (0, 0, 0) point for each new creation. Drop down menus containing functions, methods and various shape-generating tools accompany the main window into which\nnew forms are drawn (yes drawn!) as points combine to create lines and as curves are lofted to create\nthree-dimensional surfaces.\nIn this Euclidian universe, each point making up the design includes X, Y and Z values corresponding\nwith its universal location relative to the CS. Things become straightforward once one has arrived at\nan understanding of the hierarchies of geometrically driven design. Points make lines (or curves), lines\nmake surfaces, and surfaces make solids. While such representations of space suffice for basic Euclidean\nprimitives, representation becomes challenging for more complicated spatial elements.\nIn the natural world, the generation of form appears to typically skip the steps required by the designer:\nlines and zero-thickness surfaces are too intricate to trace or, rather, such entities barely exist in nature.\nThe physical world may well be described and reconstructed by the decree and the dictate of geometry,\nbut there is more to shape than shape itself. Consider, for instance, the creation of bone tissue. Lines\nor curves would not suffice in the description or formulation of the tissue as a function of the changing\nloads it carries. The same applies for the growth of trees or the formation of muscle tissue and so on.\n4.3.5\n\nMaterial-assigned Geometry vs. Geometry-assigned Material\n\nFew treatises in the field of architectural design computation have been devoted to the topic of physical\nrepresentation through digital tools. Certainly, Dennis Sheldon’s work entitled “Digital Surface Representation and the Constructability of Gehry’s Architecture” (Shelden and Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology. Dept. of Architecture. 2002) holds relevance and is well-deserved of inclusion in this review. In his thesis, Sheldon presents work devoted to the development of computational tools describing\nGehry’s architectural forms with special focus on the digital representation of surface geometry and its\ncapacity for describing constructability. Sheldon’s objects of inquiry, much in-line with Gehry’s design\nlanguage, are surface materials such as paper and sheet metal. All the while, Sheldon is interested in\nthe relationship between geometry and constructability. Subsequently, with an already existing formal\nexpression, Sheldon successfully develops “generative strategies for the rationalization of surface form\ninto constructible configurations” (Shelden and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Architecture. 2002). The generation of form is beside the point here; as a result, the role of materials occupies\nthe scope of construction and materialization rather that of form-generation.\nIn this context however, it is essential to differentiate Sheldon’s approach to the role of materials from\nthe one presented here. To Gehry, as to Sheldon, the role of materials predominantly (and stylistically)\nrestricted to the class of paper-like surface structures lies in their capability to describe geometry. In\n\n106 DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nother words, in Sheldon’s case, material is assigned to geometry. By contrast, it is here proposed that\ngeometrical representations can potentially result from material properties and processes.\nFor Sheldon, as most naturally for Gehry himself as chief architect, the success of any computational\ntool is determined by its ability to seemingly trace the physical object, while any discrepancies between\nthe digital and physical domains are attributed to descriptive failure. Tight conformance between the\nphysical object (and it’s already agreed upon form) and its digital portrayal is central to the role of\ncomputational process as assistive to the construction process.\nDespite Sheldon’s concern with the final stages of the design process (namely construction and materialization), its relevance to us lies in computational routines that occupy the space between the digital and\nthe physical renditions of form.\nSheldon asserts: “The digital constructs of curved surfaces do not in themselves exhibit any affinity with\nthe behaviors and characteristics of project materials” (Shelden and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Architecture. 2002). In other words, contrasting the robust alignment between rigid sheet\nmaterials and planar geometries, there typically exist little or no NURBS surface nets to describe Gehry’s\nforms. This is peculiar, particularly considering that the impetus behind the early development of spline\nmathematics which was in fact developed to approximate the physically founded behavior of ship splines\n(Pottmann and Farin 1995; Shelden and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Architecture.\n2002). In this process, thin metal strips were used in the delineation of ship hull forms, whose curvature was generated by materials bending, and only loosely approximated the corresponding bending of\nwooden laths on the ship hull. Meanwhile, it seems that the development of digital curved surface representation has diverged from this original material nature to one more reductive and abstract, guided by\nthe feasibility of operations on the mathematical formulations themselves. Paper-like shapes, that are the\ncentral focus of Sheldon’s line of inquiry, lie in-between the “highly constrained class of planar geometries and the general class of curved surface forms” (Shelden and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nDept. of Architecture. 2002). Moreover, surface modeling techniques may impose constraints on the\ndigital surface forms that differ from those of physical prototypes and their fabricated counterparts. Either way, the dichotomy between physical objects and their descriptive digital counterparts appears to\nbe as challenging today as it has been throughout the brief history of digital design. Such a dichotomy\nemphasizes, yet again, that form generation processes may belong to one out of two potential classes:\nthe first class being digital form-generation followed by physical fabrication, and the second class being\nphysical form-generation, described, analyzed and simulated in the digital domain prior to construction.\nIn both classes, material appears to be consistently secondary to geometry.\n4.4\n\nComputational Geometry 2: Analysis-driven Synthesis through Tessellation\n\nFrom natural objects to manmade artifacts, tiling is all around us: it is the act of rationalizing highly\ncomplex form by breaking it up into smaller, continuous components. If well pursued, tiled objects can\nbe easily designed and assembled. However, a geometric-centric view of tiling, whereby a predefined\nform determines the shape, size, and organization of tiles, has prejudiced the evolution of the field of\ndigital design.\nPrecedents pointing towards Material-based Tiling exist mostly as procedural protocols written for the\nanalysis and optimization of form after it has been generated. Such computational research is generally\nfound in the areas of optimization and visualization (DeHaemer Jr and Zyda 1991) and focuses on issues\nof shape interpolation, namely, on the development of robust methods for connecting new vertices over\ngiven surface representations, and on methods for smoothly interpolating between models that represent\nthe same object at different levels of detail (Turk 1992). The key notion is that of a re-tiling procedure\nthat involves the creation of intermediate models, called the mutual tessellation of a surface, that contain\n\nComputational Geometry 2: Analysis-driven Synthesis through Tessellation 107\n\nboth the vertices from the original model and the new points that are to become vertices in the re-tiled\nsurface (Turk 1992).\nRelated work in computer science and visualization includes vector-field visualization and segmentation\nusing centroidal Voronoi tessellation (Du and Wang 2004). In this method, the generators of the Voronoi\nregions in the tessellation are also the centers of mass with respect to a prescribed density. A distance\nfunction in spatial and vector spaces is developed to measure the similarity of spatially distributed vector\nfields. In this case, the tessellation assists in the analysis, simplification, and visualization of an existing\nmaterial substance and its related vector fields. The method offers the generation of tessellated patterns\na-priori or in parallel to form generation such that geometrical properties inform physical attributes and\nvice versa.\nSpecialists in the field of computer science had previously reviewed a large body of literature on automatic mesh generation for use in Finite Element techniques(Ho-Le 1988). In most of the cases examined,\nthe aim was to subdivide the surface area or volume of a given object to provide a mesh over which some\nphysical properties of the material, such as heat dissipation, could be simulated. Here, once more, the\napplication of physical properties is applied for the purpose of analysis rather than the synthesis of form.\nThe field of computational geometry has also seen a good amount of work dedicated to tiling problems\n(Du and Wang 2004). Specifically, the properties of Voronoi regions and the associated Delaunay triangulation are relevant to establishing heterogeneous sizing hierarchies between triangular elements in the\ndepiction of highly complex 3-D form (De Floriani 1989).\nDigital design as a whole has experienced a renaissance in tiling through advancements in computational geometry and implementation of associative modeling strategies in design (Kaijima and Michalatos 2008). However, the question of how to extend the function of tiling beyond its role as a postrationalizing strategy in the geometrical domain remains ill-developed.\nI propose four discrete approaches to surface tessellation, defined by the guiding content for the tessellation. Such classification includes curvature-based tessellation, performance-based tessellation, assemblybased tessellation, and material-based tessellation.\n4.4.1\n\nCurvature-based Tessellation\n\nCurvature-based tessellations are tessellations informed by the geometrical features of the surface. Examples include the transformation of polygonal-size variation as a function of the type and degree of\ncurvature: smaller polygons are allocated in regions of high curvature, whereas larger cells are allocated\nin regions of low curvature (Figure 4.5).\n4.4.2\n\nPerformance-based Tessellation\n\nPerformance-based tessellations are tessellations informed by a set of governing performance criteria\nsuch as the type and magnitude of mechanical loads or heat flux. In this case, the variation of cell size\nand density is a function of force vectors that emulate the magnitude and direction of the structural load.\nGeometrical features on the hosting surface demonstrate such functions. For instance, smaller polygons\nare allocated in regions of higher stress in order to increase the surface area that connects the elements,\nand larger polygons are allocated in regions of lower stress.\n4.4.3\n\nAssembly-based Tessellation\n\nFabrication constraints define assembly-based tessellation: in the case of repetitive fabrication, in which\nthe size of each polygon edge is equal to all others, the polygonal tiling would be symmetrical across all\n\n108 DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\ndirections. In other cases, the number of discrete measurements defined by the logic of assembly informs\ncell size and distribution.\n\nComputational Geometry 2: Analysis-driven Synthesis through Tessellation 109\n\n4.4.4\n\nMaterial-based Tessellation\n\nMaterial-based tessellation assigns physical features to geometrical entities such as stress, strain, temperature flux, etc. In this case, mechanical material properties govern the relative form, size, and density\nof the cells. This class is different from all other classes4.6 as it relates to the substance of the surface as\na heterogeneous curvature domain. The location of a finite set of heterogeneities, defined by mechanical\nbehavior, informs the tessellation. Each heterogeneous group has a polygon, or a group of polygons,\nassociated with it. The mechanical properties as defined by the user, inform the spatial distribution of\nheterogeneities.\n4.5\n\nComputational Geometry 3: Analysis-driven Synthesis through Finite Element Methods\n\nThe following section presents the theoretical basis that can potentially support design that is driven by\nmaterial properties. It introduces concepts related to the microstructure of materials and their relevance\nto design. A novel object-oriented finite element analysis method is presented and discussed which is\nrelevant to the development of Material-based Design Computation.\n4.5.1\n\nThe Promise of Reductive Approach to Physical Modeling\n\nLike fingerprints, the structures of materials tell the story of their growth (by natural or artificial processes) and form (behavior). A composition of polycrystalline grains, second phases, cracks, pores,\nand various other features occurring on length scales that are large when compared to atomic sizes, the\nmicro-structure of materials represents an intricate design (Carter, Langer et al. 1998; WC 2001; Carter\n2010).\nSimply put, an Object Oriented Finite Element approach to microstructures is designed to answer questions regarding the prediction of material behavior when forces of various types and magnitude are\napplied. In this way, the material scientist for whom the program is intended may visualize the location\nof stress and its distribution relative to “external” manipulation (such as temperature or load increase).\nThe typical, widely accepted approach for examining micro-structural behavior is based on the abstraction and reduction of a material sample from which a model is formulated to explain and predict its\nbehavior. The advantages of such a reductive approach are clear: it facilitates a general case which\nmay be repeatedly applied on, and refined by, cases of similar conditions; it simplifies and reduces the\nrepresentation of complex structures into a finite pool of parameters. This defines a pilot case against\nwhich similar cases may be compared. For example, any given microstructure may be characterized by\nits grain size or porosity. Such parameters typically defer between one sample and the other, hence once\ngeneralized, some information is lost which may otherwise hold significant relevance for a particular\ncase. As useful as reductive models may be, given their predictable nature, such information may be\ncrucial for the design process. In other words, it is when physical properties depend on micro-structural\nparticulars (such as the spatial correlation of crystallite orientation, the shapes and dispersion of second\n4.6\n\nNaturally, there could also be combinations of the classifications above, whereby a polygonal map, for instance, is defined\nby both the surface’s curvature degree and its assembly logic. Mathematically, we know of three regular tessellations composed\nof regular polygons that can symmetrically tile a plane. Tessellations of the plane by two or more convex regular polygons, such\nthat the same polygons in the same order surround each polygon vertex, are called semi-regular tessellations, or sometimes,\nArchimedean tessellations. In the plane, there are eight such tessellations. Simple and relatively known examples of surface\ntessellation are square and hexagonal tiling. Examples that are more complex include Penrose tiling; randomly colored, uniform\npolygon tiles; or hexagons and pentagons that compose a Buckminster sphere. In Chapter 4 we have distinguished between\ntiling of regular polygons (in 2-D), polyhedrals (in 3-D) and polytopes (for n dimensions).\n\n110 DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nphases, extreme figures of statistical distributions, local anisotropies and so on), that such a reductive\napproach is often futile (Carter, Langer et al. 1998; WC 2001; Carter 2010).\n4.5.2\n\nObject Oriented Finite Element Analysis (OOF) as Case Study\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum lies a non-reductive approach promoted by object-oriented methods.\nSuch methods are unique in treating any microstructure as a special case devoid of the need to reduce\nany details characteristic of its behavior.\nOOF (Object Oriented Finite Element Method) for Materials Science and Engineering is designed to\nsimulate and predict the physical and mechanical macroscopic properties of complex materials microstructures. The code allows the designer to map material micro-structures onto finite element meshes\nin order to calculate local stress states, thermal behavior and so on. An integrated computational environment for multi-scale materials design, OOF is extendible to a range of problems such as elasticity,\nplasticity, thermal conductivity, and mass diffusion (Carter, Langer et al. 1998; WC 2001; Carter 2010).\nSupported by the U.S Department of Energy, the development of OOF was led by Craig Carter (Department of Materials Science and Engineering, MIT), Ed Fuller, Andy Roosen and Stephen Langer\n(Information Tech. Lab, National Institute of Standards and Technology).\nCommercial FE packages are frequently developed for, and applied to, large scale structural systems\nwith regularly shaped components. Alternatively, systems of materials and their micro-structures are\nsmall scale and disordered. In the OOF environment, physics and Finite Element class structure are\nmore closely tied to the underlying mathematics as well as allowing more physics and more types of\nfinite elements (Carter, Langer et al. 1998; WC 2001; Carter 2010).\nOOF is a Finite-Element Method based application designed from a materials science (rather than structural design) perspective. The motivation for its development was driven by the need to include, demonstrate, and utilize the role of heterogeneous, stochastic micro-structures on bulk physical properties and\nmicro-structural damage propagation. As a result, the physical properties of materials can now be correlated with their various micro-structures in the process of design to shorten the materials development\ncycle, to improve material properties and their related processing and to promote design processes that\nare more reliable.\nThe core approach was guided by the need to develop computational tools for simulating multifunctional properties as well as clarifying and demonstrating the influences of stochastic, anisotropic microstructural features on the physical properties of materials.\nThe reductive, as-is knowledge of the physical and mechanical properties of multifunctional materials\nappears to be essential to their reliability as the substance from which design components are made.\nNot unlike fingerprints, no component is precisely the same as another when manufactured using natural materials. Such property measurements however are tremendously time-consuming and expertisedependent. Furthermore, many measurements are essential in order to qualify new materials. Consequently, the development cycle for the design and validation of new materials has not yet caught up\nwith the development cycle of structural components. Computational tools, such as OOF promote the\nshortening of material and process development without compromising diagnostic accuracy4.7 .\n4.7\n\nCurrent capabilities include: modifying images, selecting pixels, assigning material properties to pixels, creating unstructured 2-D triangular meshes, adapting meshes to material boundaries (refining elements, moving edges, swapping edges),\ndefining element and pixel groups, defining “active areas” to localize operations. Other capabilities include: solving unstructured 2-D triangular meshes, linear elasticity with thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, any crystal symmetry (isotropic,\nhexagonal etc), plane stress or plane strain, simple models of fracture, designer elements, boundary conditions (such as: fixed\ndisplacement, temperature, free, constrained motion, any combination of the above), distortions (applied displacement, temperature, applied force, heat flux), mesh creation (unstructured mesh, generative uniform mesh, modify material properties of\nexisting mesh), output: maps of stress, strain, temperature, energy density), statistics of stress, strain etc for a whole mesh or\n\nComputational Geometry 3: Analysis-driven Synthesis through Finite Element Methods 111\n\n4.5.3\n\nOOF: the Computational Process as Applied to Design\n\nThe computational process is based on an already existing digitized image of some micro-structure on\ntop of which a data structure is then computed. Tools provide the user with the ability to graphically\nselect features in the micro structural image and specify their properties such that the micro-structural\ndata is composed of the visual image coupled with property data.\nVirtual experiments simulating the material’s behavior under various forms of loadings are then performed, visualized and quantified. A mesh is then fitted to pixel boundaries with the aim of minimizing\n(i.e. reducing) an energy function of the mesh, E (Figure 4.6, 4.7).\nE = (1 − α)Eshape + αEhomogeneity)\nThe set of operations applied to reduce the energy function of the mesh thus include fitting the mesh\nto pixel boundaries, generating the initial coarse mesh, refining the mesh’s elements, applying a Monte\nCarlo method for node motion and edge swapping, and finally generating the final mesh (Carter, Langer\net al. 1998; WC 2001; Carter 2010).\nFurther than its function as a materials computation and simulation environment, OOF turns out to be\nextremely useful in predicting thermal conductivity as in the design of material coatings and thermal\nbarriers. In this case, OOF allows for the prediction of the thermal conductivity of a ceramic thermal\nbarrier coating for a turbine blade which, when properly designed, will allow jet engine blades to operate\nat higher temperatures (Carter, Langer et al. 1998; WC 2001; Carter 2010).\nOOF’s framework serves as an exemplar of a non-reductionist approach to analysis-driven design. It\ndoes so by creating models of behavior prediction based on real-world cases that are more efficient and\neffective than prior approaches by excluding abstract modeling and simplification. Research into imagedriven calculations is not a new idea (Edward Garboczi and colleagues at NIST have used this approach\nto investigate the behavior of cements and porous media, while researchers at Alcoa have developed\nfinite element models of textured materials); however, its implementation as an open domain software,\nproviding generic tools for calculating micro-structure-property relations is of great significance in the\nfield of Materials Science and Engineering. Current limitations appear to relate to the need to model\nthree-dimensional microstructure, a restriction currently being addressed by the team at NIST and MIT\n(Carter, Langer et al. 1998; WC 2001; Carter 2010).\n4.6\n4.6.1\n\nFinite Element Methods: Problems and Issues in Design Applications\nBackground\n\nEvolution is to nature what optimization processes are to the designer. Implemented across the fields of\nmathematics and computer science, the term optimization and its many manifestations refer to processes\nof solution refinement and guided choice. In the simplest, most elementary cases, optimization processes\nsolve problems in which one seeks to minimize or maximize some function by systematically searching\nand choosing values that fit a given pool of constraints. Such is demonstrated by the Finite Element\nMethod in the milieu of engineering and structural optimization. The Finite Element Method (FEM), also\nreferred to as Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is defined as a numerical technique for finding numerically\nstable approximate solutions by eliminating ones that do not fit the domain of the objective function. The\nobjective function is defined as the function determining the objective of a given optimization process\nelement group, plot of stress, strain, etc along a cross section, stress, strain, etc at selected elements, forces at selected nodes,\ncontrolled from graphical user interface or script menu driven, commands in tree of submenus (Carter, Langer et al. 1998; WC\n2001; Carter 2010).\n\n112 DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nwhich is also considered the function to be maximized or minimized in optimization theory. Various\ntechniques are used as mathematical procedures for solving the equations defined by the FEM. They are\nalso known as explicit methods for numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and include\nEuler’s method as well as the Runge-Kutta method (Reddy 1984; Reddy 1984).\nThe Finite Element Method was developed by Alexander Hrennikof (1941) and Richard Courant (1942)\nand was motivated by the need for solving complex elasticity and structural analysis problems in civil\nand aeronautical engineering. Other approaches also exist which all share one essential characteristic of\nmesh discretization. Mesh discretization allows the designer to subdivide a continuous mathematical domain into a set of discrete sub-domains referred to as elements. Lattices and triangulation are offered by\nHrennikof and Courant respectively (Reddy 1984; Reddy 1984). The engineering disciplines (mechanical, aeronautical, biomechanical, and automotive industries) frequently implement the method in the\ndesign and development of products. In addition to structural analysis capabilities, contemporary applications now include working environments for thermal, electromagnetic, and fluid simulation problems.\nIn the context of structural design and optimization, the method offers the designer the ability to increase\nstiffness and strength as well as to minimize weight, cost and optimize material selection. Detailed visualizations indicating the distribution of stresses and displacements aid the designer in determining where\nstructures bend, twist or buckle. Finally, FEM software provides for a vast range of simulation options\nfor controlling the complexities involved in the analysis of structural and environmental performances.\nOver the last decade, further applications have emerged that examine the relation between search and\nchoice by combining the Finite Element Method with other computational approaches already reviewed\nin this section, such as Genetic Algorithms (GA-FEM). In offering efficient search algorithms, GA-FEM\napproaches have proved successful in resolving complex structural problems (Hojjat Adeli 1993).\n4.6.2\n\nFinite Element Methods: Problems and Issues in Design Applications\n\nThe amalgamation of computer-aided design (CAD) tools and the finite element method (FEM) has\ngreatly enhanced the engineer’s ability to evaluate potential designs (Camacho, Hopper et al. 1997). For\nthe designer, however, analysis unaided by synthesis appears to restrict the design space and limit possibilities for formal manipulation. Consequently, shape optimization methods have become increasingly\npopular, particularly for problems of structural design (Yang and Chuang 1994). However, for shape optimization methods to be fully accepted by the design community they must first be integrated with CAD\nsystems that afford and promote formal operations. In particular, the challenge central to the integration\nof CAD and shape optimization methods appears to be the inability to conform the finite element nodal\ncoordinates to the CAD solid model dimensions.\nSome feature-based modeling environments have been developed that respond to such challenges using\nfeature-based representations over-ruling the need to work directly with geometrical representations and\ninstead operating on individual features defining these geometries (Chen, Freytag et al. 2008).\nRelated state of the art research at MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering combines the GA\napproach with an objective function such as strain energy to remove material where it is not needed (Shimada and Gossard 1998). This line of work overlaps with the Shape Optimization approach where the\nshape is optimized for optimal carrying of load. There are also “optimization” and work flow commercial\npackages such as “Phoenix” and “Insight” that can wrap the optimization code around the finite element\nsimulation to carry out shape optimization.\n\nFinite Element Methods: Problems and Issues in Design Applications 113\n\n4.6.3\n\nNature Inspired Finite Element Methods\n\nIn the field of architecture, prior research has been carried out which aims to assign artificial intelligence\nto local discrete units such that each sub-domain may optimize itself according to presubscribed fitness\ncriteria (Hanna and Mahdavi 2004; Hanna 2006). Under varied conditions of structural loading, each\nelement as defined by the algorithm, modifies its thickness and orientation relative to local structural\nconditions. In micro-structural scales, Haana perceives of an underlying repetitive modular system, the\nsize of which correlates with that of the element sub-domain. Per a given element geometry, such changes\noccur as a response to environmental forces. Combined with Genetic Algorithms (GA’s) and Machine\nLearning algorithms, the elements modify their geometrical and topological attributes. This research\nstill lacks the incorporation of physical material properties as potential variables affecting the general\ndistribution of matter and local shape to cater for local forces.\nStructural optimization is typically handled by iterative methods repeatedly computing a given model\nwhich includes physical parameters regarding its material composition and mechanical durability. Given\na parameterized component along with a set of loading conditions, various optimization algorithms can\nbe used to design effective shapes to counter a given load. Search procedures including gradient descent\n(GD) and genetic algorithms (GA) make repeated evaluations of the strength of different structures to\ndo this (Hanna and Mahdavi 2004; Hanna 2006). The optimal structure will change under changing\nconditions of load as a new shape emerges. A structural component under complex loading conditions\nexhibits differing stresses at various points across its volume. If these stresses are sampled at the location\nof one of the unit cubes, they can be used to optimize the module of structure within that cube. The vector\nof stresses in the three (x, y and z) axes represents a loading condition for the structure in that cube, and\nfor each stress vector there is an optimal set of node point positions and strut thicknesses to best resist\nthat load. Both genetic algorithms and gradient descent (Hanna and Mahdavi 2004; Hanna 2006) have\nbeen used to find this optimal, using the finite element method to simulate the effects of loading.\n4.7\n4.7.1\n\nSoft-Kill Optimization: Towards Biomimetic Design\nBackground and Relevance\n\nSimilar advancements in optimization have been developed in the field of Biomimetics as engineers\nreveal Nature’s unique capacities for the design and optimization of its products. Within this scope, significant work has been carried out by Prof. Claus Mattheck, director of the Research Center at Karlsruhe.\nMattheck embarked on the mission of simulating knot healing processes in trees. Knots are usually attributed to dormant buds or cut side branches and are generally considered as imperfections in the wood\nwhich greatly affect its mechanical properties.\nTaking an in inspiration from Nature, Mattheck’s aim was to develop processes to mimic growth and refinement and further implement them as computational routines in the field of shape optimization. More\nspecifically, the task is to shape any given object so that it may be as light as possible without compromising its durability. In this process, both the external shape and its internal composition are modulated\nin a subtractive manner. In other words, the process of optimization is based on reducing access matter in\nspecific locations that do not act as load bearing regions. Holes and recesses are incorporated in regions\nof unloaded zones. The following steps describe this optimization process which has been termed Soft\nKill Optimization (SKO).\n\n114 DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\n4.7.2\n\nComputational Routines\n\n1. A rough design draft is created for the desired form. Its external dimensions are set not to exceed\nthe limits prescribed by the following function and are therefore preferably larger than smaller.\nThis goes in line with the subtraction method: material can be eliminated, but not added i.e. the\ndesign draft may be continuously reduced, but not enlarged. A finite element mesh is then applied\nto the draft and the initial optimization process begins (Figure 4.8).\n2. The initial elastic finite element analysis calculation is carried out taking into account the working\nload expected in service along with any presubscribed supports, restraints and guides, all of which\nwill affect the distribution of stresses in the component. Mises reference stress4.8 is generally also\nincluded in this initial calculation. In special cases, the normal principle stress s is also included.\n3. In this step the local elastic modulus is set much larger than the stress calculated at any particular\nplace (E \u001d σ). As a result, the more highly loaded zones become harder occupying more elements per more surface area, and the less loaded zones become softer, occupying fewer elements\nper less surface area. Interestingly, the initial homogenized material emerges as non-homogeneous\nas regions of stiff and soft matter appear. The new component may now characterized by its Emodulus variation across the initially uniform finite element mesh which was assigned to it in the\nvery first step.\n4. Given the newly defined non-homogeneous structure, a new finite-element stress calculation is\ncarried out in which the load bearing zones of the component now carry even less load. This\ncauses a sharper contouring of the entire structure. Steps 2 and 3 are reapplied repeatedly as the\nstresses in the non-load bearing zone bellow a certain minimum value are set at zero. The iteration\nmethod terminates when there is no longer visually and mechanically significant change in the\ncomponent design.\nSuch automated process for the mechanically informed shaping of a structural component has generated\na design perfectly fit to suit its structural requirements. The draft is predicted based on material constraints mapped to the actual load bearing locations in which the value of the modulus of elasticity vary\nlocally. The overall modulus reappears as constant as the overall material has transitioned to its original\nhomogeneous state. This pre-optimized light weight design may still require additional optimization routines in which areas remaining under loaded are shrunk away and notch stresses are reduced. The SKO\nmethod may be executed using local or global increment methods. The size of the increments refers to\nthe amount of material being subtracted from the component per iteration, relative to the component’s\noverall size.\n4.7.3\n\nStress Increment Control Methods\n\nThe increment control method allows for further refinement of the structural component following the\nimplementation of the SKO method. The first run of this procedure appears to be identical to the initiating\nstep described in the stress controlled method (“step 1”). In the following iteration steps the calculated\n4.8\nVon Mises is a criteria used in predicting the onset of yield in ductile materials. The von Mises stress/equivalent\nstress/distortional strain energy is given by the relation:\n\nσeq =\n\np\np\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nI12 − 3I2 = σ11\n+ σ22\n+ σ33\n− σ11 σ22 − σ22 σ33 − σ33 σ11 + 3σ12\n+ 3σ23\n+ 3σ31\n\nSoft-Kill Optimization: Towards Biomimetic Design 115\n\nstress is no longer set equal to the local E-modulus, but rather to the local stress increment i.e. the\n(n) − th to the (n + 1) − th FEM run is set equal to one increment of the E-modulus such that:\n∆σ = ∆E\nPrior to any further run, this increment is then added to the existing E-modulus distribution such that:\nEn+1 = En + ∆σn\nThe newly defined E-modulus distribution now allows for repeated iterations to compute which will\neventually eliminate any remaining non-load bearing zones in the design draft. The main advantage\nbehind the local increment method is its rapid effectiveness even with when computed using relatively\nvery few iterations. The disadvantage of the method lies in its potential to produce porous structures that\nare very challenging to compute and complicated to manufacture. To resolve this problematic, a global\nstress-increment controlled method was proposed by Dr Lothar Harzheim which results in fewer holes\nand notches in the final design draft.\n4.7.4\n\nSummary\n\nThe SKO method initiates by setting the initial approximate limiting dimensions (“bounding box”) of the\ncomponent. External loads are then applied as well as any limiting conditions such as clamping, support\nand guides. The FEM numerical tool is then applied to derive the calculations for stress and strain\ndisplacements in the component. Following the FEM application, the SKO method is then applied with\nthe aim of eliminating any non load-bearing zones as it delivers a pre optimized light weight design draft.\nAny remaining notch stresses are then removed by the application of the CAIO (Computer Aided Internal\nOptimization) method. With Notch stresses are reduced by simulating biological growth facilitated by\nthe removal of notches by shrinking any still remaining non-load bearing zones. The combination of\nFEM, SKO and CAO promotes the realization of the axiom of uniform stress and create durable and\nultra lightweight components with maximum durability.\nTo summarize, the removal of low stress regions using evolutionary structural optimization is made\npossible by the trio of several methods developed by Mattheck and his team. The steps required for both\nexternal (-shape) and internal (-material) optimization include the following routines:\n• Computer Aided Optimization (CAO) methods such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) previously described for the initial analysis of the component and the application of a FE mesh on\nwhich to perform further computation.\n• Soft Kill Optimization (SKO) method for reduction of material substance corresponding to regions\nof high and low load.\n• Computer Aided Internal Optimization (CAIO) for shaping holes and openings to correspond to\nthe force trajectories applied on the homogeneous material.\n4.8\n\nThe Element: the Discretization Technique as applied in FEM\n\nA discretization technique is used in FEM in order to subdivide any given mathematical domain into\na series of smaller regions within which equations are approximately solved. The determination of\nanticipated mechanical behaviors over the entire domain is determined by assembling sets of equations\nfor each region, also known as an element. Multiple elements are connected between them through nodes\n\n116 DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nmaking up a continuous mesh describing the surface area of the object. Common boundaries of adjacent\nelements within the mesh allow a continuous solution to be applied within the domain.\nSolutions are determined per element and assembled to predict the overall functional behavior of the\nstructural part. This process is achieved by measuring the displacement of elements at the nodes when\nload is simulated. Solutions are determined in terms of discrete values representing the displacements\nper each node (e.g. displacements in x, y and z directions). The degree of freedom at a given node is\ndefined by the number of unknown primary field variables. The solution for the overall domain emerges\nas a piecewise approximation, expressed in terms of nodal values.\nStrain is defined as the measure of the relative deformation of the solid body. In a Cartesian system,\nthe components of strain are calculated as functions (“strain displacement equations”) of the u, v and\nw displacement components. The normal strains Σx, Σy, and Σz are defined as the unit elongation of\nthe body at a point in the direction of the respective x, y and z coordinate axes4.9 . The shearing strains\nmeasure the distortion of the angle between the various planes. Additional material properties, such as\npiezoelectric properties can be included by additional terms in the stress-strain relationship equations.\nFor a given displacement function computed by FEM, strains can be calculated throughout the body\nfrom which stresses are derived using constitutive laws4.10 . Clearly, an infinite number of geometrically\npossible displacement functions exist for a given object but only a singular unique displacement function\nwill physically describe the deformation due to a set of forces and satisfy the equilibrium of forces. This\nunique function is determined according to the principle of minimum potential energy4.11 .\n4.8.1\n\nShape Optimization vs. Topological Optimization\n\nIt is no surprise that most of the advancements in computational modeling and analysis have developed in\nthe related disciplines of structural design and engineering. This is perhaps due to the fact that once form\nis provided, there are many ways of going about its evaluation and assessment in regard to its functional\npurpose. Such evaluation routines belong to the field of shape optimization. Problems typical to this field\ninclude finding shapes which are optimal in that they minimize a certain functional while satisfying given\nconstrains. In many such cases, the functional being solved depends on the variable domain4.12 . By logical extension to problems of shape optimization, problems of topology optimization are concerned with\nthe number of connected components, or boundaries, belonging to the domain. Topological optimization\ntechniques can assist working around the limitations of shape optimization problems which must have,\nby definition, fixed topological properties (such as a fixed number of holes in them).\n4.8.2\n\nOptimization Methods and their Relevance to Form-Generation\n\nProblems relating to shape and topological optimization are of incredible relevance to the designer using\nperformance-oriented modeling and analysis methods due to their ability to parametrically link formal\nconstraints to functional ones. Once generated, the modeled form can be modified geometrically or\ntopologically according to any functional limitations defined by the designer and/or by the environment.\n4.9\n\nThe strain is relative to some initial length\nConstitutive equations are used to relate between two physical quantities (often described by tensors) that are specific to\na material or substance, and approximates the response of that material to external forces. It is combined with other equations\ngoverning physical laws to solve physical problems, like the flow of a fluid in a pipe, or the response of a crystal to an electric\nfield.\n4.11\nThe principle of minimum energy follows from the second law of thermodynamics. It states that for a closed system with\nconstant external parameters and entropy, the internal energy will decrease and approach a minimum value at equilibrium.\n4.12\nThe variable domain refers to a set of values that a variable can assume. For instance, when considering the bending\nstiffness of a tree trunk the variable domain contains all data related to possible and potential wind load conditions.\n4.10\n\nThe Element: the Discretization Technique as applied in FEM 117\n\nGiven the designer’s ability to manipulate the already modeled form in order to increase its fitness, the\nquestion arises as to whether or not such an approach can be generalized to include problems of formgeneration. In other words, if one is given a set of constraints, an objective function4.13 , and some\nmaterial parameters can form emerge?\n4.8.3\n\nHomogenization Methods and their Relevance to Form-Generation\n\nOptimal shape design of structural elements based on boundary variations results in final designs that\nare topologically equivalent to the initial choice of design. This can be considered a drawback regarding\nthe possibility of larger ranges of design solutions. Another limitation of shape optimization methods\nis that it typically introduces some meshing errors to the final element approximation of the analysis\nproblem (Bendsøe and Sigmund 2003). The homogenization method first introduced and developed by\nProf. Kikuchi from the University of Michigan, presents a methodology for optimal shape design where\nboth of these limitations can be avoided. The great advantage of this method lies in its relation to modern\nproduction techniques4.14 and consists of computing the optimal distribution in space of an anisotropic\nmaterial4.15 . This material is modeled by introducing an infimum4.16 of periodically distributed small\nholes in a given homogeneous, isotropic material, with the requirement that the resulting structure can\ncarry any given load combinations as well as satisfy other design requirements (Bendsøe and Sigmund\n2003). Current shape optimization techniques operate by generating boundary variations for any given\nform while the homogenization method promotes directional changes in the material’s microstructure\ngenerated by optimal topological variation corresponding to structural performance requirements.\n4.8.4\n\nComputational Issues in Homogenization Methods\n\nShape optimization of linearly elastic structures has been studied for over fifteen years and has reached a\nlevel of maturity that makes it possible to implement the methods in CAE (computer aided engineering)\nsystems for production use (Bendse and Sigmund 2003).\nOne of the major challenges that lie at the core of shape optimization is the difficulty in modifying the\ntopology of a structure during the design process. This challenge has resulted in thorough studies carried\nout in various settings that define the mathematical foundations for optimal shape design and design\nsensitivity analysis in boundary variation method.\nSince change of topology cannot be executed in the design process, the state of the art today for shape\ndesign is that shape optimization is possible under the assumption that the initial topology is fixed during the iterative design optimization. In order to tackle the problem of topological variation, one must\nconsider the possibility of representing a given shape without the use of shape functions (as is usually\nthe case with boundary variation and sensitivity methods). The homogenization method was introduced\nby Kikuchi in the late 80’s as such possible approach in shape optimization. It does so by transforming\nany given shape optimization problem to a material distribution problem using composite materials. The\nmethod considers two material constituents defined as substance and void. Instead of using the typical\n4.13\n\nThe function determining the objective of a given optimization process which is also considered the function to be maximized or minimized in optimization theory.\n4.14\nSuch production technique include numerically controlled milling and plastic forming with controlled porosity through\ncontrolled cooling\n4.15\nThe term anisotropy is used here to describe direction-dependent properties of materials. For a more detailed description,\nplease refer to the second chapter of this thesis.\n4.16\nIn mathematics, particularly set theory, the infimum (plural infima) of a subset of some set is the greatest element (not\nnecessarily in the subset) that is less than or equal to all elements of the subset.\n\n118 DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nboundary variation methods for shape optimization, the homogenization method is applied to determine\nmacroscopic constitutive equations4.17 for the material with microscopic material constituents.\nProblems of optimal structural design have been previously researched from a material perspective (Olhoff, Rønholt et al. 1998), and the computational approaches that have been developed in this context\nhave great relevance for design processes informed by material behavior. The problem of thickness distribution as a function of variable load conditions, for example, has been previously examined for elastic\nplates and other generic structural components . Thickness distribution may be regarded as a problem\nof shape optimization dealt with from the point of view of constraints described by the shape and its\ncontours. However, in introducing a material’s micro-structure in the formulation of optimal-design\nproblems, the work of Olhoff and Cheng has forged the way to a series of works exploring the role of\ntopology on optimization. In this case, topological order is defined by micro-structural manipulations\nthat give directionality to the shape or geometry at hand (Olhoff, Rønholt et al. 1998).\nProblems of optimization can therefore be classified as belonging to either sizing problems, or shape design problems. The plate design problem, focused on the plate’s contour as a function of the load applied\non the shape naturally falls under the rubric of sizing problems, even when material composition is considered. Such is the classic case where calculations are applied on a plate constructed from two dissimilar\nmaterials in a given volume fraction. Conversely, the design of a torsion bar where one must consider the\ninclusion of a weak material in a strong one is considered a shape design problem. Interestingly, both of\nthese typical cases suggest that laminated structures, made of two or more materials composed together,\nyield more efficient designs. This requires that the designer move from a shape-centric approach to a\nmaterial-centric approach where material composition may be included in problems of optimal shape design. In other words, micro-structures must be designed in order to obtain the strongest structures. This\neffort requires a consistent way of computing effective materials properties for materials with microstructures which is at the heart of the homogenization method (Bendsøe and Sigmund 2003). Optimal\ndesign of structures is therefore closely related to studies of micro-structures and the problem of finding\noptimal bounds on the effective material properties for composites. In mathematical terms the introduction of micro-structures in the formulation of structural design problems corresponds to a relaxation of\nthe variation problem that can be formulated for the design optimization (Bendsøe and Sigmund 2003).\nThe computational approach at the basis of the homogenization method considers any given structural\nelement4.18 to be a spatial object defined purely by the loads it is meant to carry, its volume, and its design\nrequirements including stress and strain limitations. A rough block is then assumed4.19 , the material of\nwhich is gradually removed according to the loading conditions based on finite-element approximations.\nThe following steps of this method include traditional boundary variation optimization based on the\ndesign as it was computed in the initial phase.\nThe following steps are used to characterize the homogenization problem:\n1. A reference domain is chosen, which allows the designer to define surface tractions4.20 and fixed\nboundaries.\n2. A composite material is chosen. This composite is constructed by periodic repetition of a unit cell\nconsisting of the chosen material with one or more holes. The effective material properties of the\n4.17\n\nConstitutive equations are typically used in physics to describe the relation between two physical quantities (or tensors)\nthat are particular to a given material or substance, and approximate the response its response to external forces. In structural\nanalysis, constitutive relations link between stresses or forces to strains or deformations. The stress-strain constitutive relation\nfor linear materials is commonly known as Hooke’s law.\n4.18\nThe method assumes linear elastic members only.\n4.19\nA “fixed domain”.\n4.20\nReferring to the adhesive friction between two surfaces in the case of a shape composed of two materials or more designed\nas a laminated structure.\n\nThe Element: the Discretization Technique as applied in FEM 119\n\ncomposite are computed using the homogenization theory (Bendse and Sigmund 2003) . This step\nprovides a functional relationship between the density of the composite (defined by the sizes of its\nholes) and its effective material properties.\n3. The optimal distribution of the composite material is computed in the reference domain. This step\nallows to treat the optimization problem as a sizing problem with the density as the sizing variable.\n4. The optimal distribution of material as defining a shape is interpreted, in the sense of the general\nshape design formulation.\nThe proposed homogenization method can thus provide the optimal shape as well as the topology of\na mechanical element. The method is a material distribution method, based on the use of an artificial\ncomposite material with microscopic voids.\n4.9\n4.9.1\n\nMaterial Representation in Digital Design\nBinary Materials\n\nQuestions regarding the emulation of natural processes via computational logic, tools and technologies are a real challenge to multiple fields in many different ways. Computer scientists, biologists,\nand chemists amongst others, are all attempting to unveil the mysteries of nature’s “computational”\nparadigms as they convert nature’s logic to binary code. Over the last decade, more than a few MIT theses have sprung out of a frustration with existing computational paradigms (and their related fabrication\ntechnologies) combined with a fascination with nature. Biomolecular self-assembly has been researched\nby giants in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence. In the Media Lab, such challenging\ndesign trajectories have been directed by Neil Gershenfeld of the Center for Bits and Atoms, and by\nJoseph Jacobson, director of the Molecular Machines group. The work of Saul Griffith, Growing Machines, is of relevance (Griffith 2004) as well as pioneering work by Manu Prakash - Microfluidic Bubble\nLogic - which offers new computing paradigms where bits can simultaneously transport and manipulate\nmaterials and information (Gershenfeld and Prakash 2008).\nWhat appears at the core of all works related to any association between the natural and the digital is the\nquest for units. Moreover: questions regarding the challenge to emulate biology constantly boil down to\nquestions regarding calibration. Each knowledge domain is concerned with its own set of units: protons,\natoms, molecules, nucleotides, chromosomes, cells, material grains are all different ways by which\nto examine any given natural objet. Yet while a biologist is primarily concerned with the specimen’s\ncellular functions, a material scientist is interested in scales that range between chemical composition\nand mechanical behavior. The computer scientist, on the other hand, is traditionally engaged with bits\nthe basic units of information which exist in two distinct states and are interpreted as the logical values\n“1” and “0”.\nIn digital imaging, the smallest unit available for visual manipulation is the pixel. The pixel is defined as\na picture element, a single point in a raster image4.21 . Represented by dots or squares, pixels are generally\narranged in a two-dimensional grid. Each pixel represents a sample of the original image, where more\nsamples typically provide more accurate representations of the original image. The intensity of each\npixel is variable as well as its color definition, typically combined of red, green and blue values.\n4.21\n\nIn computer graphics, a raster graphics image or bitmap is a data structure representing a generally rectangular grid of\npixels, or points of color, viewable via a monitor, paper, or other display medium. Raster images are stored in image files with\nvarying formats.\n\n120 DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nCurrent CAD applications do not support the descriptions of internal material composition. However,\nsome options exist which employ digital entities capable to describe micro-scale physical properties of\nmaterials and internal composition. Such entities include:\n4.9.1.1\n\nVoxels\n\nVoxels are digital volume elements analogous to 2D pixels whose position is defined by their proximity\nto other voxels in 3D space. Voxels are good at representing regularly-sampled spaces that are nonhomogeneously filled and are often used in the visualization and analysis of medical and scientific data.\nThe origin of the voxel has its roots in the medical industry. Voxels are frequently used in the visualization and analysis of medical data. These processes are generally associated with morphometrics the\nfield concerned with variation in the form of organisms.\n4.9.1.2\n\nMaxels\n\nThe basic unit for functional gradient materials (FGM) representation is the maxel4.22 . The attributes of\nmaxel include the location and volume fraction of individual material components. A maxel is also used\nin the context of the additive manufacturing processes (such as stereolithography, selective laser sintering, fused deposition modeling, etc.) to describe a physical voxel (a portmanteau of the words ‘material’\nand ‘voxel’), which defines the build resolution of either a rapid prototyping or rapid manufacturing\nprocess, or the resolution of a design produced by such fabrication means.\n4.9.1.3\n\nFinite-Elements (FEM/FEA)\n\nThe Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical technique for solving partial differential or integral\nequations over complex domains (such as cars, pipelines, complex building skins). The aim is to simulate physical behavior under structural and/or environmental loading cases. The method operates by\napplying a mesh discretization of a continuous domain into a set of discrete sub-domains, usually called\nelements. Elements are predominantly small triangular features comprising the surface area of the simulated domain and can be individually analyzed.\n4.9.1.4\n\nParticle System Elements\n\nA particle system is a computer graphics technique to simulate physical fuzzy phenomena that are almost impossible to reproduce using conventional rendering techniques (such as the simulation of some,\nmoving water, dust and hair). Particles are typically controlled by emitters, which acts as the particle’s\nsource and determines it location and motion in 3D space. The emitter has attached to it a set of particle\nbehavior parameters including spawning rates (determining how many particles are generated per time\nunit), its initial velocity vector (emittance direction upon creation), lifetime, color and more.\n4.9.1.5\n\nVague Discrete Modeling Elements (VDM)\n\nVague Discrete Modeling is a technique which supports the modeling of features, functions and methods\nof geometrical objects in associative modeling environments such that every feature is defined as a rule,\ncapable of modifying its representation. The technique is vague in the sense that multiple objects are\nrepresented by one interval model, and that multiple shape instances can be generated based on certain\n4.22\nThe term was introduced in 2005 by Rajeev Dwivedi and Radovan Kovacevic at Research Center for Advanced Manufacturing (RCAM).\n\nMaterial Representation in Digital Design 121\n\ninstantiation rules. This allows the definition of an object’s global shape while remaining the possibility\nto modify the shape in relation to constructive, functional, ergonomic or aesthetic constraints. The model\nis represented by 3D points representing its geometrical boundaries as sets of instances of object clusters.\nThe outcome is a nominal discrete shape that is defined in terms of its typology, but its geometry is\ntransformable depending on parameters defined by the user.\n4.9.1.6\n\nSummary\n\nThe common denominator for these four methods is the representation of physical behavior and/or material properties by assigning properties to discrete features comprising the model, whether by using\nvoxels, elements, particles or point-sets. One major disadvantage of all entities mentioned above is their\nconsumption of computational power in calculations. Also, the editing of such formats is made difficult\nby the lack of a robust method to relate between them in order to combine and integrate modeling and\nanalysis routines.\n4.9.2\n\nNon-Binary Material Representation\n\nComputational approaches supporting the representation of physical matter, whether through elements,\nparticles or voxels have the major advantage of describing 3-D forms with varied material properties,\nsuch that the rate of graduation is informed by the granularity of the representational technique. This\nintroduces one of the main questions repeatedly highlighted in this research regarding the smallest unit\nof matter. Such a “material unit” must be small enough to support material property graduation as a\nfunction of structural and environmental performance, and yet big enough to be physically constructed.\nBut what computational environment support such design processes?\nVarious recent developments operating at the intersection between natural sciences and computation have\nexplored alternative approaches to rapid fabrication processes supporting a graduated materials approach.\nIndeed, the question of generating form from scratch has not yet been resolved in these applications;\nhowever, they hold great relevance for its conceptualization.\nOne such project originated in the field of Computer Aided Tissue Engineering, or CATE (Sun, Starly et\nal. 2004). Computer Aided Tissue Engineering enables a systematic application of computer-aided technologies, i.e., computer aided design (CAD), image processing, computer-aided manufacturing (CAM),\nand solid freeform fabrication (SFF) for modeling, designing, simulating, and manufacturing of biological tissue and organ substitutes. Through the use of CATE, the design and fabrication of intricate three\ndimensional architecture of scaffold can be realized with reproducible accuracy to assist biologists in\nstudying complex tissue engineering problems (Sun, Starly et al. 2004). Most importantly, this approach\npoints towards the ability to analyze and fabricate natural specimens utilizing a voxel-based approach.\n4.10\n\nMaterial Fabrication in Digital Design\n\nCurrent rapid fabrication technologies are designed as software and hardware packages separate from\nmodeling and analytical environments. Since we are dealing with form-generation processes that may\ncarry the potential to integrate physical material properties within the design process, a quick review of\ncurrent state-of-the-art fabrication technologies seems appropriate.\n4.10.1\n\nDiscrete Parts, Disintegrated Processes: The Limitations of CAM\n\nA wide range of manufacturing technologies supporting rapid prototyping (RP) processes have recently\nmade their appearance in both academic institutions and industrial corporations. Such technologies\n\n122 DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\ncollectively serve the goal of fabricating parts and prototypes by laying down material in a gradual,\ncontrolled way, and in contrast to traditional manufacturing methods based on removing material (i.e.\nmilling, turning) or deforming material (i.e. casting, molding). They include layered manufacturing,\nadditive manufacturing and stereolithography. To date, software efforts in this area have focused on\nachieving compatibility between existing CAD tools and RP manufacturing processes. Geared toward the\ndesign of parts manufactured by traditional methods, current RP technologies do not facilitate designers\nwith the exploitation of the expanded design space offered by layered manufacturing (LM) technologies\n(Chandru, Manohar et al. 1995).\n4.10.2\n\nFrom Discrete to Gradual Rapid-Fabrication Methods\n\nA typical form-generation process in the design and architectural practice involves the geometrical representation of shapes and their fabrication first as models and then as full scale constructions4.23 . The\ncurrent range of rapid prototyping machines can be broadly classified based on the way they add material\nto an object under fabrication (Vijay and Edmond 1995):\n1. Sequential vector-based systems create layers by the sequential formation solidification or deposition of the contours in the object’s cross sections. Solid interiors are obtained with a hatching or\nfilling-in operation.\n2. Parallel image-based system use masks to create successive layers of the component. Either a light\nsource solidifies a photopolymer or a sprayer deposits a material on surfaces exposed by the mask.\nThe advantage of the former approach is that geometric complexity does not affect the time it takes to\ncomplete a layer. Each mask is simply a slice of the object essentially, the image of the object’s cross\nsection.\nFor computational environments that support the integration of physical parameters, whether through\nvoxels, particles or any other approach to the discretization of 3-D form, a similar approach to fabrication\nseems only suitable and reported to be well suited to parallel systems (Vijay and Edmond 1995).\n4.10.3\n4.10.3.1\n\nAdvantages of utilizing a Voxel-based Approach to Fabrication\nIntegrated Interface\n\nHowever, such systems require a new geometric modeling approach uniquely customized to support it.\nWhereas traditional geometry based modelers displays a smooth, shaded object that gives the designer\nno feedback on the actual surface finish of the object after fabrication, a voxel based modeling approach\nnaturally provides the designer with a WYSIWYG interface relating not only to the contours of the 3-D\nform but also to its substance representation.\n4.10.3.2\n\nSmooth Transition between File Types\n\nA voxel-based approach to fabrication carries the advantage of supporting a relatively smooth transition\nbetween file types. The component is modeled, and then analyzed using a finite-element analysis module.\nThe design is then iterated to account for the analysis results and the model is output in a given format\n(e.g. .STL) for fabrication. Digital fabrication equipment, such as layered manufacturing technologies\n4.23\n\nSince this thesis will mostly focus on digital fabrication technologies and their potential interface with modeling and analysis environments, we will consider the construction of physical matter as products of digital fabrication, and more specifically,\nlayered manufacturing technologies.\n\nMaterial Fabrication in Digital Design 123\n\nfor instance, then accepts the .STL file and generates a set of slices by orienting the object based on\nconstraints and process parameters unique to a given fabrication technology. Because of the discretization inherent to LM the resulting component could have properties different from what the CAD analysis\npredicted. A voxel-based approach, in contrast, eliminates the need for an intermediate format as well as\nfor a post processing step beyond the designer’s control (Vijay and Edmond 1995).\n4.10.3.3\n\nDirect Fabrication\n\nImage-based layered manufacturing (LM) systems do not require a slicing step with the voxel based\napproach, since the slices in three orthogonal directions are directly available from the voxel volume.\nHowever, vector based LM equipment requires a translation step to extract contours and enclosed regions\nfrom the image data of each slice. The obvious drawback is the size of the data, but image compression\ntechniques can mitigate this problem.\n4.10.3.4\n\nVoxel-Maxel Relationships\n\nIn a voxel-based approach there exist a direct relationship between a voxel and the basic additive resolution of the LM equipment. The relationship implies that the surface area of the resulting object can be\nestimated by identifying the exposed voxels in the model, adding the area contributed by the voxel faces\non the boundary, and using suitable filters to simulate the effects of merging and coagulation behaviors\nin the real material. Properties such as friction coefficients, surface roughness, and contact area between\ninteracting parts to be estimated (Vijay and Edmond 1995).\n4.10.3.5\n\nPrinting Composites\n\nA voxel-based approach carries the potential to exploit a major capability of layered manufacturing (LM)\nequipment by considering the stacking of material layers with varied discrete properties. From here it\nis relatively easy to imagine the potential of this approach in the design and fabrication of composite\nmaterials. The range of materials that current commercial LM systems handle is limited but growing\n(Vijay and Edmond 1995).\n4.10.4\n\nSummary\n\nThe voxel-based approach for geometric modeling offers a powerful methodology for the new rapid\nprototyping technologies. It has several advantages over conventional modeling methods, stemming\nchiefly from the close resemblance between a voxel model of an object and the object fabricated using\nan LM technology.\n4.11\n\nTowards Material-based Design Computation\n\nBefore the integration of computer-aided design (CAD) in architecture, the architect would initiate a\ndesign process by generating some geometric form which would later be assigned a set of materials\nalong with some structural and environmental analysis. This process entails that we begin with form.\nCAD was typically developed to support processes of design automation, but interestingly, it did not\nchallenge the design process itself; it only made it easier, and better still faster.\nWe have previously seen that Nature and the world of natural materials operate quite differently, as form\nis merely a byproduct of assigning material parameters to environmental processes. In the previous two\nchapters we have characterized natural forms and materials by their ability to negotiate between multiple\n\n124 DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nperformance-criteria in order to generate objects that are highly customized to fit their environment. In\naddition, they are characterized by the lack of separation between processes of form-generation, evaluation and fabrication.\nGiven the obvious values rooted in Nature’s processes and products (i.e. material efficiency and high\nlevels of customization), it is imperative that the world of design considers alternative computational\napproaches to design that promote and sustain such values.\nAs we move away from the world of computational geometry and into applications from structural and\nmaterial engineering, we find that in these disciplines form is closely related to physical properties,\nbehaviors and anticipated functions. Amongst the various applications supporting physical simulation of\nsorts (i.e. finite element methods) we also find novel expressions for combining such applications with\nnovel form-generation processes (i.e. cellular automata and genetic algorithms combined with some\nfinite-element method). The problem with such experimental design methods still remains the disparity\nbetween the actual form generated by the script or the program, and its material properties and behavior\nrelative to their anticipated functions. As we aim to unite between generation, evaluation and eventually\nfabrication, we must look beyond current approaches in design computation that support and promote\nseamless integration between the digital and the physical domains.\nIn the following chapter a methodological framework entitled Material-based Design Computation will\nbe introduced. It was developed to support a new universal approach to the problem of digital formgeneration with continuously varying material properties satisfying prescribed material conditions on a\nfinite collection of material features and global constraints.\n\nFigures 125\n\nFigure 4.1: Parametric design exercise exploring the relationship between a\nsingular parametric component and its “hosting” environment.

By its very nature, design is simply not sustainable, and the built environment is\nstruggling to reduce its carbon impact upon Nature’s weathering. To date, and without a doubt, the most\nurging problem in the design of the built (and consumed) environment is its massive contribution to the\nearth’s carbon footprint.\n5.1.1\n\nTowards Sustainable Products: Multifunctionality and Mass-Customization\n\nThe theoretical basis of this thesis is that at the root of the crisis, lays the problem of functional disintegration, i.e. the notion that each design constraint whether social, spatial, structural or environmental must be satisfied by a set of parameters discretely assigned to it. Such design requirements are typically\npartitioned in terms of both material (“product”) and methodological content (“process”).\nTake, for instance, the design of a building façade. Not unlike the human skin or a plant’s tissue, a\nbuilding’s façade acts both as a barrier and as a filter controlling the load and movement of air from\nthe exterior environment into the interior spaces and vice versa. In the artificial world however, barrier\nand filter-associated requirements are generally treated discretely as opposed to being composed as an\nintegrated tissue. More specifically, the skeletal, load-bearing elements of the façade (designed to provide\nstability against wind loads) and the environmental elements of the façade (designed to control thermal\nflow) are assigned separate materials requiring separate processes of design, fabrication, construction\n\nNature’s Way, Material’s Strategy, Computation’s New Paradigm and the Formula for Natural Design 133\n\nand assembly. Steel and glass are typical materials applied for structural and environmental control\nrespectively.\nThe discrete assignment of materials (e.g. steel and glass) per their discrete respective functions (e.g.\nstructural soundness and environmental/visual comfort) is characteristic of turn of the 20th century architecture, along with the introduction of steel and glass to the design of large scale buildings and skyscrapers. Here, once again, it is the use of innovative materials and their integration within the construction\nindustry that defined the architectural movements that followed (e.g. International Style Architecture,\nand so forth).\nPost-and-beam construction is not in the least sustainable insofar as it aims to combine functions by way\nof separation rather than integration. In addition to transferring the self-weight of the structure to the\nground, the structural components of the building also serve to transfer wind forces as well as to provide\nsupport for the cladding and various other functions. The conceptual and operative partitioning between\nstructural and environmental building elements has contributed to various cladding types that followed\nsuch as the curtain wall façade and the double skin facade. The curtain wall façade generally is supported\nby the edge of the building structure such that it is exterior to the skeletal system of the building. In turn,\nthe double skin façade promotes the consolidation of the building’s ventilation within the boundaries\nof two layers of cladding. Thermal insulation is provided between those two skins that meets specific\nenergy demands and user comfort requirements (such as visual, hygienic, tactile, olfactory and acoustic\nrequirements), while the load bearing elements are interior to the skin.\nClearly, there are numerous good reasons for the design world to embrace and promote such strategies\nof functional discreteness in building design and construction; modularity and the ease by which to\nfabricate and replace building components being one of them. Indeed it may be argued that such age-old\nconstruction methods are here to stay precisely for their efficiencies. On the other hand, and considering\nthe state and rate of deterioration of environmental conditions, it is perhaps time to broadly consider\nalternative approaches to both design and construction, as radical as this proposal may appear.\n5.1.2\n\nTowards Sustainable Processes: Integrated Modeling, Analysis and Fabrication Environments\n\nThe case of cladding is indicative not only of functional discreteness, but it also illustrates the related\nnotion of methodological discreteness. That is to say, that the cause (or the effect, both may be equally\napplied in this case) for functional separation supported by its material counterparts is the outcome of\nthe disintegration between the various processes of design. Not only do we use particular processes to\ndesign, fabricate and assemble a specific material, but, more importantly, such disintegration appears to\nbe paramount and inherent in the design process itself: modeling, simulation, analysis and fabrication are\nall compartmentalized by method and by disciplines, as architects, engineers, scientists and construction\nexperts exercise their own domain knowledge using their own methodological routines. As designers\nwe may ask ourselves: When was the last time you used a CFD5.1 application in the design of a chair?\nWhen have you recently programmed a robotic arm to cut, assemble and construct an arch assembled\nfrom bricks? Have you ever used tensor math for the generation of hydrodynamic shapes?\nClearly, much waste is involved in translating a design idea to its physical manifestation, from the drawing board, or the screen, all the way to the building site. Not unlike the products and the buildings that\nwe design, our processes, too, are barely sustainable. Material waste is only one of the byproducts of\ncutting, milling or molding structural components into their desired shapes and forms. But when considering the design process itself, prior to its physical manifestation in built form, it is clear that processes\n5.1\nCFD stands for Computational Fluid Dynamics. It is considered one of the branches of fluid mechanics that uses numerical\nmethods and algorithms to solve and analyze problems that involve fluid flows.\n\n134 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nof simulation and analysis executed with state-of-the-art computational software are by their very nature\ninvolved with processes of optimization. Regardless of its waste factor, manipulated or not as it is being\noptimized according to a set of “fitness criteria”, the form of a product or a building is merely a formal\nstatement communicated in the language of geometry. Differences “in degree” - rather than differences\n“in kind” are generally all that is afforded by the engineering disciplines prior to fabrication. Indeed,\nstructural optimization as I view it is simply a figure of formal diet.\nProcesses of analysis are indeed not the only routines secondary to formal generation (could there be any\nother option?). The assignment of material properties to a presubscribed form are generally considered\nas subsequent to geometrical manifestations. As a result, one may often find cases, especially in recent\nyears, in which the relation between the geometrical form and the material chosen for its construction is\ncompletely counter logical insofar as a sustainable design process is desired.\nWith regards to the incorporation of state-of-the-art design computation and digital fabrication technologies as part of the design process, in recent years we have been witnessing the emergence of two\nfundamentally different approaches to design. On the one hand there exists a desire to explore an expressive formal repertoire (how curvy can a building become?) while on the other, an aspiration to redefine\nsustainable design as we know it. Those two approaches are effortlessly detected across the scope of\ncontemporary practice as two opposing worlds, each corresponding to a completely different set of values: formal expression vs. being good to our environment. The former approach celebrates advances in\ncomputation and digital fabrication technologies while the latter rejoices in the continuous improvement\nof building codes as they may become more environmentally friendly. For the green tribe, sustainable design is merely concerned with the evaluation of current building code and practice as it seeks to improve\nand advance its dissemination amongst designers and architects alike. In this light, any technological advancement devoted to challenges driven by formal content and its transformation into the physical realm\nis only harming our green regime. When our environment is what we wish to protect, such a disposition\nholds undeniable legitimacy. Indeed, most of the design processes linked to the generation, analysis and\nconstruction of formal challenges are anything but sustainable.\n5.1.3\n\nChapter Organization\n\nGiven that both our products and our processes appear to be harming our already injured planet, and\ngiven the will to embrace technological advancement, design, it seems, must seek an alternative model\nfor the generation of form. I, for one, turned to Nature in search of a revelation.\nThe following chapter introduces the assumptions, goals, objectives, issues and questions positioned\nat the heart of this research thesis. It culminates with a speculation about what the methodological\nframeworks supporting performative design experimentation might be.\nBased on the background research presented in the previous chapters, I present three major assumptions:\nthat natural objects are sustainable mainly due to the way in which materials are positioned and distributed to account for structural and environmental pressures such that each object is highly customized\nand fit for its environment; that form-generation processes in nature are more sustainable as they integrate\nbetween processes of modeling (growth), analysis (adaptation), and fabrication (material formation and\nresponse); and, that in nature the distinction between “material” and “structure” is elusive and irrelevant\nas they are so well-integrated and formally inter dependent.\nThe research goals focus on achieving a more sustainable design approach which manifests itself in the\ndesign of artificial products and processes favoring high levels of customization over mass production;\nintegrating between modeling, analysis and fabrication environments; utilizing a graduated property approach to the design of objects; and favoring material considerations over geometrical expression.\nIn line with the research goals, research objectives aim at: achieving high levels of customization through\n\nNature’s Way, Material’s Strategy, Computation’s New Paradigm and the Formula for Natural Design 135\n\nthe integration between multiple desirable functions; achieving an integrated design environment through\nthe integration of form-generation functions and analytical functions; implementing a graduated properties approach in design by developing form-generation environments based on material substance rather\nthan merely on contours of 3-D shape; and, finally, prioritizing matter over shape by developing a design process that takes into consideration substance properties prior to the generation of shape using a\nmaterial pixels approach presented in the following chapter.\nResearch issues range from models that allow incorporating multiple performance criteria, to ways in\nwhich to design highly integrated modeling and fabrication interfaces, as well as questions regarding the\nrole of variation and heterogeneity in design and ways in which the prioritization of matter over shape\ncan express itself in form-generation (Figure 5.1).\nResearch questions respectively spring from the issues presented and focus on non-binary computation;\nuniversal material units; relationships between material and structure; and the prospect of implementation\nof the concept of digital materials. The research questions presented above form the basis for the program\nof experimental research.\nThe chapter ends with a brief review of the methodologies studied and applied to explore the issues and\nquestions raised.\n5.2\n\nResearch Assumptions: Nature’s Products and Processes are Sustainable due to Product and\nProcess Integration\n\nNature is demonstrably sustainable. Her challenges have been resolved over eons to enduring solutions\nwith maximal performance using minimal resources. Unsurprisingly, Nature’s inventions have for all\ntime prompted human achievements and have led to the creation of exceedingly effective materials and\nstructures, as well as methods, tools, mechanisms and systems by which to design them.\n5.2.1\n\nNature’s Sustainable Products: Structured Difference\n\nNatural structures posses the highest level of seamless integration and precision with which they serve\ntheir functions. As previously reviewed in Chapter 2, a key distinguishing trait of nature’s designs is\nits capability in the biological world to generate complex structures of organic or inorganic multifunctional composites such as shells, pearls, corals, bones, teeth, wood, silk, horn, collagen, and muscle\nfibers (Benyus 2002). Combined with extracellular matrices, these structural biomaterials form microstructures engineered to adapt to prearranged external constraints introduced upon them during growth\nand/or throughout their life span (Vincent 1982). Such constraints generally include combinations of\nstructural, environmental and corporeal performance. Since all biological materials are made of fibers,\ntheir multifunctionality often occurs at nano through macro scales and is typically achieved by mapping\nperformance requirements to strategies of material structuring and allocation. The shape of matter is\ntherefore directly linked to the influences of force acting upon it (Vogel 2003). Material is concentrated\nin regions of high strength and dispersed in areas where stiffness is not required. It is a well known fact\nthat in nature shape is cheaper than material, yet material is cheap because it is effectively shaped and\nefficiently structured.\nMost importantly, Nature’s designs are structured such that they are able to adapt and respond to multiple\nfunctions and multiple performance criteria. The form of a tree branch for instance serves its structural\nrequirements, to self-sustain itself under heavy wind loads while at the same time it is designed to allow\nfor the transfer of fluid and heat through its internal and external tissues. In other words, natural tissues\nare sustainable by way of functional integration whereby one material modulates its internal structure in\norder to correspond to both structural and environmental stimuli.\n\n136 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nMultiple-performance negotiation is defined as the capacity to locally vary an object’s material properties such that it accurately corresponds to various structural and environmental constraints applied on it\nas part of the design process. The research assumption is that if products and buildings are designed as\nsystems that integrate multiple properties by continuously varying and controlling their internal properties, mechanical effectiveness is enhanced as well as environmental response, and the resulting designed\nproduct will, overall, become more sustainable. This assumption requires a new approach for the generation and materialization of form that is not motivated purely by form itself, but rather stimulated and\ndefined by environmental constraints. It is important to note, that such an approach also allows for the\ncustomization of any given design product or building to fit its particular fitness requirements.\nNumerous examples that support this approach in terms of the contribution to sustainable design have\nbeen provided in Chapter 3 from the field of product and industrial design. However, as previously\nidentified in Chapters 1 and 3, the main problem with current design approaches embracing multipleperformance negotiation (at least theoretically) is that the assignment of material properties in these cases\nis consistently secondary to their shapes and formal descriptions. I anticipate that the design approach\noffered by this thesis will extend itself to include the very initial stages of form-generation processes.\n5.2.2\n\nNature’s Sustainable Processes: Computing Difference\n\nNature’s capacity to generate multi-functional objects is fueled by its sustainable processes. In Nature,\nprocesses of modeling, analysis and fabrication are grouped to arrive at an integrated process such that\nthere are literally no differences between such phases. Human bone, as previously discussed in Chapter\n2, can remodel itself to fit the type of load it supports. We lose bone tissue in outer space where there is no\ngravity and we, women, gain bone tissue upon pregnancy to support additional body weight. It is called\nWolff’s Law, based on the pioneering discoveries of 19th century surgeon, Julias Wolff. Trabeculae\n(Latin, for “little beams”) are the structures in human bone. When bones are stimulated by additional\nweight, they lay down more calcium structures, more little beams. The bones become denser, harder, and\nmore durable. It would then be natural to assume that Nature engages in processes of modeling while it\nanalyzes, and while it fabricates. Such processes are unified into one integral chain of events whereby\nthe choice of material is directly linked to its functions. Form, as far as Nature is concerned, is beside\nthe point.\nThe initial design assumption that multi-performance negotiated products are more sustainable, and that\nprocesses which support it must be developed and applied across the board of design also assumes that\nthere exist processes of design generation to support it. Clearly, this is not the case (otherwise we would\nbe growing houses by now, rather than building them!)\nIf we assume that Nature’s Way is, by definition, sustainable, and if we have proven (as previously\ndemonstrated in Chapter 2 of this thesis) that in Nature there exists no separation between processes\nmodeling, analysis and fabrication, then such disintegration must be eliminated and, in turn, replaced by\na new approach to design supporting procedural integration.\n5.2.3\n\nHeterogeneity and Difference in Nature: Material as Structure and Structure as Material\n\nThe study of the classes of shape of organic forms, which may be identified with Goethe’s invention of\nMorphology, is but a fraction of that wider science of form which deals with the forms assumed by matter\nunder all its governing environmental conditions that are theoretically, and mathematically, conceivable.\nSuch sciences, of the forms of living and non-living natural organisms, are characterized by recurring\nbiological themes, and their variations. In Chapter 2, we have reviewed a range of natural objects and\nprocesses driven and expressed by material variation. Various examples have been provided that assist\n\nResearch Assumptions: Nature’s Products and Processes are Sustainable due to Product and Process Integration 137\n\nin classifying physical heterogeneity and variation as static (e.g. the fiber distribution in a tree trunk,\nor a branch), quasi-dynamic (e.g. the continuous arrangement of bone tissues as a function of the loads\napplied) and dynamic (e.g. mutable visco-elasticity in underwater creatures for dynamic mechanical response to control movement) are all compound expressions of the interaction between matter and energy,\ndriven by the mechanisms of growth, fitness and survival. Every physical phenomenon occurring in Nature is in fact composite, and every observable action and effect is a summation of countless subordinate\nactions (Thompson 1952). Living, as well as non-living organisms, represent, or occupy, force fields of\nimmense complexity. The simplest cases are met with a minimum departure from symmetry as could\nonly subsist under conditions of ideal and general simplicity. However simple Nature’s themes may appear to be (rules describing growth, or the distribution of material under load), its physical expressions\nare far from it. So, Nature, it appears, is defined by heterogeneity.\nIn Nature, variation and heterogeneity are achieved and assisted in processes that are both internal to\nthe organism itself (i.e. processes associated with growth), and external to it (i.e. processes associated\nwith the interaction between matter and environment). The latter is the subject of our research here, and\ndespite the difficulty that has previously been expressed regarding the need to understand Nature from a\nmaterials science and engineering perspective, I have chosen still to attempt to do so.\nImperative to the reading of this thesis is the understanding that variation is inherent to both Nature’s\n“products” and processes. It is achieved by Nature’s ability to heterogeneously structure materials, an\nability previously referred to as anisotropic structuring. Most biological systems are dominated by fibrous composite structures providing Nature with the means by which to inform structural and material\ndirectionalities.\nThis quality allows natural systems to:\n1. Create functional architectures and shapes\n2. Introduce and exploit heterogeneity and anisotropy locally (e.g. at the tissue level) and globally\n(e.g. at the organ level)\n3. Modulate physical properties of materials and structures\nThese mechanisms are applied to deal with:\n1. Functional demands\n2. External structural and material demands triggered by physical response to environmental conditions\n3. Internal structural and material demands triggered by processes of growth\nThe distinction between “material” and “structure” in Nature is not an obvious one. Take wood for\ninstance; clearly wood can be shaped and formed to fit almost any shape, while at the same time its\nmechanical performance varies when loaded in different directions. The structural properties of wood\nfor instance, not unlike most biological materials, widely vary when measured with the growth grain or\nagainst it such that its hardness and strength may differ for a given sample when measured in different\norientations. This property is called anisotropy and it is due to anisotropic structuring that nature can\ncreate sustainable structures efficiently (Vincent 1982).\nIn Chapter 2, we have defined and reviewed the property of certain materials to be directionally dependent. Such cases are typical of materials that have embedded in them a particular structure defining their\nphysical behavior. In essence, those materials are structures in their own right, their dominating features\nbeing dependent on their functional scale. In Nature, unlike the design disciplines, material and structure\n\n138 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nare strictly consolidated towards their desired function. Thus, a wood sample would be structured quite\ndifferently depending on its location in the overall structure of the tree. Such consolidation is consistent\nwith Nature’s Way: in Nature, a higher level structure (trunks and branches) is typically composed of\nmultiple copies of lower level structures (wood samples). Also, for every “Natural typology” there is an\nexplicit material organization associated with it (calcium structures for bone, wood structures for trees,\nand so on).\nFinally, biological materials do not distinguish between materials and structures (Rogers 1993). Costeffective and durable structures are the result of constraint negotiations carried on over millennia. For\nNature, the distinction between intelligent material systems and intelligent structures is irrelevant. Hence,\nsuch a distinction may only be applied superficially in terms of the scale of a material’s micro-structure\nwhich governs it behavior, regardless of its size (Rogers 1993).\n5.2.4\n\nSummary\n\nThe general assumptions central to this research are guided by the motivation to apply Nature’s strategies\nin the design of forms to real world products and processes. The impetus at the heart of such assumptions\nis fueled by the desire to define a new approach to Sustainable Design as we know it. The initial research\nassumption is articulated on the product level, from which follows the secondary assumption, articulated\nand geared towards the process level.\nIn contrast to contemporary practice routines that prioritize the role of geometry relative to materials\nand their desired performance, this research assumes that an alternative approach to design guided and\ndefined by the use and manipulation of physical matter may yield more sustainable design solutions that\ndo not compromise efficiency. The approach put forth is entitled Material-based Design and is believed\nto promote the two main ideas governing Nature’s Way. Those two ideas are here articulated as the two\nmain research assumptions on the basis of which a new design research field entitled Material-based\nDesign Computation is proposed and developed.\n5.3\n\nResearch Goals: Towards Natural Design as a Sustainable Design Approach\n\nCompared to Nature, our own material strategies appear to be much less sustainable and mostly wasteful.\nSince the industrialized age, the construction industry has been dependent on discrete solutions for distinct functions (Oxman 2008). As previously suggested, building skins are an example of such a claim.\nSteel and glass possess significantly different structural and environmental properties which relate to significantly different performance requirements. Diversity is achieved by sizing, rather than by substance\nvariation, and it is typically mass produced, not customized. As far as material structuring is considered,\nin the artificial world, especially in the construction industry, one property fits all. Can nature’s ability\nbe emulated in the design of the artificial?\nWith the assistance of advances in structural and material engineering entering contemporary discourse,\narchitectural culture appears poised for transformation. This aim of this research is to advance Nature’s\nstrategies in structuring matter by designing synthetic multifunctional materials competing with evolution’s unrestricted time-frame of design process. Fitness, not form, is what actually matters. Welcome\nthe new materiality!\nThe thesis is motivated by the desire to invent, test and implement a new design approach inspired by\nNature with the aim of enhancing Sustainable Design products and processes. Similarly, it is devoted to\ncorrespond to the two assumptions raised in this chapter, respectively relating to the design of products\nand the design of processes. It does so by corresponding to problems raised by contemporary discourse\nand by questioning the role of computational media in the design process and examining new ways in\n\nResearch Goals: Towards Natural Design as a Sustainable Design Approach 139\n\nwhich such tools, techniques, and technologies could be revisited to redefine processes and products of\ndesign generation. Consequently the research questions posed in this section are geared towards design\nproducts and processes informed by computational routines and advanced digital technologies. Relevant\nliterature sources related to this knowledge domain have been reviewed in Chapter 4 of this thesis.\nThe two main research questions raised in this thesis are inextricably linked as interrelated aspects of\nthe same problem. We ask: in order to design in a novel, more sustainable way, a way more tuned\nto Nature’s designs, and assuming that designers are now facilitated with all the computational media\nrequired to potentially achieve such a mission, what information can computational units contain (e.g.\ngenetic, property, etc) and how small must such units become in order to contain such information (e.g.\npixel as atom, molecule, material substance)?\n5.3.1\n\nEnvironmental Customization\n\nGoal 1: To develop a sustainable design approach to the design of products and buildings that prioritizes\nmass customization over mass production\nThe fluttering of leaves in the strong winds affords us yet again with an example of Nature’s awe-inspiring\nabilities for tuning its material properties in just the right amount as she corresponds with conflicting conditions. Designing photosynthetic structures of sufficient rigidity is not a trivial task. Photovoltaic cells\n(PVC’s) embedded within structural cladding systems must confront parallel impediments through the\nstrategic assignment of properties. The surface area of a PV cell, much like other various sophisticated\nglazing systems, must be designed as both very thin and very rigid. In Chapter 2 we have classified such\nproblems as cases in performance negotiation. Such cases are characterized by Nature’s necessity to\nnegotiate between seemingly conflicting requirements. Such is the human bone’s ability to provide for\na highly robust structure while at the same time, to allow for relatively adaptable and dynamic response\nto changing load forces; or the leaf’s ability to provide for structural soundness amid the swaying of\nbranches during times of strong winds while simultaneously satisfying its function to trap solar energy\nphoto-synthetically a function that clearly demands the exposure of maximal surface area skyward. Both\nthe geometrical form of the leaf and its material substance promote significant features here: under strong\nwind loads, some leaves curl into cones, a response which significantly reduces drag.\nAll in all, the limits to Nature’s mechanical versatility seem immeasurable compared with our own practices. In Nature, a singular material may be programmed to be both stiff and soft (think for example of\nmuscle tissue!). Practical tradeoffs which satisfy and determine what deficiencies must be suffered in\none property in order to achieve high values in another are mostly treated by the intrinsic adaptability of\ndynamic material distribution. And indeed, within the biological world, the properties of a given material change from species to species, from habitat to habitat, and from location to location within a single\norganism. Similarities of fine tuning material properties appear consistently among very distantly related\norganisms which are subjected to similar environmental pressures.\nIn emulating Nature’s clandestine methods, Design must lend itself to new ways of considering the negotiation between, and the integration of, seemingly conflicting functions (Figure 5.2). With relatively few\nmaterials, Biology produces endless compounds where physical properties are fine-tuned to meet local\nneeds. In design, the tendency to treat every problem discretely often results in the production of waste\n(material, energy, computation, manpower and so forth). The alternative to design more “naturally” is\nnot a trivial one, namely as it requires that we rethink entirely the established traditions of the design\nprofessions; but this, I believe, holds much promise for the future of Sustainable Design. It goes without saying that embracing multi-performance negotiation requires that we also rethink and redefine the\ndesign process as a whole.\n\n140 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\n5.3.2\n\nForm-Generation Process Integration\n\nGoal 2: To develop a sustainable design process integrating design (form-generation) and engineering\n(form-evaluation and optimization) processes\nSustainable design products cannot possibly emerge without putting into practice approaches promoting\nsustainable design processes. In ancient times, so-called vernacular architecture was characterized by the\nnotion that local materials and structures define the form of habitat. As a result, in old-ages and ancient\ntimes, material, geometry and structure were united in the design of local products and environments.\nWaste of materials and processes was reduced to a minimum as locally available resources and traditions\nwere applied to address local needs. But, more importantly, at times where digital media were absent\nfrom processes of design, there seemed to be a fuller, more pronounced integration between processes\nof design modeling, simulation, analysis and fabrication; Or rather, all such routines were compounded\nto form an integrated process. Furthermore, processes we currently consider as the final stages of the\ndesign process (fabrication, construction and assembly being some of them) were, during ancient times,\nthe very processes that initiated any design and indeed, defined its very form.\nThe segregation between processes of design synthesis often driven by the designer or the architect,\nand processes of design analysis often driven by the structural or environmental engineer, is typical of\ncontemporary practice. There exists a clear hierarchy in the timing at which each of these routines is\napplied (else, how can you otherwise analyze that which has not been created?), but also in the discipline\nor domain knowledge associated with each: the structural engineer will run analytical programs to evaluate the structural soundness of a building component only after it has been designed by the architect.\nFollowing, the environmental engineer will run his own analytical routines to confirm its desired performance under wind loads and extreme thermal conditions. Finally, the design is handed to the fabricator\nand rationalized according to the type and method by which to construct and assemble the component.\nIn addition, there typically exists some loss of geometrical information in translating design-to-analysisto-fabrication routines. The conventional design sequence does not necessarily consider in advance\nwhich fabrication technology is applied to the production of the part. Consequently, the part is designed,\nanalyzed and fabricated using forms of geometrical rationalization that significantly differ in nature and\nmuch information is lost during translation; more about that later.\nIt comes as no surprise then that the current cycle of design and analysis is anything, but sustainable.\nClearly, it is streamlined to fit the logical progress of formal generation from conception to construction;\nhowever, the avocation of process integration in lieu of the traditional discrete, streamlined, tradition\nmay lead the way to novel, more sustainable ways of originating form.\nNature, it appears yet again, has it all figured out. As previously demonstrated in Chapter 2 of this thesis,\nin Nature there exists no separation between processes of design generation (“synthesis”) and processes\nof design evaluation (“analysis”). The human bone re-accommodates its formal organization (“geometry”), through material distribution (material) according to the magnitude and direction of loads applied\nto it at any given moment (structure). Considering current technological advancement in materials science and engineering, as well as in digital fabrication, it may well be the right time to promote procedural\nintegration.\n5.3.3\n\nThe Non-Assembly\n\nGoal 3: To develop sustainable design products without assemblies and joints that support smooth transitions between properties\nGiven that biological materials and structures present nano-, and meso-mechanical heterogeneity that is\nexpected to influence and contribute to their superior performance, we seek to devise a strategy of struc-\n\nResearch Goals: Towards Natural Design as a Sustainable Design Approach 141\n\ntural heterogeneity in macro-scale whereby the distribution of macro-mechanical properties is informed\nby functional constraints. This approach will ultimately result in continuous tissue-like structures, which,\nunlike the classical assembly approach, promote the distribution of properties and behavior. The assumption is that such forms and structures are more sustainable than conventionally contracted ones due to\nmaterial efficiency. We aim at predicting that non-uniform material organization over large areas and\nincreased mechanical performance arising from macro-scale heterogeneity lead to significantly different\nbiomechanical properties compared with a uniform material. Such a fundamental concept applicable to a\nbroad class of biological materials, as has been demonstrated throughout chapter 3 of this thesis, serves as\na source of inspiration when considering such property enhancements in macro-scale and across multiple\nmedia of construction technologies. Speculations regarding the role of heterogeneity in strain concentration (as well as other positive factors) thus point towards its advantages to the mechanical functions of\ndesign environments.\nThis approach, motivated by the desire to consider an alternative approach to form-, and space-making,\nstands in shear contrast to conventional design methods and compositional construction techniques where\nparts are manufactured and added together to create an assembly. In contrast to such classical macroscopic architectural designs, we aim at generating design methods supporting highly customized products and environments, more efficient and effective in satisfying their objectives not unlike the way nature\nhas it. Nature ubiquitously utilizes architectural principles at multiple length scales to create efficient,\nlightweight, high strength load-bearing structures out of relatively weak materials (e.g. 3 , proteins, cartilage etc.) Biological materials and structures are thus a source of inspiration, as a starting point for\nexploring such new design spaces.\n5.3.4\n\nMatter over Shape\n\nGoal 4: To develop a sustainable design process that prioritizes material over shape (in contradiction to\nthe traditional design approach where matter is patched onto form).\nConventional design processes rely on the generation of 3-D geometrical form typically using architectural CAD software. The assignment of a design material from which to fabricate the product (or\nconstruct the building part), typically follows from the designer’s commitment to form. Utilizing stateof-the-art computational modeling environments allows the designer to either generate form by running\nsome form-generation script that typically bears no relation to its physical manifestation, or by subdividing the geometry into constructible components. In both cases, processes of cell generation (and growth)\nor tessellation (subdivisions) are devised as a means of simplifying the design problem while considering\nits fabrication and assembly strategies.\nWe propose that in order to achieve more sustainable design products, processes of form-generation must\ninclude tools supporting the integration of analysis software allowing for the parallel iteration between\ndigital form and physical evaluation of its relevant performance. Ultimately, we aim at designing computational environments which may potentially support physical attributes relevant to the architect, such\nas stiffness and translucency which may contribute to the generation of form itself. Several strategies for\nachieving this goal will be further developed and presented in the following chapter.\n5.4\n5.4.1\n\nResearch Objectives: Nature’s Strategies Recomputed\nStiff and Transparent, Soft and Opaque\n\nObjective 1: To develop a design process that incorporates multiple structural and environmental performance criteria in the design process\n\n142 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nAn objective function (or the target function) is generally associated with an optimization problem which\ndetermines how good a solution is (Atallah, Fox et al. 1999). Structural and environmental optimization,\nexecuted through the Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) respectively, allows for the evaluation and local modulation of volume and surface features of an object under\na given set of constraints (i.e. loads).\n5.4.2\n\nSite to FAB\n\nObjective 2: To develop a design process integrating modeling, analysis, simulation and fabrication in\none process.\nIntegrated design processes save time and computation, and allow considering the design space as one\nunified environment where modeling, analysis and fabrication can be interrelated. Currently, however,\nsuch design platforms are discrete and separated by methods and by tools: the designer typically models\na given shape, then sends out this shape to evaluation software for physical simulation and finally, it is\nassigned a material and a fabrication strategy for its construction. Such protocol discreteness must be\nremoved, if one considers the potential interrelation between geometry, material and structure as part and\nparcel of the integration between modeling, analysis and fabrication routines. In the scope of this work\nwe seek to invent new ways of working that support those integrations and promote a more sustainable\nway of making design.\n5.4.3\n\nNo-Stop-Tissue\n\nObjective 3: To develop a design process that incorporates, computes and generates variable properties\nin product and building design\nThis question triggers a set of inquiries into the definition of “material” in design. Beyond its classical\ndefinition as a particular substance, one can classify a set of definitions under the rubric of material\nbehavior. The proposal seeks to operate on the latter and claim to control and parametrically modify\nproperties such as elasticity, stiffness, transparency, thermal conductivity etc.\nThe objective of answering this question lies in the systematic classification of material properties and\nhow they may relate to geometrical manipulation. Here we begin to chart out micro and macro-structural\nproperties along with rigorous descriptions of formal attributes which are potentially parametrically defined.\nThe proposal also seeks to demonstrate material differentiation, defined here as the ability to locally\nvary material properties corresponding to a given set of conditions and governed by a specific objective\nfunction, by selecting a few materials and assigning structural and/or environmental constraints to them.\nThe main goal is to arrive at an algorithm which varies the geometrical and physical properties of a given\nmaterial according to environmental parametric data informed by the user.\n5.4.4\n\nPhysical Geometry\n\nObjective 4: To develop a design approach that integrates material properties as part of the design\nprocess\nDigital representation of physical behavior has been addressed in the fields of computer science, material engineering and mathematics. However, it has never been defined and utilized in design as far\nas the generation of form is considered. The research aims to examine the validity and usefulness of a\nmulti-dimensional computation which integrates physical behavior (stress, strain, energy etc) as higher\ndimensional data attached to geometrical representation. Scalar maps as well as vector and higher rank\ntensor fields may potentially endow the design space with varying properties. Each voxel (pixel based\n\nResearch Objectives: Nature’s Strategies Recomputed 143\n\nparametric unit) is per definition non-identical to another and carries added material information in the\nform of a potential, or a set of directions.\n5.5\n\nResearch Issues: Design as Second Nature\n\n5.5.1\n\nMulti-Objective Design Fabrication\n\nIssues 1: What design model can support the negotiation and optimization between multiple performance\ncriteria (vs. the traditional single performance negotiation?)\nNatural systems are designed to correspond to multiple performance criteria such as structural loads and\nthermal pressures by means of varying the system’s properties in order to accommodate and negotiate\nbetween multiple parameters. Contrary to this approach, architectural design traditionally distinguishes\nmaterial substances by their particular function.\n5.5.2\n\nDesign without Representation\n\nIssue 2: Can form generation, evaluation and fabrication be computed in one integrated digital and\nphysical environment?\nIn Nature, form is the outcome of compounding the properties of a material substance with various types\nof environmental pressures forced upon it by Nature. Collectively, “material” and “environment” are\ncomputed to generate and optimize forms of organic substance.\nAs reviewed in Chapter 2 of this thesis, Nature’s ability to integrate processes of (form) generation,\nanalysis and fabrication guarantees that form is consistently optimized against external requirements\nand internal pressures. Precedents illustrating the shaping mechanisms that govern the form of trees\nand bones have been reviewed and it is my assumption that when processes of modeling, simulation,\nanalysis and fabrication are unified and consolidated into a coherent form of computation (such as the\none governing the formation and structural optimization of cancellous bone), that design reaches its most\nefficient and effective state; design become “natural”.\nIn light of such theoretical assumptions we are faced with questions regarding the nature of the design\nprocess. In Chapter 2 we have previously shown that when such processes are made sustainable by integrating shaping and fabrication, the products that such processes produce are in themselves sustainable\nas they utilize the structuring of material to correspond to multi-performance negotiation.\nHow, then, does one achieve the consolidation of parameters involved in the generation of form? Paraphrasing on more technical a note: how does one achieve the computational calibration of matter and\nenergy tied to create form without first creating form itself?\n5.5.3\n\nGraduated Properties Approach\n\nIssue 3: What is the role of variation and heterogeneity in nature and how does it promote a sustainable\napproach in the design of the artificial environment?\nWe seek to define what roles do variation and heterogeneity play in each of the disciplines reviewed in the\nintroductory chapters (biology in chapter 2, and material science and engineering in chapter 3). Here we\naim to focus on the mechanisms and methods used to assist and achieve the production of heterogeneous\nmaterial compositions that correspond to a multiplicity of environmental constraints?\n\n144 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\n5.5.4\n\nForm via Material\n\nIssue 4: How to prioritize material over shape in processes of design generation and design representation?\nThe image of the architect as form-giver has for centuries dominated our profession. In most cases, structural strategies are addressed by way of post-rationalization in support of the building’s utility captured\nby spatial properties. In this light, material selection and application are dependent on the structural\nsolutions. Such views emphasize the hierarchical nature of the design process with form being the first\narticle of production upon which both structural and material strategies are tailored. Gehry’s monumental architecture provides many such examples (Oxman 2007; Oxman 2008; oxman 2008). Parallel to a\n“form first” approach, and influenced by the work ethic of leading structural engineers such as ARUP\nand Buro Happold, an alternative schema prioritizes the function of structure as the main driver of formal\nexpression. “Structure first” is manifested particularly in projects of vast engineering complexity such\nas bridges and skyscrapers. Conversely, material has traditionally been regarded as a feature of form\nbut not its originator. In nature, it appears, the hierarchical sequence form-structure-material is inverted\nbottom-up as material informs structure which, in turn, informs the shape of naturally designed specimens. It appears that amongst the main contributions of Nature as a model for Design is an approach\nwhich favors matter (and materials) as a central and significant factor associated with the generation of\nform in the artificial world. Such is the case, for instance, with bones and other cellular structures the\nshape of which is directly informed by the materials from which they are made. In nature, in most cases,\nmaterial comes first. How can a “material first” approach be accommodated by design?\n5.6\n5.6.1\n\nResearch Questions\nNon-Binary Computation\n\nResearch question 1: Can computational units describing form include attributes additional to shape\n/ geometrical attributes such as stiffness (structural), thermal flow (environmental), transparency (phenomenological) etc?\nHow would such form-generation tools be developed to consider the incorporation of multiple properties,\nfor each of which are potentially assigned non-binary material properties gauging environmental variance\n(insofar as various environmental performance criteria are consider per a given heterogeneous material\nsubstance)?\nThe term “binary” is emblematic of the digital world. Take, for instance, any or most typical software\napplications in the design or the engineering milieu. As previously reviewed in Chapter 4 of this thesis,\nvarious such applications exist that support the designer in her mission to generate, simulate and analyze\na design. However, most computational media used today to perform such processes assume any geometrical feature to be devoid of any physical property altogether, at least in the very early stages of design.\nMaterial is typically assigned to geometrical features only after such features have been generated, and\nonce it is applied, such material is typically homogeneous in its properties; that is it does not vary its\nphysical properties across the surface or volume area of the object being modeled. A given material\nproperty is either defined or present or it is not. And, if indeed, material is assigned to a geometrical\nfeature it is generally defined by a set of properties that do not vary in value. Such is for instance the\ncase of assigning “glass”, “steel”, or “plastic” to an already geometrically described object.\nSuch binary approaches also provide the basis for analytical functions. As reviewed in Chapter 4, current state-of-the-art Finite Element applications afford the designer with sophisticated form-generation\nprocesses based on material properties and some iterative analysis algorithm. The effect, basically, is to\n\nResearch Questions 145\n\ngradually erode and omit any redundant material until the minimum amount necessary to perform the\nstructural talks is left (at which point the feature should be fully stressed). The algorithm then terminates.\nAgain, processes such as this one assume homogeneous material. The only possible element conditions,\nthen, are “full of material” or “devoid of material”. But what if, like the form of a leaf or a tree, one\ncould continuously vary any required property (e.g. varied stiffness across the height dimensions) and\nsimultaneously allow for the consideration of various properties per any given location (e.g. varied stiffness coupled with varied translucency). In this case, per any given object, one may assume the variation\nof a material property coupled with the consideration of multiple properties negotiated for that particular\nregion.\nSuch processes may potentially become particularly interesting when the designer is able to both generate\nand optimize a design against multiple performance criteria. Beyond the typical consideration of strength\nand structural optimization, the designer may also wish to incorporate environmental (e.g. insulation)\nand visual (e.g. transparency) properties, as well as other architecturally relevant properties of materials.\nThe research questions and assumptions regarding the design and production of objects that are the result\nof integrating material properties and environmental performance requirements, both in their non-binary\nmanifestations (as is the case in the natural world) are overwhelmingly challenging from both a conceptual, paradigmatic point of view, as well as the technical approaches and tools required for their\nrealization. However, the prospect, and potential implementation of such an approach are incredibly exciting, particularly when the designer is able to integrate physical parameters in the very early processes\nof form-generation.\nClearly, binary forms of computation are not sufficient for such research assumptions. New forms of\n“mulnary” design computation supporting the integration of material knowledge, must be further explored, developed and implemented.\n5.6.2\n\nUniversal Units\n\nResearch question 2: Can computational units describing form digitally be calibrated with physical units\ndescribing matter such that geometry units = environmental analysis units = fabrication units? How to\ndigitally represent units of matter and units of energy as equivalent units of form in order to integrate\nbetween modeling, analysis and fabrication?\nHow does one integrate between processes of modeling (geometry), analysis (structure) and fabrication\n(material)? Per a given volume and surface area, how can the physical units of matter be synchronized\nwith units of energy (“performance”) and units of computation (“bits”) in order to achieve such calibration?\nWe assume that if the units that are being used for geometrical modeling (i.e. “parametric cell” or\n“associative component”) are equivalent to both units of engineering analysis (i.e. “mesh element”) as\nwell as to units of digital fabrication (i.e. a singular powder molecule extruded by a 3D printer), and, in\naddition, such units are also equivalent to units of structural measurements (i.e. “load per surface area”)\nand environmental performance (i.e. “temperature per surface area”), then we arrive at a far-reaching\ncondition in which units of matter are equal to units of energy, both of which are equal to units of formal\nrepresentation!\nSuch desired calibration between units of modeling (digital matter), analysis (digital matter informed\nby physical constraints) and fabrication (physical matter) will ultimately result in an integrated design\nprocess that bears enormous implications for the state of design its discourse and its practice.\nWhat are the units used to describe and represent physical matter? How are digitally or physically\ndescribed materials units assembled or disassembled to form the final desired shape (i.e. additive, subtractive and growth-induced strategies?)\n\n146 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nWhat is the hierarchy that is established between modeling, analysis (and/or simulation) and fabrication?\nWhat are any interdependencies between the three processes and by which parameters are they characterized?\nCurrent rapid prototyping (RP) and Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) fabrication technologies\noffer high precision modeling in physical form. Most of these tools provide for scaled models only. The\nproposal will touch upon full scale rapid construction technologies which, combined with the Material\nComputation modeling approach, allow for local modification of material properties within the process\nof fabrication. State of the art (poly-jet matrix) technologies exist today which support multi-material\nprinting. At this time we are considering the application of a grant to include behavioral parameters\nwithin the printing process such that once printed, the physical model can potentially respond to local and global loads and other environmental pressures (see attached research proposal for the Holcim\nFoundation as an addenda to this research thesis).\n5.6.3\n\nStructure minus Material\n\nResearch question 3: What is the difference between material and structure in design?\nHow would such form-generation tools be developed to consider the variation of any given material property, thus affording the designer with internally heterogeneous material substance which corresponds to\nperformance requirements? When dealing with systems that incorporate variation and heterogeneity, how\nare functional hierarchies achieved, if at all? What is the difference between “material” and “structure”\nand how are they defined and distinguished within each knowledge domain?”\nThe distinction between “material” and “structure” is not an easy one when it comes to continuous\nnon-homogeneous substances. Let us attempt to replace the notion of material assembly with that of\nmaterial distribution. Such orientation points towards a shift in both method and meaning: rather than\nachieving functionality by the layering of materials and structures, we devise an integrated system able\nto modulate the quantities and qualities of its elements in order to achieve a heterogeneous range of\nmaterial effects. The distribution of properties across a surface or volume element (whether structural or\nmaterial) establishes differences in behavior that correspond to a range of performance types and degrees.\nThe proposal aims at classifying and defining such differences in building scale and how they may relate\nto performance analysis and form-generation.\n5.6.4\n\nDigital Materials\n\nResearch question 4: How can geometrical processes in the generation of form be inculcated with material properties data prior to the generation of form? How to represent material properties in the form\ngeneration process?\nCurrent CAD applications, including associative modeling software packages, appear frequently to promote generative approaches to design (Shea 2003). Rather than treating the computational media merely\nas an “output station” prior to production, the designer is now able to establish parametric relationships\nbetween features, methods and/or functions in ways which support design processes of an exploratory\nnature. However, this liberation which seems to be manifesting itself across the board throughout the continuous phases of the design process is currently mainly driven by geometrical constraints. Generative\nperformative modeling approaches have been introduced which engage principles of engineering with\nform-finding (Burry 2005). And yet, even when integrating performance factors and tools that are significant in determining architectural form, material organization and behavior are already pre-determined\ndesign constraints; predetermined factors. Form-finding, in the digital realm, is thus restricted to the relationship between structure and geometry (and/or fabrication); it does not generally incorporate, and/or\n\nResearch Questions 147\n\nsupport, the expression of material properties, organization and behavior.\nThis proposal seeks to establish a synergetic approach to design whereby material organization and behavior, as they may appear in the physical world, may be integrated into digital tools for design exploration. The approach is based on the premise that material, structure, and form can become inseparable\nentities of the design process which relate to matter, performance and geometry respectively. Beyond\nthis theoretical significance, the goal of the experiments presented here is to effectively link the simulation/computational techniques across adjacent scales of physical behavior so that microscopic level\nphysics and mechanisms are incorporated into the description of properties and behavior at the mesoscopic (micro-structural) level, and beyond that, in order to suggest descriptive attributes even at macro\nscale.\n5.7\n5.7.1\n\nMethodological set up and preparation for the next chapter: “methodological platforms”\nInterdisciplinary Research\n\nBy revealing the many aspects of this question, devising knowledge from the disciplines of geometry,\nmaterial science, and design computation, we seek to demonstrate that such integration is useful and\npotentially revolutionary in the field of design.\n5.7.2\n\nExperimental Research\n\nThe research approach is experimental in nature: models are generated and tested in parallel to small\nscale physical prototypes that will validate and allow for the evaluation of the research aims and goals\n(Figure 5.3).\n5.7.3\n\nConvergent Technologies\n\nWe will gather interdisciplinary knowledge that supports the development of a seamless analog computation. In this process we will consider existing models that are currently being used for evaluation and/or\noptimization processes and attempt to integrate them into bottom up processes of form-generation, as\nopposed to top-bottom analytical procedures.\n5.8\n\nSummary: Methodological Frameworks on the way to Material-based Design Computation\n\nThe chapters preceding this one have served as the introductory chapters to the interdisciplinary field\nof Material-based Design Computation as told from the point of view of various knowledge domains I\nfound to be of particular relevance to this research. Chapters 2, 3 and 4 focus on ideas from the fields\nof biology, material science, and design computation respectively that are instructive to the mapping of\ntheoretical and technical knowledge presented in this thesis.\nIn the following chapter I provide a brief overview of concepts relevant to the mapping of the theoretical\nfoundations of this thesis, classified by their knowledge domain. Combined, the collection of issues\nprovide for the groundwork underlying the field of Material-based Design Computation. Each issue,\nfor which a set of sub-queries has been laid out below, addresses the two significant research questions\nreviewed in the introductory section of this chapter: the multifunctional product, and the integrated\ndesign process.\nAs part of the methodological set-up some existing computational applications were used, applied and\nmanipulated that provide for interesting analytical functions. Such functions were identified as carrying\n\n148 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\npotential significance in terms of their capacity to contribute to, and inspire, form-generation processes\ndriven by physical constraints.\nWhen exploring the generative capacity of analysis packages, the aim was to identify procedural modeling issues that may be re-appropriated in processes of form-generation. In addition, natural tissues were\ninvestigated in order to better characterize the definition and potential manipulation of material properties\nand their relation to particular performance criteria.\nOptimization processes are usually performed in conjunction with protocols of, and for, evaluation. Once\npreliminary formal schematics have been laid out, an algorithm is devised which is designed in order to\nminimize or maximize a given function by systematically choosing variables from within an allowed\nset. So once the object upon which to optimize, and the objective function defining what and how the\noptimization should take place, we enter an iterative refinement process controlled by the designer. In\nthis research we propose that the iterative nature of optimization processes, and their ability to integrate\nevaluative constraints with existing mathematical data, may be applied in design bottom-up on the way\ntowards Material-based Design Computation.\n\nFigures 149\n\nFigure 5.1: The diagram illustrates how various design motivations may be integrated to inform performancebased design. Considerations from the domain of geometry, materiality, fabrication, assembly logic, behavior and\nenvironment (with some overlaps) are juxtaposed to direct the form-generation process. The underlying assumption\nis that the ideal design process integrates between modeling, analysis and fabrication constraints during the formgeneration processes, rather than conceiving of such processes as linearly dependent.\n\n150 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nFigure 5.2: Much of the work presented in this thesis follows from the assumption that form is generated through\nthe interaction between material and environment, and that various environmental conditions yield various material\nmanifestations that may fit the designer’s goals and constraints. The diagrams above were used to negotiate between\n6 performance criteria in 6 distinct conditions requiring different material interventions that may respond and satisfy\n“environmental customization”.\n\nFigures 151\n\nFigure 5.3: Each design experiment presented in this thesis demonstrates some combination between shape, performance and the type of media used to explore this interaction. Under the “performance” rubric are included external and internal performance criteria relating to constraints\nthat are defined as either independent or dependent on the physical material used, respectively.\nUnder the “form” rubric are included parameters in or of relation to geometry, structure and/or\nmaterial. Under the “media” rubric are included the type of media used to explore and execute\nthe experiment, whether through digital or physical means or whether through some combination\nof those tools. Each experiment explores the relation between 2 or more elements of this process\ndiagram.\n\n152 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nMATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\nMethodological Frameworks\n“Up your scale. Each pixel a million megabytes”\n— William Gibson (Neuromancer)\n\n6.1\n\nIntroduction: Material Form and its Methodological Frameworks\n\nThe dominance of the geometrical representation of design content has for centuries, prior to the use of\ncomputers, contributed to a geometry-centric approach in the design of products, buildings and cities.\nAccordingly, form must first be first conceived in order to be constructed. Naturally, it is unfeasible\n(theoretically or technically) for processes of conception and construction to occur concurrently. Predictably, design since the time of the pyramids, has been driven by its many forms of expression defined\nand conveyed in geometrical terms. Material is consistently secondary in this milieu; and it is due to\nthe priority of geometrical representation over physical material considerations, a phenomenon that has\nled to stream-lining the design process: form first, material later. By methodological extension design\nconception is to be followed by analysis, simulation, and fabrication. Indeed, how can the fabrication of\nform be manifest without form’s conception?\nWe have seen that Nature’s way is uniquely different. In nature, forms are the result of the matching\nbetween material parameters and their corresponding environmental constraints. Shape is then merely a\nby-product, a derivative of natural behavioral formation. It emerges as an effect exclusive to its particular\nenvironmental template. In nature, we have established, form’s geometry is predominantly determined\nby the interaction between material and environment6.1 .\nThe implications of this interpretation of nature’s approach are immense inasmuch as values of sustainability are consequential to the state of habitat. By guiding the emergence of form to be reliant on the\n6.1\n\nIt goes without saying, that the observation of natural structures is time-dependant; growth, and the significance of its\ncontribution to formal transformation and adaptation in nature must not be neglected. In the scope of this thesis, however, I\nchoose to treat my observations into nature as moments frozen in time as it were, where the interaction between material and\nenvironmental constraints presented at the time of investigation are considered as relevant.\n\nIntroduction: Material Form and its Methodological Frameworks 153\n\ninteraction between material and environment, not without the aid of growth and adaptive mechanisms,\nnature guarantees and promotes environmental fitness, material efficiency and structural economy all\nglowingly suitable as relevant candidates for inclusion in the treatise of Natural Design. Is nature’s way\nsuitable as a model for the design of the artificial?\nGiven this assumption as a scientific motivation, and, given that we have arrived at the point at which\nsuch objectives must now be technically articulated through various disciplinary sources relevant to its\nvalidation, how can we then represent the interaction between material and environment such that any\nresulting form is perfectly attuned to its environmentally prescribed fitness? We must now define a new\nparadigm of form generation that is capable of achieving such a vaunted objective.\nMaterial-based Design Computation is hereto postulated and demonstrated as a potentially new field\nin Computer-Aided Architectural Design, with clear orientation towards that which may be defined as\nsustainable. The theory of natural design as first formulated in the introductory chapter is outlined below\nas a proposal theoretical in its nature; it is supported by a scientific approach which has enabled the\nexperimentation and evaluation that is described in the following chapters.\n6.2\n\nOrganization\n\nThe chapter is organized around a set of methodological frameworks that correspond to issues and problems introduced in the previous chapter. This also provides the presentation of the methods applied to\ngenerate and evaluate the design experiments illustrated in the following chapter. These methodological\nframeworks focus on the two reoccurring themes that were identified as emblematic of natural design:\nthe multi-functional artifact and the exploitation of an integrated conception-construction process.\n6.2.1\n\nTransparent Stone: the Search for the Multi-Functional Artifact\n\nMethods were developed that support the design of multi-functional products and building elements. It\nis in the multi-functional condition that variations of material properties and composition correspond\ndirectly to specific structural and environmental constraints. This approach to design, supporting multifunctionality over discrete utility through the promotion of heterogeneity over homogeneity, seeks to\nadvance and embrace strategies of material distribution over strategies of material assembly.\nThe methods presented here include strategies for the manipulation of matter in precise directions within\nthe surface area or volume of the design object so as to best adapt it to its mechanical, thermal and optical functions within a given context. As we have observed, in nature fibers and tissues are strategically\noriented so as to best cope with the mechanical stresses and strains acting upon them. Similarly, computational modeling units may potentially be assigned physical properties, and strategically distributed to\nmatch any such template comprised of environmental constraints.\n6.2.2\n\nFAB as you go: The Search for the Multi-Procedural Technology\n\nAny design manipulation of physical matter represented in the digital realm assumes the integration of\nsynthetic (i.e. modeling & fabrication) and analytic (i.e. simulation) functions and processes. In order\nto achieve design strategies of material distribution, and in order that such strategies will indeed carry\nadded value over strategies of material assemblies, new computational processes must be developed and\nimplemented which support the integration of modeling, analysis and fabrication not as sequential hierarchical processes, but rather as an integrated multi-procedural holistic method not unlike that occurring\nin the case of human bone formation.\n\n154 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\n6.3\n\nMethodological Frameworks\n\n6.3.1\n\nVariable Property Design (VPD)\n\nVariable Property Design is proposed as the set of processes enabling the distribution of materials and\ntheir properties in the design of a product or a building. These processes are informed by functional,\nstructural, and environmental constraints. VPD is a therefore a design approach, a methodology, and a\ntechnical framework, by which to model, simulate and fabricate functional material organization with\nvarying properties designed to correspond to multiple and continuously varying functional constraints.\nSuch framework includes processes of modeling, analysis and fabrication. Within each process, certain\nmethods have been identified which carry the potential to rethink design not as form-driven, but rather\nas a behavioral-driven paradigm that may potentially achieve a natural design.\nVariable Property Design (VPD) includes the sub-processes of Variable Property Modeling; Variable\nProperty Analysis and Variable Property Fabrication. These are defined below.\n6.3.2\n\nDigital Anisotropy: Creating Methods for Material Distribution\n\nNature’s artifacts are all anisotropic. Defined as the property of having different values when measured in\ndifferent directions, anisotropy is central to determining how natural objects are shaped relative to their\nfunction and behavior. In design terms, such an ambition appears almost contradictory to nature’s way.\nFor example, in architectural CAD, materials assigned to digital data generally lack internal physical\ndirectionality due to computational limitations. It is therefore imperative to establish form-generation\nprocesses supporting the internal distribution of materials and their properties as a function of any anticipated forces mapped onto the object.\nDigital Anisotropy is a term coined by the author to denote the designer’s ability to strategically control the density and directionality of material substance in the generation of form. In this approach,\nmaterial precedes shape, and it is the structuring of material properties as a function of environmental performance-requirements that precedes, and furthermore, anticipates their form. Defined below are\nthree classes of Digital Anisotropy. Each class is distinguished from the others by the way in which it\npromotes material directionality changes across various scales whether through organizational variation\nor through property variation.\n6.3.2.1\n\nDistribution-driven Digital Anisotropy\n\nIn the case of Distribution-driven Digital Anisotropy directionality changes are achieved by generating\norganizational variations in material distribution. Here it is assumed that material properties are homogeneous and constant across the surface area or volume of the object (Figure 6.1).\nFor example, bone tissue is made up of similar material composition (calcium and phosphorus) across\nvarious regions of the body. However its mechanical anisotropy is achieved by the arrangement of an\nirregular lattice work constituting the interior structure of the bone. Those lattices which are made of\ncomparatively homogeneous material are references to the forces acting upon them. One may consider\nthis arrangement of studs and braces as a “structure”, but when seen from the point of view of “material\ndistribution”, this case is a perfect example of distribution-driven anisotropy. It is comprised of homogeneous material and may or may not be considered a structure depending on its scale and mechanical\nfunction6.2 .\n6.2\n\nThe reader is encouraged to refer to the technical definitions of anisotropy, further coupled with case studies from the\ndomains of physical sciences and biology. More about the human bone, and the debate introduced regarding the dichotomy\nbetween material and structure as scale-driven definitions is provided in chapters 2 and 3.\n\nMethodological Frameworks 155\n\nIn computational terms, digital anisotropy may be achieved by considering the units of digital data as\nhomogeneous in properties. Their arrangement is conceptually analogous to the arrangement of cellular\nsolids forming a functional structure, say any imaginable type of foam-like structure. However, their\n“digital assembly” strategy may vary depending on the way in which two or more units are attached and\nconnected (e.g. with or without overlaps, with or without the application of a computational algorithm\nfor their arrangement, etc).\nIt is important to note that in nature, anisotropy is typically achieved by directionality changes (such is\nthe case of fiber arrangement in wood). However, such changes are essentially made of the same material\nand are considered homogeneous in computational terms given that the computational units describing\nmatter are symmetrical. As a result, the emergence of fiber directionality in the digital realm may be\nprompted by the serial arrangement of units to form fiber-like longitudinal structures.\n6.3.2.2\n\nProperty-driven Digital Anisotropy\n\nIn the case of Property-driven Digital Anisotropy directionality changes are achieved by facilitating\nproperty variations in material definition. Here it is assumed that material properties are heterogeneous\nand vary across the surface area, or volume, of the object. For example, muscle tissue may be classified\nas skeletal, smooth, or cardiac depending on the tissue’s chemical composition. Local modifications\nmay be observed in different body locations which are characterized by muscle property variation. In\nthis case, mechanical anisotropy is achieved by the specific physical properties of muscle fibers and their\n(physiological) assembly strategies. Those bundles, which are made of comparatively heterogeneous\nmaterial, correspond, again, to the forces acting upon them. This case is characteristic of property-driven\nanisotropy. It is comprised of heterogeneous material and may or may not be considered a structure\ndepending on its scale and mechanical function.\nIn computational terms, such digital anisotropy may be achieved by considering the units of digital\ndata as heterogeneous in properties. These may include property variations associated with mechanical\nfunctionality (i.e. strength and stiffness), visual functionality (i.e. multiple levels of transparency), and\nacoustical functionality (i.e. multiple levels of insulation capacity) or combinations of such parameters\nand their assortments (Figure 6.2).\n6.3.2.3\n\nProperty Distribution-driven Digital Anisotropy\n\nIn the case of Property Distribution-driven Digital Anisotropy directionality changes are achieved by\nfacilitating combinations of property and distribution variations in material definition. Here it is assumed\nthat material properties are, overall, heterogeneous (with local regions that may potentially be comprised\nof homogeneous material) and vary in location and magnitude (more or less stiff, more or less isolative)\nacross the surface area, or volume, of the object.\nGiven nature’s chemical and physical complexity, it is therefore no surprise that this class is emblematic\nof most natural structures. Combined, fiber directionality, chemical composition and cell arrangement\nwithin the tissue and organ level (as a function of their anticipated performance) all contribute to the\noverall functional and mechanical anisotropy of the structure.\nIn computational terms, this case represents a composite circumstance in which both directionality and\nproperty changes apply. In other words, computational units are both strategically arranged to form\nmicro- or macro-structures as well as vary in properties depending on their location within the structure.\nClearly, this class presents computational counterparts for material distribution strategies in Nature that\nare most challenging to develop in terms of the tools, techniques and technologies currently available to\nthe architect and the designer (Figure 6.3).\n\n156 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\n6.3.3\n\nDigital Matter 1: Defining a Material Unit\n\nWhen considering the computational encoding of material data it is important to distinguish between two\nclasses of material units.\n6.3.3.1\n\nSymmetrical (Isotropic) Cells: Grains\n\nIn this research, in analogy to the physical sciences, grains are defined as, and considered translational\nsymmetrical6.3 . Not unlike equally sized and formed cells combined in some meaningful way to form a\nlarger lattice system, grains are equivalent to the three-dimensional pixel, or the voxel, scaled down to a\npictorial-representation of a digital unit (Figure 6.4).\n6.3.3.2\n\nAsymmetrical (Anisotropic) Cells: Fibers\n\nFibers are considered reflection symmetrical6.4 . Like natural fibers of various length scales and dimensions, digital fibers are geometrically defined as components containing longitudinal directionality. In\nthis research, due to their geometrical affinity with voxels, we refer to voxels (“digital grains”) as the\nbuilding blocks of digital matter. Similarly, fibers or any form of organizational directionality may be\ninformed by the strategic distribution of grains (Figure 6.5).\n6.3.4\n\nDigital Matter 2: Defining a Computational Material Unit\n\nThe shape and size of a computational unit may vary depending on the type of representation used to\ngenerate it. In the case of an already existing geometrical entity, the computational unit may be used\nto quantify units of physical matter for purposes of evaluation. One must therefore distinguish between\nprocesses that define such material units during form-generation and processes that define them by means\nof analysis and evaluation. Regardless, in order to understand the theory and methods of Material-based\nDesign Computation it is imperative to first review and presents its foundations and initial assumptions.\nWe provide three definitions of computational material units classified by the type of computational\nprocess at hand. The unit’s shape, size and topology may vary depending on its definition. Later, we will\nattempt to integrate between these three class representations with the aim of introducing a new design\napproach enabling the simultaneous generation, analysis and fabrication of physical form.\nIt is important to note that common to all methods described below is the notion of form discretization as a way of post-rationalizing an already existing artifact. In order to examine the potential for\nform-generation processes to emerge by coupling material and environmental constraints from an initial condition that may be defined as “blank slate” (or, blank canvas!), we must first understand how\nsuch processes are being addressed within the sub-domains comprising the design process, namely the\ndomains of (a) modeling, (b) analysis and (c) fabrication.\n\n6.3\n\nTranslational symmetry leaves an object invariant under a discrete or continuous group of translations.\nReflection symmetry, mirror symmetry, mirror-image symmetry, or bilateral symmetry is symmetry with respect to reflection.\n6.4\n\nMethodological Frameworks 157\n\n6.3.4.1\n\nModeling Definition (CAD): Material Tessellation Unit\n\nIn Chapter 4 we defined tessellation as the process of subdividing a surface into smaller elements geometrically congruent to their neighbors. The size and topology of each geometrical unit may vary\ndepending on the size and topology of the surface or volume being tessellated. For example, doubly\ncurved B-Spline surfaces may be tessellated into doubly-curved tiles, ruled surfaces may be divided into\nsmaller ruled surfaced components, and so on.\nFrom a modeling perspective, tessellations are clearly of major relevance as they provide for methods\nof post-rationalizing any geometrically-generated objects from digital conception to physical fabrication\n(Figure 6.6). Three regular tessellations composed of regular polygons are known to symmetrically tile\na plane. Tessellations of the plane by two or more convex regular polygons, such that the same polygons\nin the same order surround each polygon vertex, are called semi-regular tessellations, or sometimes,\nArchimedean tessellations. In the plane, there are eight such tessellations. Simple and relatively known\nexamples of surface tessellation are square and hexagonal tiling. Examples that are more complex include Penrose tiling; randomly colored, uniform polygon tiles; or hexagons and pentagons that compose\na Buckminster sphere. In Chapter 4 we distinguished between tiling of regular polygons (in 2-D), polyhedrals (in 3-D) and polytopes (for n dimensions). A tessellation unit is therefore geometrically defined.\nAs such, it may contain information regarding local (a singular unit), regional (multiple units) or global\n(all units) curvature, but it does not typically designate physical properties, or behavior.\nIn order for a tessellation unit to incorporate physical material properties, a proper relation must be\nestablished between the tessellation strategy (size, shape, topology and organization) and the physical\nrequirements such that a correlation between form and behavior might be established. In this case, the\nresult will yield material tessellation units that are essentially geometrical entities encoded with physicalbehavioral information.\n6.3.4.2\n\nAnalysis Definition (FEA): Material Mesh Unit\n\nMesh discretization allows the designer to subdivide a continuous mathematical domain into a set of\ndiscrete sub-domains referred to as elements and represented as singular geometrical entities. Lattices\nand triangulations are common rationalization discretization techniques, where quadrant and triangulated\nelements may respectively wrap the surface area or volume of the object. Contrary to units defined\nonly via geometrical tessellation, analytical subdivision strategies are typically driven by structural, and\nother related types of, performance. Such structural meshes are used by engineers in order to simulate\nstructural loads, analyze their distribution and predict any potential displacements that may arise as a\nresult, for instance, of vertical, lateral, or torsional loads (Figure 6.7).\nMore recently, engineers are utilizing mesh-free algorithms in order to post-rationalize a given 3-D form\nin the process of translating it from the digital domain to its material manifestation via appropriate fabrication routines. Such mesh-free methods, as we have seen in Chapter 4, eliminate some, or all, of the\ntraditional mesh-based view of the computational domain and rely on a particle view of a field problem.\nMesh-free methods offer, therefore, an alternative for rationalizing volumes and surfaces by conceiving\nof them as continuous fields of particles which may potentially carry material data (Figures 6.8-6.12).\nIn both cases (mesh, or mesh-free oriented methods), one may consider the perfect alignment between\nform and material behavior by calibrating the size, shape and proximity of the element (whether a quad,\ntriangle, or “particle”) to the size and shape of the material unit from which the form is to be fabricated.\nImagine, for example, that the size of a mesh-free particle applied for the purpose of structural analysis\nprecisely matches the size of an imaginable powder molecule, or more realistically speaking a material aggregate providing for the substance of the 3D printing process. As we shall soon discover, the\n\n158 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nimplications of such a methodological/technological alignment seem quite enormous.\n6.3.4.3\n\nFabrication Definition (FGM): Material Maxel Unit\n\nAs previously reviewed in Chapter 4, the basic unit for Functionally Gradient Materials (FGM’s) representation is the maxel. The rendition of the term relates to additive fabrication processes and is used\nto describe a physical voxel which defines the build resolution6.5 of either a rapid prototyping, or rapid\nmanufacturing, process, or the resolution of a design produced by such fabrication means.\nThe maxel unit can be thought of as an intermediary representation linking the digital form to its physical\nmanifestation, particularly when rapid fabrication processes are considered. In this respect, the maxel\nprovides for a lower limit material definition establishing the degree of granularity required to manifest\nthree dimensional details of the design. From here, it is relatively easy to imagine the implications of\nusing maxels as the units used for calibrating voxels and printing powder. In this case the designer would\nbe modeling 3-D form using the units used to describe its physical manifestation.\n6.3.5\n\nDigital Matter 3: Defining a Material Organization\n\nWhen considering a unit definition of matter, it is important to also consider any boundary definitions\nof the unit and the way in which multiple units are connected. For instance, a triangulated unit may be\npart of some tetrahedral unit such that one unit is shared by two tetrahedral units. Clearly, there exist\nnumerous ways by which to define and inform the cellular organization of units subdividing a given 3-D\nsurface or volume. Not unlike the case in nature, such cellular tissues are typically made of an ensemble\nof cells. Cells are not necessarily identical, but from the same origin and together carry out a specific\nfunction.\n6.3.5.1\n\nModeling Definition (CAD): Tessellation Tissue\n\nWhen considered from a geometric modeling perspective, the subdivision of a geometrical entity typically serves to rationalize the surface for fabrication purposes. In this case, each “unit” or “cell” serves\nas a material component the size and curvature of which is dependent on the material and fabrication\nmethod applied. The unit’s edges are used to define geometrical continuity such that for highly curved\nsurfaces, smaller cells are assigned and for areas of relatively smooth curvature larger cells are assigned.\nIt is important to re-emphasize that aside from surface rationalization for fabrication purposes, such\nsubdivision units contain no material, or behavioral, parameters.\n6.3.5.2\n\nAnalysis Definition (FEA): Mesh Tissue\n\nTied to an analytical framework, meshes constructed for structural or environmental analyses are, by\ntheir very nature, subsidiary to formal generation. In Chapter 4 we reviewed a variety of techniques to\nconsider the design object as one which is made out of multiple smaller units, the size, color and shape\nof which are determined as a function of the type of performance being evaluated. In this case, the\nsubdivision is inherent in both the geometry and the objective functions driving the design.\n6.5\nThe “build resolution” is a term used to denote the granularity of a rapid prototyped part using additive fabrication technologies. The desired build resolution is typically determined by the thinnest section in the X-Y directions throughout the part\n(generally wall thickness or surface features); the thinnest section in the Z direction. This includes the depth of engraved or\nraised lettering; the overall size of the part; and the final appearance required for the part. The factors determining the resolution\ntypically include the thickness of each layer or slice through the CAD model, and the diameter of the laser spot used to draw\neach layer. Combined, these two factors will determine the smallest feature, or thinnest wall, a given resolution will create.\n\nMethodological Frameworks 159\n\nThe goal here is to subdivide the design object such that its analysis might satisfy certain performance\nconstraints. Unlike the previous example, where units are defined purely by their geometrical nature, in\nthe case of structural analysis each unit, or element, carries with it specific performance data associated\nwith internal material properties (e.g. stiffness) and external environmental conditions (e.g. strain due to\nload).\n6.3.5.3\n\nFabrication Definition (FGM): Maxel Tissue\n\nOver-scaled, the aggregation of powder grains produced for purposes of rapid fabrication, might appear\nto the observer as a large pile of oversized molecules randomly arranged, arbitrarily ordered and bonded\nwith adhesive resin. In real life, these homogeneous material molecules are used as the “build material”\nfor the rapid prototyped model.\nAs previously reviewed in Chapter 4, the basic unit used for the representation of functionally gradient\nmaterials is the maxel typically defined by the location and volume fraction of individual material components. In fabrication terms, the maxel is used to describe a physical voxel the size of which defines\nthe build resolution of a design produced by means of rapid prototyping. For example, in the case of\nfunctionally gradient materials, a finite element analysis (FEA) application may be applied which uses a\ntriangulated or quadrilateral mesh within which each element is defined by its own structural properties\nand the size of the element is defined by the fabrication plotter resolution. In this case, all units representing the different stages of modeling, analysis and fabrication are aligned and calibrated. Assuming\nthat units of modeling (tessellation) may indeed be calibrated with units of analysis (mesh) and units of\nfabrication (material atoms), the generation of form might become synonymous with growth.\n6.3.6\n\nDigital Assembly: Approaches for Digital Anisotropy of Digital Matter\n\nAmid the representation of material and structure across various scales and media (e.g. modeling, analysis and fabrication), it is relatively easy to imagine how design information may be “lost in translation”.\nOnce the object has been geometrically defined and expressed, through its post-rationalization and towards its materialization, the designer moves freely between units of geometrical form, units of analytical\ncomputation and units of physical matter. What if we were to assume that all design units are calibrated\nacross media? And, what if following such an assumption, a design object could be described in fabricating terms simultaneous to its being analyzed? (Figure 6.17) Can designs be “grown” to accommodate\nenvironmental conditions? As how material is defined and expressed within each of these media becomes\nradically reformulated, could such an attempt for the universal calibration of matter yield a new way of\nthinking and making design?\nThe following methodological frameworks were created for the purpose of experimenting with the idea\nof universal material calibration in search for a natural way in, and for, design. Entitled Tiling Behavior\n(TB), Finite Synthesis Method (FSM), and Variable Property Fabrication (VPF), each such methodological framework refers to a distinct representational media respectively including modeling (material-based\ntessellation), analysis (material-based simulation) and fabrication (material-based prototyping) computational platforms associated with material-based design computation processes.\n6.3.6.1\n\nGenerative Modeling: Tiling Behavior\n\nPatterns in nature often inspire textures and patterns in architectural and design domains. However, in\nthe synthetic world geometrical considerations preceded material choice. Tiling Behavior proposes a\nmaterial-based approach to tiling, whereby each tile, or group of tiles, represent various material properties as an integral part of the form-generation process. Tiling Behavior (Oxman 2009) questions the\n\n160 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nrole of tiling as a rationalizing method and offers an alternative theoretical framework and technical\ngrounding for processes of material-based tessellation.\nThe technical objective is to introduce a quantitative characterization of property mapping, as it may\npotentially be applied to a tiling algorithm using some tessellation routine, for example voronoi tessellation6.6 . In this research framework, the network of tessellated Voronoi cells is used as an element in the\nVoronoi Finite Element Method (V-FEM) developed by the author and presented in the following chapter. Various characterization functions and geometric parameters are generated, and V-FEM is executed\nfor plane-strain analysis of doubly curved surfaces, from which global and local responses are evaluated\n(Oxman 2009).\nThe aim is to establish processes of surface tessellation as rudimentary to form generation by postulating\nthat tessellation algorithms could and should include physical data that is expressed geometrically. By\nconsidering parameters such as variable stiffness as functions informing the design of complex form, the\nwork offers a theoretical and technical approach to tiling behavior (Oxman 2009).\nThe work proposed and developed here introduces the concept of tiling behavior as a theoretical framework, a methodological setup, and a technical approach that extends its role as rationalizing technique\nbeyond geometrical representation. This work demonstrates tiling behavior through the development of\ncomputational tools that include material properties and their assignment to corresponding structural and\nenvironmental performance data (Figure 6.13).\n6.3.6.2\n\nGenerative Analysis: Finite Synthesis Method (FSM)\n\nThe basic iterative algorithm for finite element optimization is based on reducing material concentration\nwhere it is not required for purposes of structural or mechanical performance (such purposes are, of\ncourse, defined by the objective function). In other words, if we begin the design process with a solid\nblock of material and specified load conditions, then following this procedure, stress distribution is recalculated and elements with minimum stress values are removed. This process is applied to a specific\nobjective function (i.e. structural optimization) while assuming a relatively homogeneous material distribution. The optimization algorithm, which may be combined with certain Genetic Algorithm (GA)\nfunctions to assist with fitness evaluation, considers binary functions (“retain, or remove, material”) at\nthe scale of the element.\nSimplified, the basic iterative algorithm for finite element structural optimization operates as follows:\n1. Begin with solid block of material and specified load conditions;\n2. Run finite element analysis to calculate stress distribution;\n3. Check for any elements at less than maximum allowable stress;\n4. If no, then terminate, otherwise;\n5. Remove some of the lowest-stressed elements;\n6. Go to 2.\nThe effect, basically, is to eat away redundant material until the minimum amount necessary to perform\nthe structural task is left (at which point, all material left should be fully stressed). The algorithm then\n6.6\n\nVoronoi tessellation is a geometric dual of Delaunay triangulation and one can be derived from the other. Given a set of\nN points in a plane, Voronoi tessellation divides the domain into a set of polygonal regions, the boundaries of which are the\nperpendicular bisectors of the lines joining the points.\n\nMethodological Frameworks 161\n\nterminates. Such typical algorithm assumes homogeneous material (Figure 6.14). The only possible\nelement conditions, then, are “full of material” or “empty”. However, the designer may potentially\ndecide to vary material properties of an element (e.g. variable-density metal foam), such that the element\nproperties can continuously vary from 0 (empty, no material) to 1 (full of the strongest available material),\nthus generating heterogeneous material organizations. Accordingly, the final steps in the algorithm would\ngradually reduce the strength of some of the least load-bearing elements.\nGiven this highly innovative ability to synthesize and control material distribution, the experimental research based on this methodological platform develops and investigates architectural forms that become\npossible when we can continuously vary material properties. This becomes particularly significant in\nconsidering not only strength and structural optimization, but also insulating properties, transparency,\nand other architecturally relevant properties of materials which can be optimized against multiple performance criteria.\nIn this methodological framework, we propose a general approach to the problem of computational\nform-generation of shapes with continuously varied material properties satisfying prescribed material\nconditions on a finite collection of material features and global constraints. The fundamental approach\nis guided by the conversion of the analytical process into a synthetic one. In other words, the aim is to\napply the logic and computation of finite element approaches to the problem of design synthesis, rather\nthan design analysis.\nSuch a process requires that the designer redefines the analytical unit and mesh components as synthetic\ncellular entities which are further connected, combined, “grown” or woven to form a surface, or volume,\nbased on the integration of internal material properties and external environmental constraints. It is\nchallenging to imagine how this may be achieved without an initial state (i.e. a boundary solution). Such\na state might simply be assumed to be the initial volume of material assumed prior to the application of\nsite forces considered, e.g. an initial state defined by a homogeneous cube of given size and properties.\nFrom here it follows that the parameterization of shape may be guided by both the subsistence of material\n(per given material unit, material is either present or eliminated) and its various potential qualities with\ntheir proposed ranges (e.g. from hard to soft, from opaque to translucent, and so on).\nThis proposed framework is inspired by problems of heterogeneous material modeling in the fields of\nmaterial science and computer-aided geometric modeling as it may potentially be applied to larger scales\nin design and architecture. It is theoretically complete in the sense that it supports the representation of\nall potential material property functions while considering only the most generic parameters regarding\nmechanical behavior, environmental impact, and spatial or visual effect. More specifically, the aim is to\ngenerate 3D forms that correspond to a given set of performance requirements which are then mapped\nand computed as material properties. For example, a pattern representing wind-load conditions may\npotentially be mapped to a given material with specific physical properties. This will generate the initial\nsolid volume element (Figures 6.15, 6.16).\nThe experiments under this rubric are considered synthetic insofar that analytic data is used to further\ndevelop and generate the 3D form. Granted, the designer does not begin with a “blank slate” situation,\nbut rather, natural structural specimens are, in certain of the experiments, used as the initiating “material”. In other words, rather than generating 3D form from an initial homogeneous chunk of material,\nstructural and organizational models are derived from scanned micrographs of natural structures and are\nfurther reconstructed by computing their hypothetical physical response. In each case, a computational\nexperiment is performed that accounts for physical responses to structural components in the original\nimage.\nWe use the Object Oriented Finite Element Analysis (OOF) environment as the methodological foundations for these experiments. As reviewed in Chapter 4 of this thesis, the OOF environment was developed\n\n162 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nat MIT’s Department of Material Science and Engineering in collaboration with NIST (National Institute\nof Standards and Technology), for analyzing the effects of microstructure on material properties. It is\nunique in that it combines a finite element method together with material properties. It serves to predict\nmaterial behavior under a range of objective functions defined by the user such that given a 2-D image\nof the specimen, one can analyze its physical behavior based on a hypothetical assignment of physical\nproperties to geometrical attributes (Carter, Langer et al. 1998; Carter 2010).\nThe computation is performed using an image-based finite element application. Physical properties are\nimposed onto the image after which a computational mesh is created which includes the image-property\ninformation. The computation produced various data sets including stress and strain data, heat flow,\nstored energy, and deformation due to applied loads and temperature differences. The results are spatially\nanalyzed and converted to a constructible data structure using Mathematica.\nThe input files include micrographs and simulations using all available micro-structural data with no\nmean-field approximations. Constitutive relations which translate stresses into strains using Young’s\nmodulus are defined by the user. OOF converts an image, or a micrograph, of a heterogeneous, multicomponent material into a finite element mesh with constitutive properties specified by the user. It is a\ntool to test physical properties and to investigate the influence of microstructure on macroscopic behavior,\nvia finite element analysis.\n6.3.6.3\n\nGenerative Fabrication: Variable Property Fabrication (VPF)\n\nWe propose to integrate the material-computation design environment which has been described with\na direct fabrication capability. Currently, there exists no rapid prototyping technology which allows\nfor a continuous modification of material properties such as strength, stiffness, density and elasticity as\ncontinuous gradients across the surface and volume area of a functional component. Such variations are\nusually achieved as discrete changes in physical behavior by printing multiple components with different\nproperties and definite delineations between materials, and assembling them only after the fabrication\nprocess has been completed. Such processes result in material waste and lack of functional precision.\nVariable Property Fabrication (VPF) aims at proposing a novel material deposition 3-D printing technology which offers gradation control of multiple materials within one print to save weight and material\nquantity while reducing energy input. The result is a continuous gradient material structure, highly optimized to fit its structural performance with an efficient use of materials, reduction of waste and the\nproduction of highly customized features with added functionalities.\nFrom a fabrication point of view two methodological frameworks are considered that aim at the following:\n1. Product framework: Fabrication with variable density and elasticity properties as opposed to the\nfabrication of discrete components, each with homogeneous materials and properties.\n2. Process framework: Integration of environmental performance data as part of the fabrication process. For instance: structural load mapping simulated in an FM environment is mapped on top of\nthe fabrication software which, in turn, informs property distribution in the printing process.\nThe first methodological framework (1) is product-oriented and as such, it may be applied in a traditional\ndesign context in which there is a separation between modeling, analysis and fabrication processes. If\nwell achieved, it is considered as a novel fabrication technology which can potentially 3D print any given\ndesign (within a certain scale limit) with variable properties as defined by the user.\nThe second methodological framework (2) is process-oriented and as such, it promotes a novel approach\nto the design of objects informed by their environment. Assuming that a full calibration may indeed\n\nMethodological Frameworks 163\n\nbe achieved between modeling, analysis and fabrication units describing and depicting the distribution\nof matter, then each “tile” or “element” carrying geometrical and physical data may be mapped on to a\nfabrication unit manifesting such specific material properties and behavioral attributes.\nBoth methodological frameworks are mutually exclusive and may be experimented with independently\nof each other. In Chapter 7 we review a set of experiments each promoting one or both frameworks\nin different stages of the design process. These experiments culminate with the introduction of a new\ntechnology developed by the author and coined Variable Property Rapid Prototyping (Oxman 2009).\nVariable Property Rapid Prototyping (VPRP) is a novel technology which enables the controlled variation of material properties during the process of material deposition in a 3D printing application. This\ntechnology combines a novel software environment coined Variable Property Modeling (VPM) with a\nmechanical output tool designed as a 3D printer. VPRP allows for physical prototyping of graduated\nproperties in product design scale, based on the design and fabrication logic of Functionally Gradient\nMaterials (FGMs). Currently, there exists no rapid prototyping technology which allows for modifying\nmaterial properties such as strength, stiffness, density and elasticity as continuous gradients across the\nsurface and volume area of a functional component. Such variations are usually achieved as discrete\nchanges in physical behavior by printing multiple components with different properties and definite delineations between materials, and assembling them only after the fabrication process has been completed.\nSuch processes result in material waste and lack of functional precision. VPRP introduces the ability to\ndynamically mix, grade, and vary the ratios of different materials in order to produce a continuous gradient, highly optimized to fit its structural performance with an efficient use of materials, reduction of\nwaste and the production of a highly customizable features with added functionalities.\n6.3.7\n\nThe Variable Property Design Environment: Coupling Material Properties and Environmental Performance Requirements\n\nWhat if instead of designing with shapes, one would design with material properties? What if voxels\nalone could incorporate both material and environmental data and generate any 3D form as a function\nof its interaction with the environment and the parameters mapped between, and on top, of those two\ndomains. What if material would spatially distribute itself as a function of anticipated load coupled\nwith required light and thermal conditions? The field of Material-based Design Computation as a design\nparadigm requires that we rethink from the bottom-up both our design products and our processes as\ninformed by the environment.\nCan functional grading, informed by the coupling of internal material properties and external environmental constraints, be designed, not purely as a post-rationalization technique, but rather become an\nintegral part of the form-generation process? This is the basic question at the heart of the Variable\nProperty Design (VPD) Environment that was invented as one of the methodological platforms for the\ndevelopment of this new design approach/technology, its models, its tools and its applications.\n6.3.7.1\n\nIssues and Objectives\n\nThe main problem addressed by the VPD environment is how to generate unit-based information in\na CAD setting that promotes the generation of form? Imagine, for instance, the use of functionally\ngradient materials, the functional distribution of which are directly informed by the environment and\nsimultaneously fabricated via rapid prototyping technologies. Given their variation of properties across\nvolume and surface area, FGM’s could potentially be 3D printed by sending the machine a layer-by-layer\npixel sheet such that when they are stacked they are represented as voxel clouds (Hopkinson, Hague et al.\n2006). Functional grading, though, is something to be designed, and voxels, are merely representative of\n\n164 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nphysical data scanning. However, given their representation as discrete elements defining a continuous\nwhole, able to carry 3D information (scalars, vectors) as well as physical information (tensors), voxels\nare ideal entities to design and edit graded functionalities.\nVolumetric property design is new to CAD and CAM systems and offers an alternative to NURB and\nSTL representations. The diagram below exemplifies the need for a Variable Property Modeling (VPM)\nparadigm (Hopkinson, Hague et al. 2006).\nThe structure of a nerve’s dendrite, schematically represented in Figure 6.18, nicely illustrates the notion\nof variable properties in multiple domains: the outer layer of the dendrite is stiffer then its inner substance. Its inner substance displays variation in conductivity depending on the location of the electrical\nsignal. In other words, the nerve displays variation both across its longitudinal section (in the length dimension) and its transversal section (perpendicular to the length dimension). Such variation is incredibly\ndifficult and challenging to account for in any traditional 3D modeling software.\n6.3.7.2\n\nVPD Domains\n\nWithin the VPM modeling environment, the program must translate desired model properties to material\nproperties. The VPM environment gives the value of any property at any point (high or low conductivity\n/ stiff or soft) in order to structure the correct material composition and emulate both its structural and\nelectrical performance. Currently, transition functions that compute gradient property distribution across\none or multiple dimensions do not exist in CAD.\nThe VPM environment is developed in order to cater for such requirements and present physical data\nand material composition by treating voxels as tensors (geometrical entities containing multiple physical parameters), or by computing transitions between multiple compositional phases as extrapolation\nfunctions. Clearly, the distribution of materials must be limited by the boundary of the solid, or, its\ndomain.\nFreeform design has seen an abundance of software packages supporting complex modeling environments in terms of surface and solid descriptions through NURBS and/or mesh architectures. Predominantly, the challenge in design has been focused around the geometrical description of form as propertyless features to which material is assigned homogeneously in the process of fabrication. The VPM\nmodeling environment supports the representation of solids as geometrical features described by their\nmaterial composition. The distribution functions of properties across the domain are valid, but not exclusive, to that domain.\n6.3.7.3\n\nVPD Material Properties\n\nThe VPM environment distinguishes between two classes of properties: discrete properties and variable\nproperties. Discrete properties (DISC-props) are constant, and are assigned to areas of constant properties\nacross the surface, or volume, area of the domain. Being independent of each other, discrete properties\ncannot intersect. For instance, when relating to the extreme cases of strength, a voxel cannot be defined\nas soft and stiff at the same time. Variable (VAR-props) Properties are assigned for advanced property\ndistribution such as the one discussed in the example above. Variable properties describe areas with\ngradient material composition across the surface, or volume, area of a domain.\n6.3.7.4\n\nVPD Distribution Functions\n\nA distribution function will typically describe the value of a given property (i.e. strength, conductivity)\nas a function of location. The VPM environment distinguishes between absolute and relative distribution\nfunctions. An absolute distribution function is defined by a function and the distance to, or from, a given\n\nMethodological Frameworks 165\n\nproperty. The function computes the relation between the relative distance, given by the user, and the\nproperty fracture. For example, the material is X times softer in Y times the distance from the boundary\nof the model across its length. The relative distribution function is defined by two properties and a\nfunction. From any given point, the shortest distance is calculated to the maximum magnitude of both\nproperties.\nIn the example shown above, the domain contains the geometrical representation of the solid itself, its\nproperties include stiffness and conductivity, and its distribution functions compute the transition from\nstiff to soft regions and from highly-conductive to low-conductive regions within the domain.\nLike the example above, many other products and building components require a rethinking of their\nmodeling environment in order to achieve the ability to design and edit graded material compositions\nas the ones offered by Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs). The limited functionality with current\nCAD systems is due to conventional fabrication technologies which do not take graded properties into\naccount.\n6.3.8\n\nEco Voxels: Definitions\n\nThe technical approach facilitating Variable Property Design considers the digital voxel as a material\nproxy mediating between its pre-defined material properties and the environmental constraints included\nwithin one unique, or multiply negotiated, objective functions.\n6.3.8.1\n\nVoxel-Space\n\nA voxel, defined as occupying material space, can be extended to represent physical and tensor properties\nin a computational space. These local material properties physically and spatially interconnect component parts into a connected whole. The 3D space occupied by the proxy-voxels (with equal footing in\nboth digital and physical domains) is defined as the Voxel-Space. In addition to each voxel incorporating material and environmental data, it may also potentially contain data indicating its relative location\nwithin a “voxel cloud”. For example, suppose we are discussing the curvature-stress-color aspects of an\nobject, a voxel could occupy a position in curvature-stress-color space, but transmit information about\nits relative position in the object.\nThe motivating assumption here is that if a finite computational representation unit (e.g. pixel, voxel,\nmaxel) can potentially contain a multiplicity of physical data relating to various conditions (e.g. density,\ntransparency), than a design can be computationally generated that matches precisely its particular constraints for every given such representational unit. It then follows that, if this finite unit correlates in size\nand in space with the units applied to describe any performance data (e.g. structural, environmental), then\ndifferences required in material behavior are perfectly matched to difference portrayed in material properties. In other words, given that we can computationally represent constant and dynamic states of energy\n(e.g. force, heat) confined to specific boundary conditions, and given that we can theoretically negotiate\nand assign multiple physical properties to the materials and their micro-structures defining the design,\nthen the distribution in properties can potentially and precisely match the distribution in performance\nconstraints defined by the environment in the form-generation process. In this sense, form becomes the\nby-product of integrating material performance, environmental performance and fabrication data.\nAs a result, the size and property measure of a computational unit must correlate with:\n• The size and properties of the energy unit (e.g. Joules/other units of work)\n• The size and properties of the material unit (e.g. grain, cells, fibers)\n• The size and properties of the geometry unit (e.g. triangulated mesh)\n\n166 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\n• The size and properties of the fabrication unit (e.g. powder molecule)\n6.3.8.2\n\nObjective Functions Informing the Voxel Properties\n\nAs recalled, an objective function is a mathematical function associated with an optimization problem\nwhich determines how good, or fitting, a solution is. In the simplest cases, this requires solving problems\nin which one seeks to minimize, or maximize, a real function by systematically choosing the values of\nreal, or integer, variables from within a given set. This formulation, using a scalar, real-valued objective\nfunction, is probably the simplest example; the generalization of optimization theory and techniques to\nother formulations comprises a large area of applied mathematics. More generally, it means finding “best\navailable” values of some objective function given a defined domain, including a variety of different types\nof objective functions and different types of domains (Atallah, Fox et al. 1999).\nThe process of adding more than one objective to an optimization problem adds complexity and also\nrequires strategies for negotiation. For example, in order to optimize a structural design, the designer\nwould seek a design that is both light and rigid. Given that these two objectives may conflict, a negotiation strategy must apply. Within the scope of possible designs to satisfy the solution space there will be\none lightest design, one stiffest design, and an infinite number of designs that are some compromise of\nweight and stiffness. This set of trade-off designs is known as a Pareto set, and the curve created plotting\nweight against stiffness of the best designs is known as the Pareto Frontier (Das and Dennis 1997). A\ndesign is judged to be Pareto optimal, if it is not dominated by other designs: a Pareto optimal design\nmust be better than another design in at least one aspect. If it is worse than another design in all respects,\nthen it is considered dominated and is not Pareto optimal.\n6.3.8.3\n\nPareto Optimal Voxels (POV)\n\nPareto Optimal Voxels (POV’s) as formulated by the author are three-dimensional computational units\nthat incorporate more than one performance constraint, and do so in a continuous non-discrete, nonbinary manner. In other words, we seek to define a POV as (1) a unit which can contain data of various\nkinds, such as structural load requirements and acoustical requirements, both incorporated into the computational description of the unit, and, (2) a unit the description of which per any given performance\ncriteria (e.g. structural and/or environmental) can be expressed in non-binary, non-discrete, but continuous terms. For example, when considering transparency characteristics, the designer would be able to\nassign such visual parameters from an entire set of options ranging from opaque state to transparent state\nwith various translucency states in between.\n6.3.8.4\n\nProperty Definitions of Material Voxels\n\nMaterial-voxel properties are defined as the intermediary media between environmental impetus and\nmaterial response. (i.e., force is an environmental impetus, extension is a material response, and stiffness\nis the material property that mediates the two). Granted, we are considering wider sets of couplings\nbetween environment and response, and these are reflected in the complexity of the material.\nFor example, the representational unit would contain material properties. Given an environment, the\nmaterial response would be computed through the material properties, the representational unit’s connectivity, and its geometry. It is important to note that the consideration of material property distribution\nas it is informed by the environment is generic in the sense that environmental constraints are collected\nover time and responded to within a static object that is, at least for now, devoid of any dynamic capabilities. Clearly, the environment is dynamic and not predictable. In other words, the design, which is based\n\nMethodological Frameworks 167\n\non the negotiation between environment and the optimal response, could be considered dynamic—but\nthe construction of the artifact is static: it happens only once.\n6.3.8.5\n\nHierarchies of Material Voxels\n\nIt is important to note the potential of considering such computational units as hierarchical, instead of\nmerely correlating the size and property measures. In this research, such hierarchies are considered\nmainly during the process of modeling, where groups of voxels are hierarchically organized as a function of their performance and material attributes. However, one could imagine that the designer can\nhave control over the design by distinguishing between larger voxels that keep track of environmental\nresponses that are “roughly homogeneous” on a larger scale. These responses could potentially be composed of sub-voxels that do the same job at a smaller scale. The sub-voxels then would communicate\nwith their voxels which would communicate with the other voxels within the domain. This hierarchy\ncould be extended to as small a unit as is defined by the type and magnitude of performances addressed\nin the environment.\n6.3.8.6\n\nUnit Definitions of Material Voxels\n\nWe distinguish between three types of units:\n1. Energy unit: This unit is derived and defined by the environmental field or impetus (e.g. temperature, electric field, illumination, and so on). These elements should also scale with the gradient of\nthese variables (i.e., if illumination is changing rapidly, then the computational unit must be small\nenough to capture the gradient).\n2. Material Unit: The material units are defined by both the material properties (i.e. stiffness, density,\ntransparency and so on), and by the micro-structural organization of multiple units (i.e. grains,\nfibers etc).\n3. Geometry Unit: this unit is defined by its shape (i.e. triangle, tetrahedron, etc) and by the connectivity established between two or more units (i.e. triangles that are part of some tetrahedron,\ntetrahedral that share the same triangle, etc).\n6.3.9\n\nEco Maxels: Types\n\nThe desired integration between processes of modeling, analysis and fabrication and their related representational platform assumes that units of energy may be equivalent in form and dimension to the units\nof physical matter as they are discharged from a fabrication machine for rapid manufacturing. This condition carries implications that are profound for products and processes of design alike as it promotes\nthe unification between constraints, properties and emergent form. In other words, the integration and\nparametric homogenization between units of work (energy) and unit of matter (form) has the potential to\nyield new forms of design space where design “units” can denote a combination of factors relating to the\ninteraction between matter and energy in the production of form.\nBelow I have identified several such couplings between energy and Material Voxels (Maxels) that have\nserved this thesis in the experimentation with classes of emergent material organization. It goes without\nsaying that the parametric negotiation and calibration between these types has proved to be a significant,\nand possibly unresolved, challenge to be experimented with as part of the design process depicted in the\nfollowing chapter.\n\n168 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nNote that each voxel/maxel type is, in fact, a tensor including geometrical parameters indicating it size\nand location in space, material parameters indicating physical properties relevant to its behavior, and\nenvironmental parameters indicative of the type of environmental forces, and any of their combinations,\ngoverning the design.\n6.3.9.1\n\nPressure Maxels (Load) - Designing with Structural Parameters\n\nLoad induced growth, as one of the relevant factors that shape trees, bones and other natural specimens,\nboth in the process of growth as well as during maturity, is a process informed by the interaction of the\nmaterial on the one hand (wood, bone, etc), and the environmental pressure (load) on the other. Rather\nthan distinguishing between the two, pressure maxels are conceptualized here as material units shaped\nand informed by various degrees of pressure (not unlike processes of pressure treatment for wood, or\nload induced growth in a broken leg) given some initial shape.\nPressure maxels6.7 are therefore directly related to any anticipated loading data (Figure 6.19). For each\ndesign object, whether pre, or post, its generation, a structural analysis package is typically used to\nestablish the distribution of load and potential displacements under vertical, lateral, or any combination\nof loads. The distribution of anticipated load as a function of specific and relatively constant loading\nconditions is then mapped to material properties which are, in turn, assigned to the shape (in the case\nof material-based tessellation) or combined together to form the shape (in the case of material-based\nform-generation).\nA series of fabrication materials ranging in properties from rigid to flexible were used to counteract\nanticipated local loading conditions previously defined as part of the design context. The parameters that\nwere considered in the description of the fabrication materials included tensile strength, elongation to\nbreak, tensile tear resistance, and shore hardness of various types. The exact data for each parameter is\ngiven in relation to each experiment and defined per its context.\nThe main aim is to implement a range of properties to account for anticipated structural load, as opposed\nto the more typical case of distinguishing between hard and soft materials implemented as separate\nstructural components, as is the case in the application of steel and glass as the respective structural and\nenvironmental components of building.\n6.3.9.2\n\nThermal Maxels (Heat) - Designing with Environmental Parameters\n\nHeat flux or thermal flux, also referred to as heat flux density or heat flow rate intensity, is defined as\nW\nthe flow of energy per unit of area per unit of time. In SI units, it is measured in m\n2 . Given that this\ndimension occupies both a direction and a magnitude, it is considered a vectorial quantity. In order to\ndetermine the magnitude and direction of a thermal voxel in the digital domain which occupies the design\nspace, we assume the limiting case where the size of the surface or volume element making up the design\nobject is infinitesimally small.\nHeat flux is often denoted φq , the subscript q specifying heat flux, as opposed to mass or momentum flux\n(Figure 6.20).\nHeat flux measurement is often achieved by measuring a temperature gradient over a stock of material\nwith known thermal conductivity. This method is analogous to a standard way to measure an electric\ncurrent, where one measures the voltage drop over a known resistor.\nThe implications of design processes informed by the energy balance of which heat flux plays a crucial\nrole are enormous. Rather than adding ACAV systems to a façade, building materials have now the\ncapacity to sustain, and potentially control, internal heat distribution relative to environmental needs. In\n6.7\n\nAlso conceptually understood as “stress maxels”\n\nMethodological Frameworks 169\n\nthis respect, the concept of heat-maxels material units the properties of which are informed by temperature parameters may indeed promote an integrated approach to form generation driven by environmental\nanalysis and simulation.\n6.3.9.3\n\nLight Maxels (Light) - Designing with Phenomenological/Visual Parameters\n\nBeyond the practical architectural requirements for the quantity of daylight relative to the size and location of a space, the qualities of natural light and its distribution within the space have great visual and\neven sensorial implications on the inhabitant (Figure 6.21). Unlike the family of engineering parameters,\narchitectural parameters are at times associated with phenomenological criteria which are not always\nquantifiable.\nLight can be measured and used in many different ways. Amongst the many quantities of light, one may\ninclude luminous energy (whose units are Qv and SI units are lumen seconds), luminous flux (whose\nunits are F and SI units are lumen), luminous intensity (whose units are Iv and SI units are candela),\nluminance (whose units are Lv and SI units are candela per square meter), illuminance (whose units are\nEv and SI units are lux), luminance emittance (whose units are Mv and SI units are lux), and luminous\nefficacy (whose units are Mv and SI units are lumens per watt).\nMotivated by the ambition to explore multiple qualities of light and their effect on the environment\nboth from an energy and a comfort perspective light maxels are defined as material units the properties\nof which are directly informed and associated with qualities of visual value. The dominant material\nproperties explored and implemented are related to the opacity or transparency of the material unit, and\nthe various levels of translucency in between.\n6.3.9.4\n\nComfort Maxels (Physiological Pain) - Designing with Physiological Parameters\n\nSimilarly to the mapping of load, heat and light, the designer might also engage the mapping of other\nparameters such as physical comfort (when occupying a furniture piece, or leaning against a soft wall),\nor, alternatively, physical pain, when attempting to treat a medical condition. However, unlike the parameterization of load, heat and light, pain-mapping appears to be significantly more challenging with\nregards to its evaluation, analysis and prediction (Figure 6.22).\nDefined as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue\ndamage, or described in terms of such damage”6.8 , numerous theories are associated with the quantification of the sensory and affective sensations of pain; and it is this process of quantification that is required\nfor the establishment of material shape and distribution in the design of a product or a building part.\nComfort maxels could be thought of as mechanical stress associated with physical pain or relief. Material units are applied to counteract any physical sensation of discomfort or pressure. “Pain”, in this\ncontext, provides for the environmental constraints coupled with the material properties associated with\nthe maxel. Indeed, one of the main challenges still remains as in the other cases the sizing and shaping\nof each of these components relative to the mapping of mechanical discomfort. More regarding this is\npresented in the description of the experiments in the following chapter.\n\n6.8\n\nThis often quoted definition was first formulated by an IASP Subcommittee on Taxonomy: Bonica, JJ (1979). Pain 6 (3):\n247252. ISSN 0304-3959.PMID 460931.

Its\nmain objective has been to act as an intermediary link between the issues and questions raised in the\nprevious chapter, and the design experiments testing the research assumptions, in the following chapter.\nThe method frameworks were presented as the various methods applied (and frequently, invented) in the\nresearch; furthermore, they have offered an experimental and organizational structure according to which\nto interpret and to further extrapolate the experimental results within a larger design context.\nSet with the theoretical task of introducing the methodological foundations of natural design and the\ntechnical foundations for Material-based Design Computation, this chapter has focused on the two major\nissues that the author has found to be central to establishing these foundations. The main goal was to\ndefine a set of design methods that would support the generation of multi-functional objects, including\nbuildings, as well as to enable the integration of analytical routines with synthetic ones in the overall\nproduction of form.\nOrganized by order of complexity and specificity, the method-frameworks include both conceptual and\ntechnical depictions of tools and technologies employed to both generate and analyze the design experiments introduced in the following chapter.\nConceptual frameworks are driven by theory, whereas technical frameworks are driven by technological appropriations. The main ideas focus on the notion of Variable Property Design a process which\npromotes the distribution of material properties as it is directly informed by the environment. Digital\nanisotropy, in its various classes, has been presented as a mechanism by which to achieve physical distribution in the digital realm. In order to implement such force-driven shaping or distribution of material,\na material unit must be defined that incorporates both physical properties and environmental constraints.\nFibers and grains were introduced as classes of material organization. Following this, several processes\nhave been presented, each characterized by its scale and contribution to the structuring of form, that\npromote Material-based Design Computation from a modeling perspective (Tiling Behavior), an analysis perspective (Finite Synthesis Method) and a fabrication technology perspective (Variable Property\nFabrication). Finally, an inclusive computational environment has been developed which supports the\nintegration of these three platforms into one in which a modeling, analysis and fabrication milieu has\nbeen invented that operates in processes not unlike nature’s way. This computational environment points\ntowards the calibration of material and environment units as homologous in terms of their formal representation. In this way (and, assuming that we are currently investigating only additive fabrication\nmethods) physical material fabrication units are identical to analysis mesh elements which are, in turn,\nindistinguishable from cellular, or tessellated modeling units. These units are termed Eco-Pixels and they\nare unique in that they combine geometrical, performative (structural or environmental) and manufacturing data within one singular unit. Units are assembled into a tissue-like form and further into solids via\nthe same mechanisms, further discussed and experimentally developed in the following chapter. We have\nfocused on mainly four classes of eco- material-pixels (maxels) as we address different types of data and\ncombinations of such data. They include Pressure Maxels (relating or of relation to structural parameters), Thermal Maxels (relating or of relation to environmental parameters), Light Maxels (relating or of\nrelation to visual parameters) and Comfort Maxels (relating or of relation to physiological parameters).\nThe following chapter in which the experiments are described is structured according to the organization\nof theoretical and technical concepts offered by the methodological frameworks.\nVariable Property Design of materials with heterogeneous properties across a wide array of scales and\napplications holds a profound place in the future of design and engineering. The ability to synthetically\nengineer and fabricate such materials using VPD strategies appears to be incredibly promising as it in-\n\nSummary: From Experimental Material-based Methods to Experimental Design Computation 171\n\ncreases the product’s structural and environmental performance, enhances material efficiency, promotes\nmaterial economy and optimizes material distribution. Among other contributions, Material-based Design Computation promotes a design approach through digital fabrication of heterogeneous materials\ncustomized to fit their structural and environmental functions.\nTo offer a more theoretical, perhaps futuristic, summary, assuming that the environment of an artifact can\nbe perfectly mapped and defined with sufficient material information, then the environmental response\nof the artifact could be computed with arbitrary accuracy. If a metric for the quality of a particular\nresponse is defined, and the set of all possible designs and material choices could be enumerated, then it\nis possible to select, or better yet, generate an optimal design. If this is the case, then the environment\nand the response metric would uniquely determine the optimal design; because the design is computed,\nso would be the means to create the artifact. The practice of architecture is at last reawakening to its new\nrole as (a) second nature.\n\n172 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nFigure 6.1: Distribution-driven digital anisotropy considers the allocation\nof pixels as analogous to that of homogeneous physical matter. In this case,\nevery pixel contains equal properties (represented by the color red), however,\nthe heterogeneous organization of pixel-groups on a larger scale, defines its\noverall performance, depending on the property at hand. In this case, the\ncube is heterogeneously structured due to the non-homogeneous distribution\nof “pixel units”.\n\nFigures 173\n\nFigure 6.2: Property-driven digital anisotropy considers the allocation of pixels as analogous to that of heterogeneous physical matter. In this case, every\npixel contains specific properties represented by different colors. For example, darker colors may represent stiff opaque units, while lighter colors\nmay represent transparent soft units, corresponding to a particular loading\nscenario coupled with a desired visual spatial performance.\n\n174 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nFigure 6.3: Property-distribution driven digital anisotropy illustrates a composite scenario made up of the two previous examples. In this case, empty\nspaces within the cube may be defined by distribution anisotropy, while\nproperty-variation represented by color may be defined by property distribution.\n\nFigures 175\n\nFigure 6.4: “Grains” are defined as symmetrical isotropic cells. In this image,\nall “material units” are defined as spheres of equal volume contributing to the\noverall isotropic nature of each unit. Anisotropic behavior is defined by the\nheterogeneous distribution of spherical units.\n\nFigure 6.5: “Fibers” are defined as anisotropic cells. In this image, all “material units” are defined as ellipses defining the overall trajectory and orientation of the global tissue-like structure. Anisotropic behavior in this case is\ndefined by both the orientation of an individual “material unit” as well as the\noverall organization of all units.\n\n176 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nFigure 6.6: Tilings with translational symmetry in the Alhambra palace in\nGranada, Spain.

Experimentation into digital from-finding computation supported by FEM and particle analysis. The 3-D curvature of the surface presented is induced by the\napplication of resin in 2-D followed by stress release. The initial form is 2-dimentiional (elastic membrane + resin\nimpregnation) and curves in 3 dimensions upon the relase of the stretch. Residual energy is released to generate\nthe 3-D form. This process is then computed for various types of 2-D resin impregnations resulting in various 3-D\ncurvature types.\n\nFigure 6.9: Shrink-warp, 2007, Material-data fields (Oxman and Rosenberg 2007).

Rather than treating surface tessellation merely as a post-rationalization algorithm for the generation of developable surfaces (i.e. tiles that are constructible), tiling behavior calls\nfor the inclusion of material properties in the tessellation process.

The method was developed with the aim of regenerating accurate 3-D replicas of a given object\nby projecting multiple prints of different angles and carving them relative to\nthe reference artifact. Photo sculpting employs 2-D projections to regenerate\n3-D objects; “Material pixels” may potentially employ 2-D planes as they are\ninformed by light to generate 3-D form.\n\nFigure 6.22: Pain is challenging to define and to quantify. Moreover, universal solutions are typically insufficient as each patient’s profile is different.\nPain can be individually mapped using ultrasound devices that may potentially inform the design of a restorative device such as an orthopedic shoe or\na splint.

Typing, piano-playing\nand rock-climbing are but a few of the patient’s desired activities which she is ardent to pursue. Her\nphysiological demands are quite challenging to sustain under conditions of repetitive stress trauma.\nA preliminary online search turns up the optimal solution: a medical carpal tunnel splint designed for\nvarious types of hand orthosis. The splint is known to effectively limit wrist flexion and extension during\nrepetitive hand motion as it assists in helping heal the effects of carpal tunnel syndrome. It is typically\nmade up of two hard and soft components, combined such that the removable aluminum splint can easily\nbe inserted into a soft fabric glove. Available in three sizes, it is comprised of a dual layer of cotton\nstretch Lycra to increase comfort and improve circulation.\nHowever, problems reported online generally relate to the glove’s generic form and, as a result, its inability to match the patient’s particular “pain profile”. In addition, a different kind of glove, made of\ndifferent types of materials, is required for the various activities. The ordinary glove therefore lacks\nmulti-functionality as well as any potential for customization.\n7.1\nLetter to Sir Joseph Hooker (11 Jan 1844). In Charles Darwin and Francis Darwin (ed.), Charles Darwin: His Life Told in\nan Autobiographical Chapter, and in a Selected Series of His Published Letters (1892), 173-174.\n\n190 NATURAL ARTIFICE\n\nCarpal Skin (Oxman, 2010, Boston Museum of Science) was designed to resolve and better assist the\npatient in customizing the glove to her wrist so as to fit the patient’s anatomical and physiological needs\nacross various types of activities (Figure 7.1).\nHere is how Carpal Skin is made: bending sensors are attached to the patient’s hands and wrists. Movement control is measured and evaluated according to the relative magnitude and duration of pain, qualified by the patient as an aching sensation measured in intervals between 1 and 10. Each interval is\nmapped to a material stiffness parameter ranging between very stiff and very soft. A software package\naverages the data such that stiff and soft materials are distributed in order to restrain particular movements\nexecuted during particular activities. Various degrees of stiffness are mapped to their respective various\ndegrees of qualified pain levels. This information is then mapped on top of a 3D surface representation\nof the patient’s hand and wrist previously 3D scanned into the computer.\nThe glove is finally 3D printed as one continuous object using a Variable Property 3D Printer (Oxman\n2009) which modifies the glove’s material properties as well as its thickness on the fly as it emits photopolymer material of varying elastic modulus.\nAttached to the outer shell of the glove is a “breathable” foam liner wicking away moisture from the skin.\nThe lightweight material offers the patient’s wrist support while maintaining a high level of comfort. A\nthermoplastic outer shell can be heat-molded to fit the user’s individual needs.\n7.1.2\n\nWhy is Carpal Skin Unique?\n\nCarpal Skin, which will later be described in further technical detail, is but a single case demonstrating\na design process that is intrinsically coupled with the set of constraints and performances established as\nthe drivers for its design. One may claim that this is true of any engineering problem. However, this\nprocess differs in several ways:\n7.1.2.1\n\nForm-finding\n\nThe texture and material distribution (both of which are informed by the required distribution of stiffness)\nof the glove are not determined a-priori, as they would have been, given a typical design process. It is\nrather the outcome of matching performance constraints to corresponding material properties.\n7.1.2.2\n\nCustomizability\n\nGiven such a form-finding process, a highly customized product one unlike any other - is formed. In\nother words, Carpal Skin allows for the generation of a singular holistic process which can potentially be\napplied to different cases. For each patient, with his own special anatomical and physiological requirements, the process (and, as a result, the product itself) is customized.\n7.1.2.3\n\nMulti-functionality\n\nThe glove morphology is determined by negotiating several requirements such as the need for assigning\nstiff and soft regions in high proximity to correspond with movement control and comfort respectively7.2 .\n\n7.2\nIt is important to note that the mapping between pain and stiffness levels was qualified and reduced to several levels defined\nby the designer. This mapping process requires further mathematical reformulation.\n\nIntroduction: A Journey into Natural Design 191\n\n7.1.2.4\n\nMaterial Property Continuity (Continuity versus Componentizations)\n\nTraditionally, design products are fabricated by assembling multiple parts with their discrete mechanical\nproperties. In this case, an integrated continuous tissue-like morphology is developed and its properties\ndifferentiated. Material properties and behavior are directly associated with specific pathological and\nphysiological conditions.\n7.1.2.5\n\nProcess Integration\n\nContrary to the typical design process, where design representation from conception to fabrication is\nguided by stream-lining generative and analytical routines, we have proposed and demonstrated an integrated process where analysis procedures define a “material space” in which to generate the form and\nby which to map environmental requirements to physical properties. We begin by mapping performance\ncriteria to material properties, which, in turn, directly inform the rate and volume of mixtures of materials\nas they are deposited to form the glove object surface.\n7.2\n\nBasic Assumptions of the Experiments\n\nCarpal Skin is representative of the type of design objectives sought after in the context of Natural Design. Each experiment represents a different kind of investigation into both the theoretical and technical\nfoundations of the thesis. A few significant issues must however be clarified, before describing the\nexperiments and related findings.\n7.2.1\n\nGeneration vs. Mutation\n\nOne of the most significant inquiries central to this thesis relates to the definitions and related processes\nfor the origin of (artificial) form. What is the origin of form? How do we invent form? How do we\ngenerate it? On what basis do we begin?\nIn the research we have attempted to define a set of issues and questions developed in the fifth chapter, which were then coupled with methodologies and technologies devised to address those issues and\nresearch questions as developed in the previous chapter. Each of these issues, however (i.e. multifunctionality, process-integration, etc.), could be explored and tested in different stages of the design\nprocess. In other words, one can explore the extent to which the theoretical and technical foundations\nof Natural Design and Material-based Design Computation are applied to a form generation process beginning with no form and ending with full construction of the generated design. Conversely, one might\nalso apply these ideas within an intermediate phase of an on-going design, after certain initial formal\nassumptions have been made. For example, the form of a chair might be “designed from scratch” including both overall shape and material both the result of mapping and negotiating between different criteria\nat different stages as directed by the designer. However, the overall form of that same chair may have\nwell been pre-conceived applying other values, assumptions and processes, while other aspects such as\nmaterial and texture may be designed subsequently by a completely different process7.3 .\nIn the context of this chapter, experiments are presented demonstrating both of these basic design processes. The first is total integrated design without prior ideation, the second, a form of design in which\nthere is a prior condition related to overall form, or typology. In the experiments we have explored the\npotential of material guided form-generation processes in both of these conditions. At times, the experiments are set as complete cohesive explorations with no a priori formal ideation decisions such as that of\n7.3\n\nThis is particularly true of design projects that begin with certain conditions given or requested by the client or the curator.\n\n192 NATURAL ARTIFICE\n\noverall form in the design of a chair. In the first case, such experiments include only an initial mapping\nof relevant environmental conditions as well as functional requirements to be satisfied are defined as\ninputs of the design process. In certain of the experiments, these contextual/functional parameters are\nexpanded by various options for the type of material properties and organization are experimented with\ndue to their potential implications for the application of material-based design computation to performance conditions of sustainable design. In the second case, there already exists some high-level a priori\ndesign decision such as overall form. We may refer to the first case as form generation (morphogenesis);\nwhile the second case may be termed form mutation, or form refinement.7.4\nIn order to clarify such a distinction between processes that explore the generation of form and processes\nexploring the mutation of form, we have indicated for each experiment what assumptions were made.\nThe overall objectives have been to test the theoretical assumptions and methodological/technological\ninventions of Material-based Design Computation in a range of these two generic conditions of design.\nIn all experiments we have also given priority to the testing of Material-based Design Computation to\nfunction as a medium of Natural Design, that is, to produce design solutions with implicit ecological\npotential, e.g. multi-functional performance, gradated materiality, etc.\n7.2.2\n\nStatic vs. Dynamic Objects\n\nThe experiments focus of processes of design and fabrication which are informed by structural and\nenvironmental performance parameters. Of great significance in considering the following experiments\nas validating the thesis’ research questions and theoretical, methodological and technological inventions\nis the distinction between static and dynamic objects and processes. The research described in this thesis\nfocuses on performance-driven form-generation of static objects. Real-time performance mappings (i.e.\ncharting the solar trajectory, etc.) as might be applied to dynamic and responsive objects are not here\nconsidered (more about this later as we contemplate future directions).\nDynamics (material response in real time) is, in a sense, the natural relaxation of the boundaries of the\nscope that this research attempts cover. However, I consider the methods and technologies invented\nas having important relevance and implications for the development dynamic responsive design. It is\ncertainly a technical step, but not at all a conceptual one, to imagine the dynamic local control which\noptimizes the designs demonstrated here being implemented as actuators in a physical artifact that is also\ndynamic. I will address this in my conclusions regarding the general implications and fields of influence\nof Material-based Design Computation.\n7.2.3\n\nProcess vs. Product Experimentation\n\nThe experiments presented here may be classified into product and process-oriented experiments exploring issues, topics and questions from shared perspectives of design and production, and, indeed, from\nthe perspective of potentially identifying them as mutually inclusive. Ultimately, as in nature, processes\nof design fabrication and manufacturing may potentially take place simultaneously with processes of\nform-generation. To again employ the case of the human bone: the bone’s form is the result of dynamic\nanalysis paralleled with integrated fabrication (or rather, formation) processes.\nDespite this vision of integrated form generation and formation/fabrication and its significant potential\nimplications for the future of design, most of the experiments relate to the research issues of Materialbased Design Computation as a form generation medium. Further experiments relate to Material-based\nDesign Computation as a medium that is integral with, and influential upon, enhanced attributes of\n7.4\nIt is at times challenging to decipher between the two, as various manipulations of any existing form may result in its\ntopological reformulation\n\nBasic Assumptions of the Experiments 193\n\nfabrication such as muti-functional performance. The focus within which each experiment has been\nundertaken (form-generation versus fabrication) made clear to the reader.\n7.2.4\n\nEngineering vs. Architectural Performance\n\nThe dichotomy between engineering and architectural performance is particularly relevant when considering the drivers of form. The two disciplines represent value systems which are at times conflicting;\nhence, some clarification regarding selection and definition of performance factors is required. From\nan engineering perspective, it is fundamental that a building remains stable. From an architectural perspective achieving optimal visual and thermal comfort may be equally important. Clearly, a hierarchy\nnaturally emerges that defines the importance of loading requirements over, for instance, effects created\nwhen light hits the building’s skin. It is to be noted, that for most experiments performance criteria\nincluding physical performance attributes, such as structural, thermal, and acoustic requirements have\nbeen the main bases of the research.\n7.2.5\n\nComputational Form-Finding vs. Computational Form-Making\n\nProcesses of form-making are diametrically opposed to processes of form-finding. As previously discussed and demonstrated in Chapter 4, the almost ubiquitous presence of computational tools in the\ndesign disciplines has cultivated and promoted a certain culture of making whereby all that is modeled,\nis buildable. That may be the case, but not without paying a serious price in material redundancy and\nwaste.\nForm-finding protocols seek instead to instigate design processes in a way as natural as can be relative\nto the design problem and the materials at hand. We have previously discussed to physical form-finding\ntechniques promoted during the 1970’s in Europe by Frei Otto and his research institute, the ILS. In the\nfollowing experiments we present a similar approach in the the digital domain that may be considered,\ncomputational form-finding. This approach values material behavior and performance over geometric\nform generation. In those experiments in form-generation, form is generated in direct response to force.\nThe main idea behind each of the experiments demonstrated below is to consider the integration between\nenvironmental performance requirements, material choice and the propagation of form as a by-product\nof this unification.\n7.3\n\nThe Form of the Immaterial: Introduction to the Experiments\n\nWhen contemplating the form of the environment, one’s rationale rarely contemplates the immaterial.\nWe tend to note what is physically laid before our eyes as we ponder its origin. Look around you\nand you will find that any natural or man-made object occupying your visual landscape is actually an\nuncanny amalgamation of forces, materials, and processes that culminate in the form of things soap\nbubbles, chairs, trees, shells, huts, cones, skyscrapers, lampshades and so on. No problem of form is as\nconsequential to architecture and design as the one posed by translation from conception to production.\nIn the course of finding form, many factors are at work negotiating the space of formation, as complex\nand compound as it may be. Granted, nature has for millennia devised her own computations for the\ngeneration of form, not the least of which is the marvel of the genetic code and its contribution to growth.\nWhat is the physical process by which form is generated? To examine this, we have by now understood\nnature’s way and the many implications of design as the science of the artificial. How then can we\nachieve the science of the artificial computationally and in consideration of materiality? In such a universe of synthetic creation, under persistent threats of environmental implications, “finding form” merely\n\n194 NATURAL ARTIFICE\n\nfor form’s sake is simply not enough. In the experiments, computational form-finding methods have been\ndeveloped that support the integration of material properties under environmental constraints. This potentially achieves a synthesis between the theory, methods and technologies of Material Computing and\nthe inherent ecological values of natural design.\nEach project is, in effect, an exploration into the nature of finding form within a given context process\nor product driven, as it corresponds to a plethora of conditions and restraints defined by the designer and\nher vision. These explorations are consistent with the ambition to computationally form-find the shape\nof a product, a building element, or a more abstract object through the various methods by which it has\ncome into the world is of relevance to our contemporary discourse.\nAs we examine the form of load, heat, light, comfort, and pain to name those parametric pixilated\nenvironments which I have classified in the previous chapter we discover the richness and complexity\nof conditions achievable by our tools; we arrive, once again to a novel kind of practice where processformation is as equally, or more, significant than the formation of products or buildings (Figure 7.2).\nThe designer frequently exists in conditions guided by processes of conflicting nature: a surface must\nbe composed of a structurally robust, yet transparent, material, or a chair that requires the negotiation\nbetween softness and rigidity, etc. The Modernist tradition, as we have seen, has handled such functional\nnegotiations by discretely assigning materials and building systems to pre-determined functions. Structural components and functional partitioning remain to this day as symptomatic of modern design. The\nfollowing experiments aim at introducing a shift in discourse and method from mono-functional design\npromoting homogeneous material distributions, to multi-functional and highly customizable products\nsupported by integrated procedural routines.\nThe experiments are classified according to the system of classification offered in the previous chapter.\nEach experiment is a specifically designed study of the effects of form-generation as the result of a\ncluster of diverse environmental factors as the design drivers in Material-based Design Computational\nform-finding.\n7.4\n\nExperiments in Material-based Design Computation\n\nThe following section provides an overview of the experiments that were conducted in the development and testing of the models, methods and technologies of Material-based Design Computation. The\npurpose was to test, evaluate and further refine these developments. The experiments are organized according to the physical condition factors which were employed as input in order to generate material\nform as a function of physical input. In the following section further detailed descriptions of selected\nexperiments is provided.\nThe majority of these experiments may be considered process oriented. Process-oriented experiments\nare aimed at testing the models, methods and techniques that have been developed for supporting computational form generation routines. The process by which the design has emerged is the most significant\naspect of this group of experiments. Each such process holds some implications for the family of particular parametric constraints and their association with material properties in the derivation of form.\n7.4.1\n7.4.1.1\n\nThe Form of Load: Load Generated Material Systems\nVision: Artificial Bone\n\nImagine an aquarium-like container filled with calcified matter. Imagine that this sand-like material can\nsimply remain or fade away from its container depending on the stress level introduced to it. Loads,\nin the form of local weights, or, more precisely, the boundary conditions defining the perimeter of this\n\nExperiments in Material-based Design Computation 195\n\nsand-tank as it rests on a flat plane, are set up in various locations and in a range of magnitudes and\ndirections. The sandy grains then reorganize themselves as the matter precisely maps its distribution to\nthe orientation and magnitude of the load. Unloaded regions wither away as a cellular structure emerges\nas an accurate representation of the loads that have brought it about.\nThere is much structural redundancy in the construction industry. This is frequently attributed to local\nbuilding codes. However, in many cases such redundancy is merely the result of an architectural expression dominating the logic of the engineer. The structural engineer is generally guided by the spirit of\nmaterial minimalism to guarantee that material waste is avoided and efficiency is maximized. Can such\nforce-driven form-generation processes become computationally supported not as post-rationalization\nmechanisms implemented via analysis and simulation, but rather, can they contribute directly to the\nemergence of form, not unlike our vision for the formation of artificial bone?\n7.4.1.2\n\nLoad Generating Material Systems: Monocoque\n\nMuseum of Modern Art, Permanent Collection, 2008\nThe experiment was designed as a process supporting structural shell generation via computational formfinding. It is important to note that in this case, unlike other experiments presented here, the process of\nformal generation was applied atop an existing shell structure as an a priori input in the design process such that the form-generation process was limited to the texture generation and any geometrical\nand topological manipulations that followed. This condition is very similar in nature to the tessellation\nalgorithms discussed in the previous chapter.\nMonocoque (French for “single shell”) stands for a construction technique that supports structural load\nusing an object’s external skin; it represents an alternative approach to the fabrication of a skin-like\nmembrane. Traditionally, building skins are comprised of internal structural frameworks and non-bearing\nexternal elements. In this class of structures, the internal and external skins are integrated into one\ncontinuous surface. The density of this “structural skin” corresponds to a given set of hypothetical\nmulti-scalar loading conditions. The entire weight of Monocoque is supported by its skin, with thicker\nareas reminiscent of natural vascular structures bearing most of the load, while no internal supports are\nrequired.\nAs a result, this process promotes the heterogeneity and strategic distribution of material properties. The\nprocess of such material-based tessellation is governed here by the computation of a Voronoi pattern,\nthe density of which can potentially correspond to multiple loading conditions of various directions and\nmagnitudes. The distribution of shear-stress lines and surface pressure is embodied in the allocation and\nrelative thickness of the vein-like elements built into the skin.\nThe physical prototype represents a strategy for the design and fabrication of single shell structures. The\ncomponent was 3-D printed using the Polyjet Matrix Technology that simultaneously assigns a range\nof structural properties to multiple parts of an object and “prints” it out of multiple materials within a\nsingle build. This technology creates composite materials that physically represent preset combinations\nof mechanical properties (Figures 7.3-7.7).\n7.4.1.3\n\nLoad Generating Material Systems: Cartesian Wax\n\nMuseum of Modern Art, Permanent Collection, 2008\nIn this exploration, made of hard and soft, opaque and translucent, wax composites, I have attempted\nto experiment with material distribution within a material skin. Imagine for a moment, that instead of\nassigning hard-opaque and brittle-transparent materials for their respective functions (i.e. concrete and\nsteel to support the structural elements of a building-skin, and glass to provide for the environmental ele-\n\n196 NATURAL ARTIFICE\n\nments of the building-skin allowing visual and thermal flow), it might be possible to vary their properties\nsmoothly, and depending on the exact function required for a precise location within the building. In\nthis way, the designer could assume maximal control over the distribution of properties relative to their\nanticipated functions. One can only contemplate the extent to which material waste due to structural\nredundancy and modularity and componentizing could be minimized.\nCartesian Wax experimented with the possibility of applying such method. Here, a continuous tiling\nsystem was differentiated across its entire surface area to accommodate for a range of potential physical\nconditions such as light transmission, heat flux, and structural support. The surface is thickened locally\nwhere it is structurally required to support itself, and modulates its transparency according to the light\nconditions required, or desired. 20 tiles were assembled as a continuum comprised of multiple resin\ntypes from rigid to flexible, from opaque, through translucent to transparent. Each tile is designed as a\nstructural composite representing the local performance criteria as manifested in the mixtures of liquid\nresin (Figures 7.8-7.10).\n7.4.1.4\n\nLoad Generating Material Systems: Stalasso\n\nBoston Museum of Science, At the Frontier of Ecological Design Exhibition, 2010\nMany natural structures are formed by processes of mineralization (i.e. bones and shells). Such processes\nresult in the introduction of metals such as gold into a rock. The resulting new composition modifies the\nrock’s structural traits by making it stiffer and stronger. Can we mimic these mineralization processes in\ndesign?\nStructural composites are mixtures of materials strategically deposited to account for the structure’s\nrequired performance. Here this process has been redefined by forming a forest of columns the structure\nof which is defined by the ratio of stiff to soft materials. Each stalactite-like column is locally stiffened\nby an array of structural channels across its length.\nThink of the flutes of the Classical Greek column; these channels celebrated the classical style by providing ornamentation. In this experiment we explored the gain in structural behavior by assigning different\nmaterial properties to them (Figures 7.11, 7.12).\n7.4.2\n7.4.2.1\n\nThe Form of Heat: Heat Generated Material Systems\nVision: Construction Melanin\n\nIf buildings were to their sites what our skin color is to our environment, we could legitimately attempt\nmaking many claims regarding the state and progress of adaptable architecture. Skin color is an accepted\ntypical indication of the geographical region where one’s ancestors had originated (Figure 7.13). This\nis due to a class of chemical compounds found in plants, animals and some micro-organisms, in which\nmelanin serves predominantly as a pigment. Skin pigmentation is directly determined by the amount of\nmelanin present in the skin. Melanin’s photochemical properties make it incredibly efficient in absorbing harmful UV-radiation and transforming it into harmless amounts of heat through a process termed\ninternal conversion. Regional solar conditions have therefore a direct effect on skin pigmentation. In areas in which inhabitants have been exposed to high levels of direct sunlight, skin pigmentation becomes\nincreasingly darker to effectively protect itself from the sun. In areas where less sunlight is experienced,\nthe skin embodies the ability to adapt rapidly when exposed to the sun.\nMelanin, as an indicator of the environmental conditions governing the inhabitant’s “site”, and can be\nconsidered in this context a factor, or variable, indicative of environmental customization, in this case,\nof the human skin color. When extended to design, a design’s feature, as expressed not by skin color,\nbut rather by material properties and organization, may be locally informed by its environment. In other\n\nExperiments in Material-based Design Computation 197\n\nwords, the form, texture and material composition of a building skin can share the same topological\nfeatures when designed for a hot climate site and a cold climate site, but their geometrical features may\nbe considerably different. This condition has generally been referred to as “difference in degree” vs.\n“difference in kind”.\nIn the following set of experiments we speculate regarding the possibility of generating a material architecture informed by local conditions. Mostly, we refer to various hypothesized thermal circumstances,\nand at times explore them as we negotiate between other constraints such as structural stability.\nThe experiments demonstrated in this section are unique in that they share common methods implemented for computational form-finding based on existing analytical platforms. In the previous chapter I\nhave referred to such routines as belonging to the class of Finite Synthesis Methods, based on FE software. The general aim was to generate new forms based on forms found in nature coupled with hypothetical speculations regarding their anticipated “mutations” under different sets of conditions. Consider\nthe melanin case, and think of each such hypothetical condition as theoretical environments in which a\nproduct or building type evolves. Based on the compound relation between a given, constant material\norganization (in our case we refer to tissues found in nature) and a variable environment, we generate alternative forms. These generation processes are based on the analysis and simulation of material\nproperties and the predictions of how such properties may behave under given conditions (e.g. thermal\nflux).\n7.4.2.2\n\nHeat Generated Material Systems: Subterrain(s) & [X,Y,Z,S,S,T]\n\nMuseum of Modern Art, Permanent Collection, 2008 Museum of Science Boston, 2009\nThe physical features of tissues found in nature express the distribution and magnitude of the forces\nthat have influenced their expression. These environmentally driven forces embody the complex relations between physical matter and its environment contributing to what may be perceived of as a multidimensional force field: the immaterial environment within, and by which, form emerges.\nSubterrains are a series of experiments exploring the notion of material organization as it is informed\nby combinations of temperature and load conditions. The purpose of this experiment was to test the\ncapabilities of analytical software to act as a potential synthetic environment for form-generation. Natural\nmicro-structural 2-D tissues were visualized, analyzed and reconstructed as 3-D macro-scale prototypes\nby computing their hypothetical physical responses. However, rather than replicating the expressions\nof such responses in micro-scale, we examined their expressions in building scale, considering building\nmaterials and their properties. In other words, we consider artificial materials as input which corresponds\nto existing behavioral constraints.\nAn object-oriented finite element application was used7.5 to predict and determine material behavior\naccording to assigned properties and performances. Such criteria include stress, strain, heat flow, stored\nenergy and deformation due to applied loads and temperature differences. Physical properties were\nimposed onto the image; a computational mesh is then created that includes image-property information;\nthe computation then produces various data sets (i.e. heat flow, stored energy, and so on). The interaction\nbetween the directional morphology of the specimen and the tensor direction produces physical effects\nthat emphasize the tissue’s spatial texture in different ways. The resulting model is six dimensional\nand includes 2-D information (X, Y), out of plane deformation (Y), elastic stress (S), strain (S) and\ntemperature flux (T). The tissue was then reconstructed using a CNC mill and metal/steel and wood\ncomposites. Anisotropic in nature, grain directionality and layering are informed by the analysis resulting\n7.5\nThe OOF software was developed at MIT’s Department of Material Science and Engineering in collaboration with NIST\n(National Institute of Standards and Technology), for analyzing the effects of microstructure on material properties.\n\n198 NATURAL ARTIFICE\n\nin laminated structural composites the structure of which is informed by the hypothetical computational\nenvironment which has been set up (Figures 7.14-7.18).\nThree natural tissues were examined, each defined by its properties, its environment and its scale.\n7.4.2.3\n\nLoad Generating Material Systems: Monocoque\n\nBoston Museum of Science, At the Frontier of Ecological Design Exhibition, 2010 Art and Design\nBiennale, Seville Granada, 2009\nOne of the unique articles resulting from this exploration was a graphic method representing exclusively\nphysical material data. In this “intermediate abstraction”, the original image is a two dimensional object\nreflected in the density and morphology of the computed mesh, the out-of-image deformation produces\nthe relief represented by the density of the mesh, elastic stresses produce the line-thickness, flux is\nencoded with color data, and stored energy is represented by superimposed numbers (Figures 7.3-7.7).\nThis process was reapplied for three different meshes representing three different cases uniquely defined by their environmental templates and their scale. The images were assigned material properties\naccording to their gray values: bright tones were associated with stiff elastic properties (by analogy, a\nstiff spring), high thermal conductivity (like a metal: cool to the touch on cold days, hot to the touch\non hot days), and intermediate value of thermal expansion (the increase in volume of a material as its\ntemperature rises, and the reason expandable joints are used in bridge structures). Dark tones were associated with compliant elastic materials (by analogy, spongy foam), low thermal conductivity with no\nthermal expansion. Middle tones received intermediate elasticity and thermal conductivity, but larger\nthermal expansion. The combined image and its properties are subjected to stretching and heat flow in\nthe vertical and horizontal directions. The interaction between the directional morphology of the image\nand the stretch direction produce physical effects that emphasize image features in different ways.\nThe results were spatially analyzed and converted to a constructible data structure and graphical images\nusing Mathematica software.\n7.4.3\n7.4.3.1\n\nThe Form of Light\nVision: Photon Fabrication\n\nAs creators of form, we may often discount the function of light as an equivalent contributor to the promotion of environmental performance as are other such immaterial factors such as load and heat. This\ncondition has understandably emerged mostly due to the dichotomy that lies between engineering performance criteria on the one hand, and design, or architectural, performance on the other. However, when it\ncomes to light, there are numerous cases where dark or un-shaded spaces are acceptable. Granted, there\nare few design parameters without which we cannot realize a design. However and as generally accepted,\nlight carries immense environmental implications as well as serves as a means for the manipulation of\nspatial and visual perception.\nWith regards to its perceptual qualities: For Luis Kahn, as well as for many other prominent architects\nand designers, it was due to the presence of natural light that architecture could be brought to life. Light,\nfor Kahn, was not only an instrument of our perception of things, but the very source of matter itself. It\nrepresented nature with all her laws by which all matter is bound. Kahn was especially fascinated with\nthe cyclic nature of light and attributed both significant environmental and psychological significance to\nits daily and seasonal fluctuations.\nBut can light really generate form? There are several ways in which we may approach such inquiry.\nFirstly, one may simply distinguish between the integration of light within the process of form-generation\n\nExperiments in Material-based Design Computation 199\n\nor rather consider its effect post the production of some artifact. In this thesis, I am primarily concerned\nwith the former, the generative form potential of light.\nFrom a generation perspective, the attributes of light (i.e. illumination, refraction as well as intensity,\nduration and direction, etc.) may be included and hierarchically assigned by order of significance to\nthe design. In the case of Natural Computation, as reviewed in Chapter 4, design attempts have been\nmade to treat light as an attractor-like parameter controlling the distribution and organization of building\ncomponents (in the design of a building skin for instance) in, or against, the direction of predominant\nlight. Such is the case known as Computational Phototropism7.6 , where the design product, or building,\n“grows” (or is kinetically designed to “move”) in response to light.\nIn this section we consider two works experimenting with these ideas in the development of tools supporting light-guided material architectures from different perspectives. The first, considers the potential\nfor digital photo-tropisms to inform the “growth” process of a design, as expressed in the design for an\ninflatable furniture piece that expands its volume once pressure is applied; here the aim is to develop a\npacking algorithm. The second explores the potential for light-related surface analysis tools to serve as\nsynthetic media in the generation of a doubly-curved surface, the curvature of which is guided by light\nwith the aim of optimizing against shading criteria.\n7.4.3.2\n\nLight Generated Material Systems: Tropisms\n\nPlants often grow in fashion to maximize the surface area of their branching geometries while maintaining structural support. Indeed, much of natural morphology may be simulated by tubular forms that do\nnot simply expand or elongate but, rather, bifurcate, trifurcate and so on. Tropisms examined the potential\nof digital branching growth systems to be applied in the design of products and building elements made\nof smaller components. Each such geometrical component, defined here as a Generative Component\nwas defined by its volume and direction relative to its neighboring components such that when combined\nthese components form a recursive system. The use of branching growth systems in this case thus serves\nto explore certain organizational principles in natural systems and their potential implementation in a\ngenerative design environment.\nThis work assumes an inherent, and potentially instrumental relation between geometry and performance\nin devising advanced analytical functions (some of which already exist today as built-in user features)\nto support generative design explorations. In historic design conventions geometry has traditionally promoted descriptive manifestations of form. Beyond the realm of geometry, the concept of performance\nwhich may inform such manifestations also carries the important potential for design generation. This\nwork explores the relation between geometry and performance from a computational-geometry perspective. It does so by revisiting certain analytical tools which are offered in most of today’s 3-D modelers\nand support the evaluation of the geometrical nature of any generated surface object, specifically curvature and draft angle analysis. It is demonstrated that these tools can be reconstructed with added\nfunctionality assigning 3-D geometrical features informed by structural and environmental performance\nrespectively. In the examples illustrated surface thickness (as a function of structural performance) is assigned to curvature values, and transparency (as a function of light penetration performance) is assigned\nto light analysis values. In a broader scope this work promotes a methodology of performance-informed\nmaterial form generation by means of computational geometry. In this case vector and tensor math was\nexploited to reconstruct existing analytical tools in order that they might be adapted to function as design\ngenerators.\n7.6\n\nIn Nature, Phototropism is defined as the plant’s movement in response to light. Growth hormones are produced which\ncause the stem cells on the side away from the light to multiply causing the stem to tilt. The leaves are then closer to the light\nsource and aligned to intercept the most light.\n\n200 NATURAL ARTIFICE\n\nDemonstrated below is an L-system, developed as a cellular automaton algorithm. The design takes as\ninput variables describing the initial rules for ‘growth’ and ‘decay’ coupled with a set of local ‘attractor’\npoints orienting the organization by defining its direction of “growth” (Figure 7.19).\nMost importantly, this exploration represents the generative potential of associative modeling environments. As multiple constraints are incorporated in the definition of a “component” (i.e. the component’s\nvariables), it is more than a geometrical static feature unconcerned with its neighboring components\n(as is defined by the laws of“growth”) and its global environment (as is defined by “global variables”).\nHowever, in this specific case the definition of a component, and in the context of its potential to serve\nas a “material unit”, this element includes only features that are geometrical in nature while lacking any\nphysical material qualities in either the processes associated with its modeling or its fabrication.\n7.4.3.3\n\nLight Generated Material Systems: Raycounting\n\nMuseum of Modern Art, Permanent Collection, 2008\nIn 1860, the method of photo-sculpting developed with the aim of regenerating accurate 3-D replicas\nof any given object by projecting multiple prints of different angles, and carving them relative to the\nreference artifact. The method employs 2-D projections to regenerate 3-D objects.\nFascinated by photo-sculpting, which might well be considered the earliest rapid prototyping technology\nknown, I began to imagine a conceptual space in which one could in fact sculpt and alter the form of\nmatter by means of light. In practicality, this would mean surveying the shifts of the sun for a given site,\nand letting form emerge as a function of these conditions combined with the physical attributes of the\npredominant type of material involved, for example, in building.\nRaycounting is a method for originating form by registering the intensity and orientation of light rays.\n3-D surfaces of double curvature are the result of assigning light parameters to flat planes. The algorithm calculates the intensity, position and direction of one, or multiple, light sources placed in a given\nenvironment and assigns local curvature values to each point in space corresponding to the reference\nplane and the light dimension. The models explore the relation between geometry and light performance\nfrom a computational-geometry perspective. Light performance analysis tools are reconstructed programmatically to allow for morphological synthesis based on intensity, frequency and polarization of\nlight parameters as defined by the user (Figures 7.20-7.23).\n7.5\n\nExperiments in Material-based Design Computation: Case Studies in Experimental Design\n\nHow to define the form of something that is not merely objectively defined? What might be considered\ncomfortable for one user, or patient, may result in discomfort or pain for another. This is true for most\nof the design products and buildings that we design. It is precisely this ability to consider and negotiate\nbetween as many constraints with as many variations as possible that make a design customizable to\nthe user. As we have previously determined, the two significant characteristics of natural design include\ncustomizability and multi-functionality.\nTwo additional experiments are presented below as case studies in experimental design. That is, they\nare generally more complex than the previous experiments in, for example, dealing with multiple performance factors. The first is a material informed process for the design of a chaise lounge, and the second\nis a wrist splint designed to treat carpal tunnel syndrome. These product-oriented case-study experiments\nacted as design test-bed environments in which to test some of the methods and tools developed in the\nprevious section of this chapter. In each case, we begin with a particular function in mind that may\npotentially direct the types of performance investigated.\n\nExperiments in Material-based Design Computation: Case Studies in Experimental Design 201\n\nGiven the product focus of the works below, the methods presented are more tightly linked to the fabrication process. Processes were created that incorporate the material properties data (from which the\nmodels were printed), in the form-generation process.\nUnlike the previous experiments, the case studies demonstrated here present the designer with actual\ndata and parameters, both material (desired physical behavior) and environmental, with which to design.\nUnique to these works is the requirement to support parametric negotiation between multiple constraints\nthat do not typically line up. Such a multivariate performative condition is, of course, emblematic of\ndesign, in general.\n7.5.1\n7.5.1.1\n\nThe Form of Comfort\nVision: Chairs that Grow, Buildings that Breathe\n\nHere we seek to explore the ideas of customizability and multi-functionality in the design of a furniture\nproduct. Of relevance to the consideration of these experiments as innovative, is the traditional modern method of furniture design in which the functional components of the furniture piece are discretely\ntreated in terms of material choice and fabrication. As a result, assembly processes are required that\njoin such functional components together. Contrary to this approach, and not without the aid of digital\nfabrication tools, we aimed to synthesize and unite between these functional components. In this way, a\nsingular system of material is locally modified to accommodate for the multiple functions of the furniture\npiece: its structural stability and its comfort, as defined by the user. Here, once again, customization and\nmulti-functionality play an important role in allowing the user to inform the process by which the furniture piece is generated and produced according to a highly-specific set of parameters. Furthermore, the\nmixtures between materials and their expression may be modified to accommodate for such needs. Mass\nproduction processes are here transformed into mass-customization routines that are also characterized\nby their capacity to incorporate and negotiate between various parameters.\n7.5.1.2\n\nCase Study in Environmentally Generated Material Systems: Beast\n\nArt and Design Biennale, Seville Granada, 2009\nLike the mythical creature of Mary Shelley, Beast is an organic entity created synthetically by the incorporation of physical parameters into digital form generation protocols. It has been referred to as a\nPerformative Chaise (Oxman 2009).\nA single continuous surface acting both as “structure” and as “skin” is locally modulated to satisfy loadbearing functions and comfort functions respectively. The chaise combines structural, environmental,\nand corporeal performance by adapting its thickness, pattern density, stiffness, and translucency to load,\ncurvature, and skin-pressured areas in that order. Multiple algorithms were generated that correspond\nto these potentially conflicting variables, such that stability is mediated with a sense of comfort upon\nsurface contact, and structural integrity - with visual and sensual experience. In this light, the chaise\nexemplifies the negotiation between engineering and experiential performance. It is a method as much as\nan object of pleasure; and the method promotes material and structural integrity mediated by the physical\nattributes of the act of sitting and lying down against a hard-soft surface (Figures 7.24, 7.25).\nThe traditional chaise is transformed here to promote lounging of a different kind. The cellular pattern\napplied to its entirety is designed to increase the ratio of surface area to volume in occupied areas where\nthe body potentially rests. A pressure map analysis was conducted that matched the softness and hardness\nof the cells to cushion and support the sensitive and highly-pressured areas. By analyzing anatomical\nstructures that cause concentrated pressures, Beast became softer and flexible where pressure needs to\nbe relieved. The relative volume of each cellular cushion is locally informed by pressure data averaged\n\n202 NARURAL ARTIFICE\n\nwith values representing structural support and flexibility. Its density is informed by global and local\nmean curvature values such that denser, smaller cells are organized in areas of steeper curvature whereas\nlarger cells are found in areas of shallow curvature.\nBeast is printed from 5 different materials varying in strength and elasticity. The surface patches are 3D printed using a new multi-jet matrix technology which simultaneously deposits materials of different\nproperties corresponding to structural and skin-pressure mappings. Stiffer materials are positioned in\nsurface areas under compression and softer, more flexible materials are placed in surface areas under\ntension.\nThe chaise’s continuous surface adapts to the person using it by matching body load to stiffness in\nthe computational design processes applied before its actual fabrication. Its thickness, pattern density,\nstiffness, flexibility and translucency are modified according to load, curvature, and skin-pressured areas\nrespectively. Beast can gauge the body shape and pressure areas of someone sitting or lying down on it by\nbeing softer and flexible where the body’s pressure needs to be relieved. In its full size, Beast would be\nstrong enough to support a person’s weight yet be flexible enough to nestle a human body with comfort.\nThe traditional chaise is transformed to promote lounging of a different kind (Figures 7.24-7.25).\n7.5.2\n\nThe Form of Pain\n\nNature’s engineering expertise is in matching material properties to environmental pressures, be it the\nformation of stiff materials for load bearing functions, or insulating materials as protection from extreme\ntemperature gradients. The human skin is designed in the same fashion and acts simultaneously as a\nstructural and an environmental filter and barrier.\nIn the very same way that load or temperature parameters can be mapped in order to design structures that\nare highly optimized for their function, physical pain can also be mapped in the design and production of\nmedical assistive devices such as pain reducing splints. The experience of physical pain is, in particular,\nvery personal; it is uniquely experienced and relatively differently treated for each individual. Pain is\nespecially difficult to define or to map when compared with other quantifiable data, and it is one of those\nconditions that are poorly understood by conventional medical science.\nThe form of pain was an experimental case study, an attempt to consolidate structural support for the\nwrist with a feeling of comfort in a way uniquely defined by the patient.\n7.5.2.1\n\nCase Study in Environmentally Generated Material Systems: Carpal Skin\n\nBoston Museum of Science, At the Frontier of Ecological Design Exhibition, 2010\nCarpal Skin is a prototype for a protective glove treating carpal tunnel syndrome. The syndrome is a\nmedical condition in which the median nerve is compressed at the wrist, leading to numbness, muscle\natrophy, and weakness in the hand. Night time wrist splinting is the recommended treatment for most\npatients before going into carpal tunnel release surgery.\nHowever, the main problem inherent in immobilized braces is that since they are mass-produced they\noften are too big, too small, or too constricting in terms of mobilization. In this case, as is the case with\nmost muscular and nerve-related syndromes, mass customization (contrary to mass-production) is much\npreferred.\nCarpal skin promotes a process by which to map the pain-profile of a particular patient its intensity\nand duration - and distribute hard and soft materials to fit the patient’s anatomical and physiological\nrequirements limiting movement in a customized fashion. The design generation process involves caseby-case pain registration and material property assignment. The 3-D scan of the patient’s hand, including\nits pain registration, was mapped to a 2-D representation on which the distribution of stiff and soft\n\nExperiments in Material-based Design Computation: Case Studies in Experimental Design 203\n\nmaterials was applied. This pain-map was then folded back to its 3-D form and 3-D printed using\nphotopolymer composites.\nIn this particular prototype, stiff materials constrain the lateral bending motion at the wrist, and can be\nidentified by the oblique trajectory of dark and stiff materials. Soft materials allow for ergonomic wrist\nsupport and comfort through movement. The local thickness changes correspond to strategic areas across\nthe surface area of the wrist in cushioning and protecting the wrist from hard surfaces as well as allowing\nfor a comfortable grip. These thickened bumps also increase flexibility and enhance circulation and relief\npressure on the Median Nerve as it acts as a soft tissue reshaping mechanism. The custom-fit property\ndistribution built into the glove allows for passive, but consistent, pulling and stretching simultaneously.\nThe form-generation process was inspired by animal coating patterns, with the exception that in place of\ncolors we are controlling stiffness variation (Figures 7.26-7.28).\n\n7.6\n\nIn-Depth Descriptions of the Experimental Research: the Case for Digital Matter\n\nThe following sections present in-depth descriptions of several of the experiments demonstrated above.\nThe objective is to elucidate the scientific innovations that were applied in the sequence of experiments\nand experimental case studies. We focus on three cases of design generation informed by material properties in three distinct phases of the design process as described in the previous chapter: modeling, analysis\nand fabrication; the integration between those three processes will be later considered and demonstrated.\nMore specifically, Beast is presented as a case for tiling behavior (variable property modeling); Raycounting and Subterrain are presented as cases for finite element synthesis (variable property analysis);\nThe third framework, promoting variable property fabrication is considered in the following chapter as\nI introduce a novel technology supporting processes for variable-property 3-D printing.\n\n7.6.1\n7.6.1.1\n\nTiling Behavior: Beast as a Case Study of Variable Property Modeling\nOverview\n\nThe research developed in the Beast case study demonstrates the method termed by the author Tiling\nBehavior. We present the design, analysis, and fabrication of the chaise lounge created by the incorporation of physical parameters into digital form-generation protocols. As previously described, the cellular\npattern applied to its entirety is designed to increase the ratio of surface area to volume in areas optimized\nfor a sense of comfort.\nBy analyzing anatomical structures that cause concentrated pressures, the chaise becomes softer and\nflexible where pressure needs to be relieved (Figure 7.29). The relative volume of each cellular cushion\nis locally informed by pressure data averaged with values that represent structural support and flexibility.\nGlobal and local mean curvature values inform its density, such that denser, smaller cells are organized\nin areas of steep curvature, whereas larger cells are found in areas of shallow curvature.\nThe chaise’s natural relation of structural and sense datum is propagated in variable polymer composites, offering a wide range of physical properties. Through these algorithms, force conditions naturally\npropagate functionality. Stiffer materials are positioned in surface areas under compression, and softer,\nmore flexible materials are placed in surface areas under tension (deflection zones). State-of-the-art technologies are applied here for the first time to cater for a large range of physical properties and behaviors.\nThe surface patches are printed in 3-D, using a new multi-jet matrix technology which simultaneously\ndeposits materials of different properties in correspondence to structural and skin-pressure mappings.\n\n204 NARURAL ARTIFICE\n\n7.6.1.2\n\nVoronoi Tessellation: Introduction\n\nTiling has been the subject of many innovative design projects in both academic and practical frameworks\nas it tightly relates to issues of fabrication and assembly of components. This work represents an attempt\nto rethink the role of tiling not only as formal maneuver for the rationalization of form-materialization\nbut rather as a means to incorporate physical behavioral constraints early on in design. It does so by\nintroducing a theoretical and technical approach termed Tiling Behavior which explores the integration of\ntessellation-generation along with a finite-element method approach to mechanical optimization termed\nV-FEM.\nVoronoi tiling appears in disparate fields (Turk 1992). In this method, each tile is defined by the set of\npoints that lie closest to each generated point (i.e., a hexagonal tiling derives from a hexagonal lattice\nof generating points). Many algorithms exist that produce simple versions of Voronoi tessellations from\npoint clouds. Fast Voronoi algorithms have been developed with computational geometry techniques,\nbut the computations are generally time-consuming.\nA Voronoi tessellation is an example of a tiling generated by a random point process, in which the tiling\ndevelops algorithmically from points that appear on a surface by some random or informed process. In\nmost cases, a homogeneous, uniform, random distribution (also called a Poisson process) generates the\npoints. In such a uniform process, no position is favored over another: the Voronoi tiling segments the\nobject at the length scale of the average distance between points. As a result, the tiling is homogeneous\nwhen averaged over larger distances. However, the Voronoi tessellation need not derive from such a\nuniform, random process.\nFigures 7.30-7.37 demonstrate this idea in digital and physical media. The individual texture components\n(i.e., the SP line loops) derive from a Voronoi tessellation, but the point cloud density is a function of\nthe object’s local geometric curvature, demonstrating the concept of curvature-based tessellation. In this\ncase, because local stiffness and tactility depend on local tile size, the object’s geometry is intrinsically\ncoupled to its material behavior, and as we shall explain, the converse is also true.\n7.6.1.3\n\nVoronoi Tessellation in Curved Surfaces\n\nBecause the Voronoi definition includes a distance function (i.e., “closeness” is a comparison of distances), the Voronoi construction depends on what is meant by distance. In the simple p\ncase of a Voronoi\nconstruction on a two-dimensional plane, the common choice is the Euclidean distance (d = x2 + y 2 ),\nalso called the L2-norm), but there are an infinite number of ways to define a distance. For the Euclidean\ndistance, the Voronoi tiles are all polygons, for which each shared polygon edge is (a segment of) the\nperpendicular bisector of the ray that joins the generating point centers of the two tiles. The set of all rays\nconnecting neighboring Voronoi centers is a skeletal structure that is “dual” to the Voronoi construction,\nand is called a Delaunay triangulation. However, the resulting polygonal structure is particular to the\ndefinition of distance.\nOn curved surfaces, such as the uniformly curved sphere, the definition of distance is generally complicated as the tile edges have out-of-surface curvature. For non-uniformly curved objects, the distance\ndefinition, and the algorithms to find their corresponding tessellations are complex and typically undeveloped. In these cases, the tile edges have non-uniform in-plane and out-of-plane curvatures.\nThere are methods to use a simpli?ed distance metric to produce a Voronoi tessellation on a curved\nsurface. An example follows. A point cloud can be generated on the vertical projection of a surface, or a\npoint cloud on a curved surface can be projected vertically to a plane. In the first case, a uniform cloud\ndistribution on the plane produces a non-uniform point cloud on the surface; in the second case, a uniform\npoint cloud on the surface produces a non-uniform cloud on the plane. In either case, the Euclidean\n\nIn-Depth Descriptions of the Experimental Research: the Case for Digital Matter 205\n\nalgorithm can be used to produce a Voronoi tessellation on the projected plane, and that tessellation can\nbe projected back onto the surface. Such methods are possible on limited surface types (i.e., graphs of\nthe form z = f (x, y). The surface’s angle of inclination from the vertical produces the non-uniformity\nof the point cloud: points become arbitrarily close in regions where the surface approaches verticality.\nThe choice of algorithm may potentially have property-related consequences. Figure 7.37 illustrates\nthe effects of this algorithm. A full implementation of an L2-norm on a U and V coordinate system\nembedded in a surface of the form x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) would be computationally prohibitive. An\nalgorithm that approximates this norm produced the final object.\nIn Figure 7.37, note the density increase at regions of large squeezing. The illustrated solution: a uniform\npoint cloud on the 3-D surface is a non-uniform cloud on the UV plane. The Voronoi construction in the\nUV plane produces odd-looking cells on the UV-plane, but uniform Voronoi on the 3-D surface.\n7.6.1.4\n\nV-FEM: Weighted Material Selection\n\nDuring the initial stages of the design, the texture inherits the geometrical features of the design as defined by the user. Such geometrical features, in the case of the chaise, are customized to fit body curvature\ncriteria. The initial distribution of cells corresponds to the type and degree of curvature: smaller, denser\ncells are located in regions of high curvature, and larger, sparser cells are located in regions of low curvature. Material properties correspond to both structural requirements (self-stability with no additional\nenforcement members) and environmental requirements (assigned to the body pressure mappings). For\nthe structural performance, a stochastic computational process was developed, in which stiffer materials\nare assigned to vertical regions, which work for buckling, and softer materials are assigned to horizontal\nregions, which work for bending (Figure 7.32). The probability of a material being stiffer or smoother\ndepends on the angle defining the level of horizontality in the chaise.\nRegarding the environmental requirements, the degree of pressure mapped onto the chaise defines the\nrelative height of each cell, such that softer and bigger silicon bumps are located in regions of higher\npressure.\nThe chaise was fabricated using a multi-material 3-D printing technology. Thirty-two sections were\nassembled, each comprised of five material combinations ranging in stiffness from hard to soft.\nFabricated as a scaled prototype, this project is potentially under way to mass manufacturing. In considering assembly in full scale, some rigorous evaluation processes must be accommodated. In the case\nof the current scaled build, the model was fabricated from photopolymers, which mimic the properties\nof polypropylene. It simulates toughness (Izod notched impact of 44.22 J/M), flexibility (elongation at\nbreak of 44.2 percent) and strength (elastic modulus of 1,135 MPa) of polypropylene. Such materials\nappear to be incredibly robust for the generation of small-scale models and some implementations in\nproduct, and industrial design. However, since most of these technologies are developed for prototyping\npurposes, material fatigue may prohibit full-scale development. In which case, there appears to be significant need for the development of robust materials that can pass for structural loading cases that match\nFEA simulations and functional testing.\n7.6.1.5\n\nDesign Method: Voronoi Finite Element Tessellation Method (V-FEM)\n\nThe Voronoi cells applied in this work were obtained by Dirichlet tessellation of complex 3-D surface\nrepresentations. This process involves the discretization of a heterogeneous curvature domain based on\nthe location of a finite set of behavioral heterogeneities defined by mechanical behavior. The application\nand generation of tessellations based on fitness criteria and material properties has been demonstrated.\nThis approach, termed V-FEM, promotes an alternative to traditional optimization algorithms that are\n\n206 NARURAL ARTIFICE\n\napplied on top of an already existing model. In other words, the V-FEM methods promotes and integral\napproach to generation-through-optimization whereby a finite-element like method is inherently linked\nto behavioral data and geometrical organization.\n7.6.1.6\n\nDesign Technique: UV Recompression Algorithm\n\nThe UV re-compression algorithm implemented in this work demonstrated how to apply a voronoi mapping on highly-complex doubly curved 3-D NURBS surface. The need for such an algorithm was introduced by the difficulties presented in using projections and resulted in extreme UV-squeezing conditions\nwhere point cloud density increases at regions of large squeezing. The solution involved the transformation of a uniform voronoi point cloud mapped on the 3-D surface into a non-uniform point cloud on the\nUV plane. Illustration solution: uniform point cloud on 3-D surface is a non uniform cloud on the UV\nplane. As noted above, the voronoi construction in the UV plane produces odd looking cells on the UVplane, but a uniform voronoi pattern on the 3-D surface. Such recompression algorithm may potentially\nbe generalized to include other types of tiling patterns based on complex point cloud registrations.\n7.6.1.7\n\nExperiment Summary\n\nComplex models that correspond to a multitude of fitness functions require sophisticated tools for their\nevaluation. The work presented in this paper focused on the generation and implementation of V-FEM\nas an approach to behavior tiling. However, the structural and environmental evaluation of this tool has\nyet to be developed. A shape annealing approach to tile-typology that considers the dynamic growth of\ntiles as a function of vector mapping appears to offer one such promising direction.\n7.6.2\n\nFinite Synthesis Method (FSM) 1: Raycounting as a case for Variable Property Analysis\n\nComputational geometry has customarily been used as a means for the description and analysis of form.\nTo a lesser extent it has been made instrumental for purposes of design generation. Central to this condition is the partitioning between analysis and generation. Given the significance of analytic tools to\nthe explorations and potential generation of form, it is the integration of such tools and techniques as\npropositional rather than merely descriptive that may provide the user with the capability to exploit computational analysis as a driver for design generation incorporating built-in performative considerations.\nThe Raycounting experiment, previously described as an attempt to generate light-induced curvature, was\ndeveloped in the Rhinoceros software package using the Visual Basic scripting environment. It assumes\na constructed 3-D surface with zero thickness and evaluates the geometrical features of such a surface\n(i.e. curvature, rate of curvature, directionality, etc). On the basis of these evaluations, certain functions\nare then applied to the existing geometry in order to further enhance its performance-oriented features\nbased on desired structural and light performance criteria (i.e higher curvature regions are developed\nfor shading purposes where such areas are required). The tool created to generate the project employ a\ndoubly curved NURBS7.7 surface as an input and generate a 3-D solid geometry as output.\n7.6.2.1\n\nLight as Geometry\n\nThe main objective of this work is to promote a novel methodology which supports the seamless integration of geometry and performance. It does so by identifying certain analytical representation methods\n7.7\n\nNURBS are mathematical representations of 3-D geometry that can accurately describe any shape from the simplest to the\nmost complex 3-D free-form surface or solid. Because of their flexibility and interactivity as well as their accuracy, NURBS\nmodels can be used in various processes from illustration and animation to manufacturing.\n\nIn-Depth Descriptions of the Experimental Research: the Case for Digital Matter 207\n\nand incorporating them into the generation process. It is this ability to quantify and describe performance\ncriteria in the language of geometrical representation that can anticipate such integration (Figure 7.39).\nMulti-objective representations supporting the designer with various interpretations regarding the potential performance of a design object endorse and promote a design process that is generative in nature.\nIllustrated below is an example of multi-objective representation. The color map to the left includes an\narray of colors ranging from red to blue; red - indicating synclastic curvature (bowl-like surface features,\nalso known as positive curvature) and blue indicating anticlastic curvature (saddle-like surface features,\nalso known as negative curvature). Other NURBS-based analysis tools include geometric continuity,\ndeviation, curvature graph on curves and surfaces, naked edges, and working surface analysis view-port\nmodes (i.e. draft angle, zebra stripe, environment map with surface color blend, Gaussian curvature,\nmean curvature, and minimum or maximum radius of curvature respectively).\n7.6.2.2\n\nReconstruction Analysis Tools as Generative Algorithms\n\nThe aim is to evolve a 3-D geometry based upon, and corresponding to, the geometrical features, as have\nbeen analyzed by the software; the geometry being of any given zero-thickness surface geometry such\nthat this surface may potentially become a 3-D design artifact. In order to simplify this aim, two of the\nmost common analysis tools were reconstructed and recomputed with additional functions supporting the\ngeneration of 3-D objects. Each tool was computed to include a set of potential geometrical attributes\nwhich would be modified according to pre-defined performance constraints. Such attributes include\nsurface thickness and transparency, both of which are computed for every sampled surface point across\nits area. In this particular project, the thickness of the surface is attributed to two types of analyses\nincluding curvature analysis and draft angle analysis.\nMoreover, the thickness of the surface is a function of its local curvature and location (relative to a given\nlight source) as measured at any given point. This thickness parameter adds spatial, structural and shading\ndata as part of the surface’s geometrical description. From this follows that the “thickness” attribute,\ncorresponding to the curvature-analysis routine, may suggest structural stability or spatial enclosure,\nwhereas the “thickness” attribute which is applied relatively to the position of a light source may indicate,\nfor instance, degrees of translucency which display a range of light effects from opaque to transparent\ndepending on the surface thickness. So depending on the material which would later be assigned for the\ndesign, and assuming such material may change its transparency as a function of its thickness (such as\nfoam or plastic for example), thick profiles will be opaque and thin profiles will give the effect of being\nalmost transparent.\nSuch processes, by the very nature of informing geometrical attributes with performance data, demonstrate the very many forms of “translation” which typically remain hidden from the user. The so-called\n“translation” in this case is comprised of operations ranging from curvature analysis to the assignment\nof informed geometrical features based on such analyses. This process is iterative by nature as it may\ncorrespond to an array of geometrical parameters (representing various physical performance attributes)\nand may be applied and re-adjusted iteratively in the generation of the final form. However, the process\nof assigning performative interpreters to geometrical data requires the build-up of some translational\nfunctions to parse the math and turn it into representable performance data, usable for the designer.\n7.6.2.3\n\nMathematical Foundations for Tool Reconstruction\n\nWhen considering how tools of analysis may be modeled in order to incorporate ‘propositional interpreters’ of performance criteria (i.e. the relation between the degrees of curvature to structural performance, or the relation between thickness and degrees of transparency) we assume that geometric\n\n208 NARURAL ARTIFICE\n\nquantities and descriptions may incorporate and represent the physical properties of matter. Thus we\nseek to incorporate physical data within the three-dimensional (thickness) representation of geometric\nform. Geometric form thus becomes “materialized” from the point of view of performance analysis.\nThis potentially renders analysis and generation of computational geometry: iterative in both directions;\ninteractive; and inherently performative.\nThe fields of physics, structural engineering and material science contain numerous cases in which formulas are specified to include and solve relations between physical properties of matter through geometry. Such for example are Maxwell’s “method of drawing lines of force and equi-potential surfaces”\nfrom the late 70’s (Maxwell and Garnett 1881).\nGiven the descriptive capacity of such media, the aim now becomes to rewrite such notational correspondence between various representations in terms of geometry (Figure 7.40-7.42).\nIn these notations, and as previously reviewed in Chapter 4, scalar quantities are those that can be\nrepresented by a single number (i.e. mass and temperature). There are also vector-like quantities, such as\nforce, that require a list of numbers for their description (so that direction can be accounted for). Finally,\nquantities such as quadratic forms naturally require a multiply-indexed array for their representation.\nThese latter quantities can only be conceived of as tensors. Actually, tensors can be generalized to include\nother simpler objects: scalars and vectors are special kinds of tensors. The feature that distinguishes a\nscalar from a vector, and distinguishes both of those from a more general tensor quantity is the number of\nindices in the representing array. This number is called the rank (or the order) of a tensor. Thus, scalars\nare rank zero tensors (with no indices at all) and vectors are rank-one tensors.\nWhen relating two types of vectors (such as displacement and gravity), we are in essence generating a\ntensor object in mathematical terms. Tensors which relate two vectors of the same type are known as\npolar tensors, whereas tensors which relate two vectors of different types are known as axial tensors. The\ndifferent vector types may include for instance velocity, displacement, acceleration, gravity or torque.\nCombined, vectors and tensors make up a space of an arbitrary dimension, n. In most cases this description implicitly denotes some space (no need for an explicit space of position). In order to break away\nfrom the primacy of numbers over matter (or performance), and to allow the user to compute the math\non spatial entities (and not only numbers), we may begin to look at vectors as spatial and mathematical\nthings, rather than purely numerical entities.\nWe may now take advantage of usual vector algebra operations available in 3D space (“R3”) to study the\ncurvature (departing from linearity) and torsion (departing from planarity) of curves in space7.8 .\nLet us now smoothly move from curves to surfaces through the description of the manifold. Manifolds\nare important objects in mathematics and physics because they allow more complicated structures to be\nexpressed and understood in terms of the relatively well-understood properties of simpler spaces.\nA manifold is a representation of a mathematical space in which every point has a neighborhood which\nresembles Euclidean space, but in which the overall geometry may be more complicated. Manifolds\nmay be classified according to dimension. For example, lines are one-dimensional manifolds, and planes\ntwo-dimensional manifolds. In a one-dimensional manifold (or one-manifold), every point has a neighborhood that looks like a segment of a line. Examples of one-manifolds include a line, a circle, and two\nseparate circles. In a two-manifold every point has a neighborhood that looks like a disk. Examples\ninclude a plane, the surface of a sphere, and the surface of a torus.\nA Riemannian manifold is a manifold possessing a metric tensor. Simply put, the metric tensor is a\nfunction which tells us how to compute the distance between any two points on a given space. The\nmetric tensor is defined abstractly as an inner product of every tangent space of a manifold such that\nthe inner product is a symmetric, non-degenerate, bilinear form on a vector space. This means that\n7.8\n\nSince we are interested in curves with non-zero speed everywhere, we can always re-parameterize to achieve unit speed.\n\nIn-Depth Descriptions of the Experimental Research: the Case for Digital Matter 209\n\nit takes two vectors as arguments and produces a real number. It should be noted that the array-ofnumbers representation of a tensor is not the same thing as the tensor insomuch as an image and the\nobject represented by the image are not the same thing. For instance, the mass of a stone is not a number.\nRather, the mass can be described by a number relative to some specified unit mass. Similarly a given\nnumerical representation of a tensor only makes sense in a particular coordinate system. Some well\nknown examples of tensors in geometry are quadratic forms, and the curvature tensor.\nIn the framework of this work, fundamental vector math was used to regenerate the analysis tools along\nwith their added functionality. Two scripts were developed corresponding to the two surface-based analytical tools including curvature analysis and draft angle analysis. The following sections describe the\nsequence of operations that were executed to reconstruct and reconfigure these tools for the purpose of\nperformance-based design generation.\n7.6.2.4\n\nCurvature Analysis Tool\n\nThe “curvature analysis” command in modeling software packages such as Rhinoceros and Digital\nProject is one of a series of visual surface analysis tools. These commands use NURBS surface evaluation and rendering techniques to visually analyze and display surface smoothness, curvature, and other\ngeometrical properties. Such commands may potentially inform or guide the design process in that geometrical attributes may be translated or interpreted as performance manifestations. This section describes\nthe regeneration of the Surface Curvature Analysis command and the process in which spatial and structural information are the outcome of manipulating a free-form surface to give it structural integrity using\ncomputational geometry. The aim is to employ an existing geometry-based tool of analysis in order to\nforesee the structural properties of the input geometry.\nFirstly, let us describe the surface analysis command as it exists in the software7.9 . Following the basic\ndefinitions, a detailed description of the script which was used to regenerate the command in a design\ncontext will be given.\nSome basic definitions:\n1. Gaussian and Mean Curvature: At any point on a given curve in the plane, the tangent line is\nthe line best approximating the curve passing through this point. In addition, it is possible to\nrepresent the best approximating circle that passes through this point and is tangent to the curve.\nThe reciprocal of the radius of such a circle is the curvature of the curve at this point.\n2. Principal curvatures: The principal curvatures of a surface at any given point are the minimum and\nmaximum of the normal curvatures at that point. Normal curvatures are the curvatures of curves on\nthe surface lying in planes including the tangent vector at that given point. The principal curvatures\nare used to compute the Gaussian and Mean curvatures of the surface.\n3. Gaussian curvature: The Gaussian curvature of a surface at a point is the product of the principal\ncurvatures at that point. The tangent plane of any point with positive Gaussian curvature touches\nthe surface at a single point, whereas the tangent plane of any point with negative Gaussian curvature cuts the surface. Any point with zero mean curvature has negative or zero Gaussian curvature.\n4. Mean curvature: The Mean curvature of a surface at a point is one half the sum of the principal curvatures at that point. Any point with zero mean curvature has negative or zero Gaussian curvature.\nSurfaces with zero mean curvature everywhere are minimal surfaces. Surfaces with constant mean\ncurvature everywhere are often referred to as CMC (Constant Mean Curvature) surfaces. CMC\n7.9\n\nThe software referred to in this work is the Rhinoceros and Digital Project platforms in particular.\n\n210 NARURAL ARTIFICE\n\nsurfaces have the same mean curvature everywhere on the surface. Physical processes which can\nbe modeled by CMC surfaces include the formation of soap bubbles, both free and attached to objects. A soap bubble, unlike a simple soap film, encloses a volume and exists in equilibrium where\nslightly greater pressure inside the bubble is balanced by the area-minimizing forces of the bubble\nitself. Minimal surfaces are the subset of CMC surfaces where the curvature is zero everywhere.\nPhysical processes which can be modeled by minimal surfaces include the formation of soap films\nspanning fixed objects, such as wire loops. A soap film is not distorted by air pressure (which is\nequal on both sides) and is free to minimize its area. This contrasts with a soap bubble, which\nencloses a fixed quantity of air and has unequal pressures on its inside and outside.\nTo summarize, a smooth surface has two principal curvatures. The Gaussian curvature is the product\nof the principal curvatures. The Mean curvature is the average of the two principal curvatures. By\nconvention, most of the software packages which incorporate such analysis tools do so by assigning\na color-coded pattern on top of the surface which assists the user to determine the type and degree of\ncurvature for any given surface. In the framework of surface curvature analysis, the color red is usually\nassigned to a positive value of the Gaussian curvature, green is assigned to zero Gaussian curvature, and\nblue to negative value of Gaussian curvature. Any points on the surface with curvature values between\nthe values which have been specified by the user will be displayed using the corresponding color. For\nexample, points with a curvature value half way between the specified values will be green. Points on the\nsurface that have curvature values beyond the red end of the range will be red and points with curvature\nvalues beyond the blue end of the range will be blue. A positive Gaussian curvature value means the\nsurface is bowl-like and is also called: synclastic curvature. A negative value means the surface is\nsaddle-like and is also called: anticlastic curvature. A zero value means the surface is flat in at least\none direction (i.e. planes, cylinders, and cones). The Mean curvature displays the absolute value of the\nmean curvature and is useful for finding areas of abrupt change in the surface curvature. The Max radius\noption is useful for flat spot detection. By default, red areas in the model indicate flat spots where the\ncurvature is practically zero. The Min radius option determines whether the surface includes areas where\nit may bend tightly (so as to generate an intersection) when it is offset beyond a certain threshold limit\ndetermined by the user. In this case, the Red color will be set as the radius of offset distance, and the\nblue will indicate this dimension, multiplied by a factor of 1.5. The red areas indicate regions in the\nsurface which will self-intersect upon offset. Blue areas are geometrically sound in this respect. Areas\nfrom green towards red should be viewed with suspicion.\n7.6.2.5\n\nCurvature Analysis Tool Reconstruction\n\nThe aim of reconstructing the curvature analysis tool was to use the analysis as a 3-D form-generator\ndriven by structural performance considerations. In this case surface thickness is created by offsetting\nthe original surface in a non-homogeneous manner, corresponding to surface curvature. By convention,\nhighly curved areas across the surface have been assigned minimal thickness; while smooth regions have\nbeen assigned maximum thickness. This method allows for the application of thickness that is curvaturedependant on the original zero-thickness surface and acts as a “smoothing” function across its entire\nsurface. This method also has structural implications: the smoothness function allows treating surface\nthickness in the context of stability and orientation. In this project specifically, the aim was to design\na wall-mounted element which would be structurally sound and self-supportive while still remaining\nlight-weight and economic to fabricate.\nThe script was generated based on an existing NURBS surface model. This surface has zero-thickness\nprior to the application of the script. Initially, the script runs an automatic surface re-parameterization\n\nIn-Depth Descriptions of the Experimental Research: the Case for Digital Matter 211\n\nmethod. The parameter values of the surface object are recalculated so that the parameter space of the\nsurface object is roughly the same size as the 3-D geometry of the object (surface generated by user).\nThis function may be executed automatically (by default) to allow for a quick calibration of the parameter\nspace. Proceeding re-parameterization, the script asks the user to enter the number of rows and columns\nacross the surface to establish its underlying geometry and define a grid of registration nodes. Every\nsurface is roughly rectangular. Surfaces have three directions: u (“rows”), v (“columns”), and normal.\nThe u and v directions are like the weave of cloth or screen. The u-direction is indicated by the red\narrow and the v-direction is indicated by the green arrow. The normal direction is indicated by the white\narrow. The u, v, and normal directions may be thought of as corresponding to the x, y and z axes of the\nsurface. The “rows” and “columns” entered by the user establish the granularity of u and v intersection\npoints: the higher the values, the more points distributed across the surface for the purpose of sampling\nor attribute assignment which will take place at a later stage. In the next step the script computes surface\nnormals and plots them in the modeling environment. This function returns two 3-D points that define\nthe normal to a surface at a parameter. It takes two parameters as input: the object’s identifier (the user\ngenerated surface) and an array containing the UV parameter to evaluate. The array elements which are\nreturned include a point on the surface at the specified parameter (given at each u and v intersection)\nand a point normal to the surface at the specified parameter. The normal registration allows computing\nthe curvature registered in each U and V point as defined by the user and assign a color to those points.\nFinally, based on the sampled curvature an offsetting function assigns surface thickness matching the\ncurvature analysis mapping. Maximum and minimum thicknesses are defined by the user and scaled\nautomatically to generate thickness range according to sampled surface curvature values.\n7.6.2.6\n\nDraft Angle Analysis Tool\n\nThe draft angle analysis tool maps out the projection pattern on a given surface from the point of view of\na predefined construction plane. The projection is the transformation of a surface defined by points in one\nplane (the “construction plane”, which is by default the active view port) onto another plane (the original\ngenerated surface) by connecting corresponding points on the two planes with parallel lines. The draft\nangle depends on the construction plane orientation. When the surface is vertical/perpendicular to the\nconstruction plane, the draft angle is zero. When the surface is parallel to the construction plane, the draft\nangle is 90 degrees. These angles are assigned a color map to allow for a gradient color representation\nof the draft angle. The Draft Angle dialog box allows the user to set the angle for the color display. The\ndensity of the mesh can also be adjusted, if the level of detail is not fine enough. The “pull direction”\n(the direction from which the surface is being viewed, defined by the location of the construction plane)\nfor the Draft Angle Analysis is the z-axis of the construction plane in the active view port when the\ncommand starts. The normal direction of the surface points toward the “pull direction” of the model.\nChanging the construction plane before using the Draft Angle Analysis command allows the user to\ndefine any direction as the pull direction. Recent CAD packages include the function for a dynamic draft\nangle analysis which allows moving and rotating the model in real time while analyzing the dynamic\ndraft angle of the model (Figure 7.44, 7.45).\n7.6.2.7\n\nDraft Angle Analysis Tool Reconstruction\n\nSimilarly to the surface-curvature analysis tool reconstruction, the draft-angle analysis tool is applied to\na zero-thickness surface generated by the user. The surface re-parameterization method is applied automatically by the script, followed by U and V registration grid definition and surface vector computation.\nIn addition to the normalized surface vectors, plotted as well are the vectors which extend from the light\n\n212 NARURAL ARTIFICE\n\nsource (or alternatively the view-port orientation point) to the U and V surface registration points. These\ntwo sets of vectors (surface vectors and vectors connecting between the surface and the light source) are\nused to calculate the draft angle, which is the angle between the surface and the light source as sampled\nin points across the surface. This set of angles may be conceptually regarded as a tensor field linking the\ngeometrical properties of the surface to a localized agent outside it, which determines its light effects. A\nthreshold value is entered by the user which determines the smallest angle from which the light source\ndoes not “see” the surface, an angle in which an opening is applied to the surface to allow for more\nlight in. Finally, the range of angles is normalized to fit a range of thickness (minimum and maximum\nthickness is defined by the user) which allows for varied surface sections to be generated. The result\nof this script is a set of planar sections which modify their thickness according to their relative distance\nfrom the any user defined “light source” location (Figure 7.45).\n7.6.2.8\n\nSurface Curvature Analysis Script Reconstruction Results\n\nThe aim was to link surface curvature data as sampled by the program, to structural performance considerations. Varied thickness was applied to each point across the surface which matched its curvature in\ndirect relation: the smoother the curvature the thinner the surface. This added functionality allows the\nuser to directly associate the mapped curvature to surface thickness and to generate 3D geometries out\nof zero-thickness NURBS surfaces (Figures 7.41, 7.43, 7.46-7.49, 7.51-7.52).\n7.6.2.9\n\nDraft Angle Analysis Script Reconstruction Results\n\nThe results, as illustrated in Figure 7.50 demonstrate the variations of behavior with regards to light\nperformance. The user defines the location of a “light source” relative to the existing surface and a\nthreshold value which defines the minimum angle at which a hole is formed in the surface. In this\nexample, the holes are formed where minimum light rays hits the surface (below an angle of 20 degrees).\nAs a result, the hole-pattern formation is informed by the light source location and the threshold value\nunder (or over) which the surface is fenestrated.\n7.6.2.10\n\nSummary\n\nThis work emphasized the generative potential that exists within analytical tools for geometrical evaluation. The assumption at the core of this work remains that such tools may inform the designer in\nthe search for formal expression and that they contain opportunities to transcend the geometric-centered\ndescription of form by linking it to performance criteria (spatial, structural, environmental, etc).\nTo conclude, analytical tools are computed as geometrical statements. These statements may serve as\n“multi-objective” representations bridging between geometry and performance, geometry and construction, and geometry and manufacturing. The work sought to demonstrate such an approach by reconstructing two analysis tools for structural and environmental performance thus providing additional functionality.\nIn presenting the prospects for an emerging professional profile of informed tool-making this approach\nseeks to promote a new model for contemplating form and practicing design. If such a prospect is\nlegitimate, then it is the knowledge of computational geometry that is becoming one of the significant\nforms of disciplinary knowledge of the new computational design professional.\nDesign incorporates multiple manifestations of form from the point of view of geometry, material selection, performance, and construction. Each manifestation promotes its very own method of process\nand media of representation. However, some representations may be generated which support multiple\nmanifestations simultaneously while reciprocally informing each other.\n\nIn-Depth Descriptions of the Experimental Research: the Case for Digital Matter 213\n\nThis experiment attempted to define certain analytical forms of representation based in computational\ngeometry as the enabling representation which correlates geometry to performance by means of generative computational processes. Such enabling representations are in most cases analytical in nature\nand offer multiple translations to occur based on a unifying code of interpretation. Such tools are also\nintermediate in nature, a property which renders them generative.\nBeyond the notion of performance-driven interpretations based on computational geometry methods, this\nwork has also engaged with the notion of computational analysis as a source for strategizing material\ndistribution. Rather than breaking down the design into a series of componentized elements aiming at\nstraightforward and simplified assemblies, this exploration demonstrates an alternative approach favoring\nmaterial distribution over strategies of composition. This method promotes design manifestations which\nare not concerned with the notion of “buildability” to begin with, but rather let formal statements be\ninformed by behavior and performance which result in the gradient distribution of material qualities and\neffects.\n7.6.3\n\nFinite Synthesis Method (FSM) 2: Subterrain as a case for Variable Property Analysis\n\nDerived from micrographs of a butterfly wing, a scorpion paw, and a leaf section, the models were\nproduced by computing hypothetical physical responses of the structure derived from each micrograph.\nIn each case, computational experiments were performed that account for physical responses to structural\ncomponents in the original sample.\nThe computation was performed using a public domain image-based finite element application: OOF2\n(http : //ctcms.nist.gov/oof /oof 2). Physical properties were imposed onto the image and a computational mesh was created with the image-property information (Figures 7.53 – 7.55). The computation\nproduces data for equilibrium stresses and strains, steady-state heat flow, stored energy, and deformation\ndue to applied loads and temperature differences (Figure 7.56, 7.57).\nThe final models are six-dimensional: the original image is a two-dimensional object reflected in the\ndensity and morphology of the computed mesh, the out-of-image deformation produces the relief (i.e.\nspatial texture), elastic stresses produce the line-thickness, flux is encoded with color data, and stored\nenergy is represented by superimposed numbers.\nThe images were assigned material properties according to their gray values: bright tones were associated\nwith a material characterized by having stiff elastic properties (by analogy, a stiff spring), high thermal\nconductivity (like a metal: cool to the touch on cold days, hot to the touch on hot days), and intermediate\nvalue of thermal expansion (the increase in volume of a material as its temperature rises, and the reason\nexpandable joints are used in structures such as bridges). Dark tones were associated with a material\ncharacterized by having compliant elastic materials (by analogy, spongy foam), low thermal conductivity\nwith no thermal expansion. Middle tones received intermediate elasticity and thermal conductivity, but\nlarger thermal expansion. The combined image and its properties are subjected to stretching and heat\nflow in the vertical and horizontal directions; the interaction between the directional morphology of the\nimage and the stretch direction produce physical effects that emphasize image features in different ways.\n7.6.3.1\n\nSubterrain 1\n\nSubterrain 1 is based on a micrograph of a leaf structure. The image has bright and dark stripes that\nevolve into isolated dark patches in a matrix of brighter material.\nStretching the tissue and causing heat to flow in the vertical direction shows how vertical stripes provide\navenues for heat flow (blue to red tones) and decomposes into a more disorganized heat flow pattern,\nbut continues to reflect the underlying morphology of the image. Most of the force (as indicative by the\n\n214 NARURAL ARTIFICE\n\nmesh line thickness) is transmitted by the brighter material, but accentuated where the material alters its\nmorphology over a short distance. Vertical stretching causes the material to store energy (text-numbers)\nin the bright parts of the vertical bands in the lower regions and in the bright matrix in the upper material.\nRumpling is produced by stress transfer between the softer material and the stiffer material; there little\nstress transfer in the bands and significant rumpling appears around the isolated patches.\nWhen the image is subjected to horizontal stretching and heat flow, the laminar structure at the bottom\nof the image restricts heat flow because of the insulating effect of the darker phase—gaps in the darker\nlayers produce short-cuts that produce the heterogeneous pattern of high heat-flux density (blue patches).\nIn the upper region, the heat-flux pattern is similar to that in the vertical loading because there is no\npreferential direction in the underlying image structure, but the texture is rotated due to the direction of\nheat flow. The stress in the laminar region is more uniformly distributed, and comparison of the vertical\nand horizontal cases illustrates the interplay of loading direction and material texture. The homogeneous\nstress state reduces the rumpling, which in this case is produced mostly by thermal expansion contrast.\n7.6.3.2\n\nSubterrain 2\n\nSubterrain 2 is based on a micrograph of a scorpion paw. The image has a skeletal structure of gray\nstruts which are interlinked by a brighter cellular network. This composite structure is embedded within\ndarker tones that will be associated with a very compliant, low thermal conductivity material, like air.\nThe image’s mid-gray and dark tones have contrast that tends to run in the horizontal direction. By\ncomparison, directional texture in the brighter, cellular, matrix is less evident. Properties from this\ncellular structure will tend to dominate the resulting patterns from the physical properties, because it is\nassumed to be a stiffer load bearing material and more thermally conductive.\nFor both vertical and horizontal loading cases, thermal flow seeks out optimal paths for heat conduction\nalong similarly aligned portions of the cellular matrix. Only the fractions of cellular struts that are\nconnected and align with the thermal gradient significantly participate in heat flow. Gaps in the cellular\nmatrix shed heat flow to the skeletal structure. Again, because the cellular portions are stiffer, only the\naligned structural components contributed to load bearing and energy storage. Texture in the pattern is\nproduced by the loading direction.\n7.6.3.3\n\nSubterrain 3\n\nSubterrain 3 is based on a micrograph of butterfly wing’s scale (Figure 7.55). The mesh brings out the\nfoliated structure at the largest scale where the central leaf-like structure pinned to a light gray backbone.\nEach leaf has a vertical texture of bright and continuous laminar materials that are cross-linked by lighter\ngray and darker elements. The cross-links have a horizontal texture.\nIn the horizontal loading condition, the lower-left leaf does not participate in load or conductivity because\nit is isolated by a dark band on its right. While the heat flow is left-right, the nearly vertical highconductivity materials contribute to significantly, but non-uniformly, to heat flow, because heat flux is\nlimited by the small gap between the central and lower-left leaf-structure. Dark gaps within the leaf\nstructure present obstacles to heat flow. The load is born uniformly across the leaf structures and is only\nslightly influenced by the underlying image. Energy storage patterns reflect the leaf micro-structure.\nRumpling reflects the macroscopic differences in the leaf-branch structure.\nFor the vertical loading of this mesh, all of the vertical elements of the leaf-structure are exposed in the\nheat-flow pattern because they are the principle conduits for heat conduction. Within each leaf, most of\nthe load is transmitted by the stiff vertical elements; between the leaves the load is concentrated within\n\nIn-Depth Descriptions of the Experimental Research: the Case for Digital Matter 215\n\nthe horizontal gaps. Rumpling occurs between the leaf structures and within the leaf structure where the\nhorizontal texture produces stiffness mismatch in the load-bearing direction.\n7.7\n7.7.1\n\nClassification of Experiments According to Units of Matter\nClassification Methods\n\nWhen considering each of the experiments previously demonstrated as an individual work it is generally\nchallenging to assess its contribution to the theoretical framework presented in this treatise. Combined,\nhowever, the body of experiments illustrates various aspects of Natural Design and Material-based Design Computation that together form a consistent whole (Figure 7.58).\nIn this section I attempt to classify all experiments by several parameters, each referring to one aspect of\nthe theoretical and technical foundations presented. Within each experiment we consider the following\nquestions as forms of classification:\n1. Within which media is the smallest material unit defined? A material unit may be initially defined\nin either the digital or the physical domains.\n2. What is the method used to describe a material unit? A material unit may be defined using geometrical descriptions (tiling behavior), analytical descriptions (finite element synthesis), or fabrication\ndescriptions (variable property fabrication).\n3. Within which process is the smallest material unit defined? A material unit may be defined within\nthe modeling process, the analysis process or the fabrication process.\n4. By which performance criteria are material units defined? A material unit may be defined by a\nsingular performance criteria or a combination of various structural and environmental criteria.\nSuch may include the various performance constraints previously described: load, heat, light,\ncomfort and pain.\nAs our design challenge calls for a novel way of generating form, promoting the integration between\ntools and the negotiation between performance constraints, I have sought to break down the problem into\ndiscrete experiments. As classified in the chart presented below, each experiment is primarily defined\nby its unique definition of “matter” and the way in which “matter” and “performance” are negotiated to\ngenerate a design.\nAs a result, various techniques emerge that are unified by a material-based design rationale but approach\nthis rationale differently. Some projects examine a material-based approach only in a later stage in the\ndesign process: the texture design applied onto Beast for instance, was implemented only after the overall\nform of the chaise was determined. With Carpal Skin, the form of the glove is dependent on the patient’s\nanatomy, and so the actual texture-generation process takes place only after scanning, In Subterrain,\nthe design is directly determined by the natural tissues that served as a specimen for the prediction of\nphysical behavior; in this case the initial form with which we begin is determined by the specimen; and\nso on.\n7.7.2\n\nEco Maxels\n\nAs previously discussed in Chapter 6, we have determined that in order to promote the integration between form and physical behavior we must consider methods promoting the integration of the three main\nphases in the design process: modeling, analysis and fabrication. We have also determined that in order\n\n216 NATURAL ARTIFICE\n\nthat such integration may be achieved, we must make the assumption that the units describing form must\ndirectly relate to performance input and fabrication output.\nFor this purpose, we have identified several such pairings between performance input types and material\n(or, fabrication) output types. The design itself is, in essence, a mediator between those input and output\nunits (i.e. light and wax, load and fiber-composite etc). We have termed such pairings “eco-maxels” to\nindicate that material pixels defined in the digital and physical domains are organized and oriented in\nways that correspond to environmental performance requirements. Amongst them are included pressure\nmaxels, thermal maxels, light maxes, and comfort maxels. We proceed with a brief classification of the\nexperiments according to these types.\n7.7.2.1\n\nPressure Maxels (STRUCPIX) computational unit is defined by structural performance\n\nWhether prompted by dead, or live-load, and whether applied on a building element or on a furniture\npiece, load is typically a major contributor to the shaping of form. Pressure maxels are defined as units\nof matter that potentially incorporate the relationship between stress, derived from the load applied on the\nsample, and strain, derived from measuring the deformation of the sample (i.e. elongation, compression,\nor distortion). The nature of these maxels varies from material to material. All of the experiments\ndemonstrated in this chapter have dealt with properties of load in one way or another.\nWe have explored three strategies for the inclusion of load criteria within the form-generation process:\n1. Tiling behavior: in these cases, the initial form had already been modeled whereas the pattern or\ntexture applied to its surface is developed by considering both the existing curvature and the type\nof loading cases anticipated. Variable surface thickness as a function of curvature and load is one\nsuch option.\n2. Finite element synthesis: here, the form too has already been introduced. However, it is through\nits analysis and the braking-down of its surface area to smaller finite-element material units that\nallows the designer to treat the form locally against any anticipated loads. In this case material\nproperties may be assigned to an analysis element comprising its mesh.\n3. Variable property fabrication methods may be implemented that support the partitioning of the\nform such that each of the components comprising it is fabricated from materials with various\nproperties respectively.\n7.7.2.2\n\nThermal Maxels (TEMPIX) computational unit is defined by environmental performance\n\nRelative to the type of material assigned to a “material unit”, such unit may carry properties relevant to\nthe thermal performance of the object including, for instance, steady-state heat flow and stored energy. In\nthe series of experimented presented we mainly focused on exploring such properties as part of the finite\nelement synthesis approach. These experiments were informed by physical specimens the properties\nof which were modified according to some hypothetical environmental condition. For instance, we\nexplored how a structure, organized as a butterfly wing scale, would behave like when scaled up and\nwhen performing under certain environmental (thermal) conditions.\n7.7.2.3\n\nLight Maxels (LUXPIX) computational unit is defined by environmental performance\n\nThe consideration of light as a design parameter is challenging particularly due to its properties typically\nbeing considered as perceptive and affective. In the experiments I was motivated by the possibility of\ncombining and negotiating between parameters such as structural load and other visual qualities, due\n\nClassification of Experiments According to Units of Matter 217\n\nto effects created by light. The finite element synthesis approach considers situations in which we are\noptimizing against multiple objective functions as opposed to a singular one. For example: how does one\naccommodate a region (within the design product) that is both “robust and transparent” as opposed to the\ntypical combination of “robust and opaque”. Moreover, how does one control the variation of ranges of\nproperties such that their expressions as data structures generate heterogeneity of material properties as\na function of performance?\nThe consideration of light as a driving parameter for the design was expressed particularly in Raycounting. In this experiment each “material unit” may indeed be considered as a material atom ejected from\nthe 3-D printing machine. The accumulation of such units to form larger objects defines its unique light\neffects through geometrical manipulations.\n7.7.2.4\n\nComfort Maxels (CLINPIX) computational unit is defined by physiological performance\n\nBeast and Carpal Skin were explored as cases examining the complex relationship between engineering\nparameters, architectural (perceptual) effects, and physiological requirements. In this sense, these two\nexperiments are the most sophisticated in terms of the tools and the methods they represent. All three\nmethodological frameworks were experimented with in this context:\n1. Tiling behavior was implemented as a strategy for surface tessellation where each cellular component incorporates material data satisfying local structural and comfort (soft/stiff) performance\n2. A Finite element synthesis approach was implemented specifically in the analysis of physiological\nrequirements both in the case of the chaise and the glove design. Based on the wrist 3-D scanning\nresults, for instance, we generate the distribution of material properties required and so on.\n3. Variable property fabrication was specifically experimented with for the wrist band considering\nthe need for a new technology which directly links performance mappings to a fabrication machine\nwhich allows for continuous variation of properties on the fly by controlling material mixtures.\n7.8\n\nProto-Fabrication: The Missing Link\n\nMotivated by a desire to consider a novel alternative approach to digital design that supports the integration of physical matter (and behavior) prior to the generation of form, the experiments illustrated in this\nchapter explore principles of Material-based Design Computation. Based on a family of frameworks introduced in the previous chapter, each work attempts to develop the tools and design methods associated\nwith these methods.\nWe have demonstrated that in order to achieve computational form-finding processes which assimilate the\nfunctions of form, material and structure; we must design, rather than select our materials and methods\nas architects and designers. The experiments have introduced the idea of eco-maxels: printable 3-D\nphysical pixels that are informed by environmental performance requirements. Various families of ecomaxels have been identified, amongst others that host a set of functions and performance unique to a\nparticular design objective. Typically, such functions may introduce conflicting conditions which must\nbe negotiated in the process (stiff and transparent, light and robust, etc.).\nServing as proxies for material data informed by environmental constraints, Eco-Maxels contain various\nrelevant expressions to the design product. These expressions, communicated through locally defined\nphysical properties and behavior, are distributed as one continuous tissue, to satisfy the design’s conditions and requirements. Such an approach celebrates the conditions of material distribution and heterogeneity over the assembly of homogeneous components. For architecture and design in general this\n\n218 NARURAL ARTIFICE\n\nfield of the (computational) design of material structures with the potential of heterogeneous conditionresponsive material opens a totally new world of design, a world of extraordinary promise and potential.\nGranted, we have explored a multitude of techniques to distribute matter as a function of performance\nnegotiation in the digital domain. However, we have not yet discussed the intrinsic interfacing potential\nof the conceptual and technological innovations of material-based design computation to integrate the\nvirtual world of computing with the real world of materialization. How can such theoretical contributions\ncome to be expressed directly and spontaneously in the realm of physical fabrication.\nThe mechanical response of materials designed and engineered with spatial gradients in composition and\nstructure appears to be of considerable significance in all sub disciplines of design from product design,\nto medical devices, to buildings as well as to the technologies which fabricate and construct them.\nCurrently, there exists no rapid prototyping technology which allows for the smooth modification of\nmaterial properties such as strength, stiffness, density and elasticity as continuous gradients across the\nsurface and volume area of a functional component that is assigned to one singular nozzle. Such variations are usually achieved as discrete changes in physical behavior by printing/manufacturing multiple\ncomponents with different properties and distinct delineations between materials, and assembling them\nonly after the fabrication process has been completed. Such processes result in material waste and lack\nof functional precision. Variable Property Rapid Fabrication aims at introducing a novel material deposition 3-D printing technology which offers gradation control of multiple materials within one print to save\nweight and material quantity while reducing energy inputs. The result is a continuous gradient material\nstructure, highly optimized to fit its structural performance with an efficient use of materials, reduction\nof waste and the production of highly customized features with added functionality.\nIn this chapter we have illustrated an array of experiments and case study experimental implementations\nto apply and evaluate theories, models, methods and technologies of material-based design computation.\nWhat we have imagined and generated in the digital domain, in the series of material experiments,\nin the design of a furniture product and a medical device have ultimately supported and scientifically\nand intellectually promoted a fabrication technology that is their realization in a new technology. The\nfollowing chapter introduces the technology by which to achieve variable property fabrication and opens\nthe lens to a new world of architecture and design potential of which up to now we have only dreamt.\nNow to the materialization of our dreams...\n\nFigures 219\n\nFigure 7.1: Carpal Skin, prototype for a Carpel Tunnel Syndrome splint, 2008, Boston Museum of Science.

Raycounting is a method\nfor originating form by registering the intensity and orientation of light rays. 3-D surfaces of double curvature are\nthe result of assigning light parameters to flat planes. The algorithm calculates the intensity, position and direction\nof one, or multiple, light sources placed in a given environment and assigns local curvature and material stiffness\nvalues to each point in space corresponding to the reference plane, the light dimension and structural stability\nrequirements.\n\nFigures 221\n\nFigure 7.3: Monocoque.

Various types are generated.\n\n242 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nFigure 7.24: Beast. Prototype for a Chaise Lounge, 2008, Boston Museum of Science.

This process\nincludes the direct actions of certain molecular forces and other complex slower processes, indirectly\nresulting from chemical, osmotic and other forces, by which material is introduced into the organism\nand transferred from one part of it to another (Thompson 1952). If we might speculate that growth is to\nNature what fabrication is to Design, then the notion of shaping and making come to include more than\nthe straightforward manifestation of shape. In Nature, form is informed by the interaction of matter and\nenergy; and it is due to the distribution of matter and its properties that such interaction is made possible\nin the physical realm. Moreover, it is impossible to find cases in Nature were an object is made out of\none consistent and homogeneous material. Even when considering the inner fabric of wood for instance,\none finds an articulated microstructure governing the orientation of fibers, determined according to the\ntrunk’s mechanical behavior.\nGranted, such processes have vast implications for their potential contribution to form as a factor in\nsustainability, i.e. as a function of material efficiency and energy consumption. Therefore, what we\ncan learn from Nature as we redefine the field of fabrication in the age of global warming is of greater\nsignificance than simply the advancement of fabrication technology. Can fabrication devices be invented\nto exploit certain of the attributes of material-based design computation that we have defined in the\nprevious chapters and thus be made intrinsically, or “naturally”, sustainable? How can we introduce\n\n274 NATURAL FABRICATION\n\nsimilar processes to those characterized by Thompson as “natural” in the design of the artificial? Can\nemerging fabrication technology, in its potential linkage to material-based design computation and in its\nintrinsic technological ability to produce heterogeneous materiality, produce a ”second nature”?\n8.1.2\n\nMichelangelo’s Way\n\nForm-making in the physical domain operates quite differently from Nature’s way. Since ancient times,\nthe shaping of matter has consisted mainly of processes of component assemblies. Such material components are typically homogeneous in properties and assembly with other components of different properties is required in order to achieve variation in physical behavior.\nEvidence dating back nearly two million years ago suggests that man’s very first fabrication tools were\nmade for two purposes: cutting and pounding, as in early shaping processes (Napier 1965). This definition is consistent with the two distinct paths by which contemporary fabrication technologies have been\ndefined since then, by and large, throughout the industrial revolution. Indeed, one typically finds that\nthe term “fabrication” in its industrial context may be applied to either additive or subtractive processes\nof form-making (Figure 8.1). More specifically, it is relatively easy to distinguish between processes\noperating by the (1) additive logic of building blocks: accumulating matter in layers, in units, or using any other type of additive component; and (2) processes operating by subtractive logic, not unlike\nMichelangelo’s method of sculpting form in marble, as if to reveal the shape concealed by it (Figure 8.2).\nIn carrying forth material-based design computation into fabrication processes, I have elected to focus\non additive fabrication processes, specifically layered manufacturing technologies, and potential ways\nin which such processes could inform the distribution of matter as a function of external environmental\nconstraints in the shaping of buildings and products (Figure 8.4).\n8.1.3\n\nDigital Fabrication and its Ecological Discontents\n\nSpatial gradients are clearly a predominant feature in the way that Nature goes about making things. To\nan extent, there have been various attempts to mimic such processes in industrial scales within a range\nof applications.\nIndeed, the mechanical response of materials designed and engineered with spatial gradients in both composition and structure is of considerable significance in disciplines as diverse as biomechanics, fracture\nmechanics, optoelectronics, geology, nanotechnology, product engineering and even architectural design.\nDamage and failure resistance of surfaces to normal and sliding contact or impact can be substantially\ncontrolled and modified through such gradients. Moreover, the attainment of spatial gradients in building\nscale may have momentous impact on the state of sustainable design: building parts can in this way be\ncustomized to fit their various specific functions. Consider the potential material economy implications,\nfor instance, of the fabrication of a concrete beam which varies its physical properties across its internal\nsurface area. In a more complex example of the potential of spatial gradient production by printing,\nconsider the potential for a “bone-printer”.\nGradient materials clearly hold a profound place in the future of material engineering and the ability\nto synthetically engineer and fabricate them using additive fabrication is incredibly promising as it increases the product’s structural and environmental performance, enhances material efficiency, promotes\nmaterial economy and optimizes material distribution. Beyond this, such a technology further offers new\npossibilities for the integration of engineering performance criteria with architectural criteria.\nCurrently, varied mechanical properties are mostly achieved in small scales, and mostly by injection\nmolding a highly costly process which presents the designer with serious time and size constraints.\n\nIntroduction 275\n\nIn this chapter I introduce a novel material deposition technology entitled VPRP. VPRP stands for Variable Property Rapid Prototyping (Oxman 2009). The technology offers gradation control of multiple\nmaterials within one print to save weight and material quantity thus reducing the energy input and promoting new possibilities for a non-componentized architecture.\n8.2\n\nRapid Prototyping: State of the Art\n\n8.2.1\n\n3-D Printing: the Discrete and the Discontinuous\n\n3D printing machines speed product design by facilitating visualization, physical production and the\ntesting of prototypes. However, such machines are typically limited to using only one material at a\ntime; very few high-end 3D printers which accommodate the deposition of multiple materials operate\ndiscretely (one material is assigned to a singular nozzle); or if they are able to deposit mixtures, they are\npre-mixed.\nWe introduce variable property printing as a novel method and technique introducing the ability to\ndynamically mix and vary the ratios of different materials in order to produce a continuous gradient.\nThis ability would expand the potential of prototyping, since the varying properties could allow for optimization of material properties relative to their structural performance and for more accurate evaluations\nof the intended final product, such as stress testing. Dynamic gradients could also contribute to efficient\nconservation of material usage. This project establishes a novel technology that can produce a continuous\ngradient, using colors as a substitute for material properties. This technology has been termed Variable\nProperty Rapid Prototyping (VPRP) by the author (Oxman 2009).\n8.2.2\n\nComparison to Existing RP Technologies and Prior Arts\n\nVPRP differs profoundly from other similar RP/RM technologies. There are many other emerging Rapid\nFabrication (RF) and Rapid Manufacturing (RM) technologies. Generally all related technologies could\nbe classified by the material phase used in the extrusion whether these are liquid-based (such as stereolithography), powder-based (such as selective-laser sintering), or solid-based processes (such as fused\ndeposition modeling). I review two technologies that are of relevance to the comparison with VPRP: The\nPolyJet Matrix technology, extruding multiple photopolymers simultaneously, and the FDM technology,\nan alternative solid-based fabrication process.\n8.2.2.1\n\nHow does VPRP differ from OBJET’s PolyJet Matrix technology?\n\nOBJET GeometriesT M PolyJet Matrix technology, currently applied to their Connex500T M 3D printer,\noperates by using ink jet heads with two or more photopolymer model materials; the OBJET process is\na dual-jet process which can combine materials in several ways, enabling the simultaneous use of two\ndifferent rigid materials, two flexible materials, one of each type, or any combination with transparent\nmaterial. Each material is funneled to a dedicated liquid system connected to the PolyJet Matrix block,\nwhich usually contains 8 printing heads. Each material is designated two synchronized printing heads,\nincluding the support material. Every printer head includes 96 nozzles. Preset composites of model materials are ink-jetted from designated nozzles according to location and model type, providing full control\nof the structure of the jetted material and hence of its mechanical properties. This enables each composite\nmaterial, called a “Digital Material”, to provide specific values for tensile strength, elongation to break,\nHDT and even Shore values. The materials are extruded in 16 micron thick layers onto a build tray, layer\nby layer, until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured by UV light immediately after it\nis extruded. The gel-like support material designed to support complicated geometries, is easily removed\n\n276 NATURAL FABRICATION\n\nby hand and water jetting. However, OBJET’s materials are deposited by preset combinations; they are\ndistinct and cannot be mixed to generate gradient transitions.\n\nRapid Prototyping: State of the Art 277\n\n8.2.2.2\n\nHow does VPRP differ from Stratasys’ FDM technology and Contour Crafting?\n\nStratasys Fused Deposition Technology (FDM) operates by laying down a soluble thermoplastic polymer\nfor support in parallel to the extrusion of the build material. Parts are created by extruding material\nthrough a nozzle that traverses in X and Y to create each 2D layer. In each layer, separate nozzles extrude\nand deposit material that forms the parts and material that form supports where support is required.\nAnother interesting and relevant FDM technology, is Contour Crafting (CC), invented at the University\nof Southern California by Behrokh Khoshnevis (Khoshnevis 2004). This technology exploits the surfaceforming capability of trowelting to create free-form planar surfaces out of construction ceramics and\nconcrete. The extrusion nozzle has a side trowel, the traversal side of which creates smooth outer and\ntop surfaces on the layer, as material is being extruded. This side trowel can be deflected to create nonorthogonal surfaces (Khoshnevis 2004). However, the FDM technologies presented above clearly use\nonly one material at a time such that variation in properties can only be achieved by fabricating multiple\nparts and assembling them post the printing process.\n8.3\n\nVariable Property Fabrication Software\n\nBeyond its contribution as a novel additive fabrication technology, the implications of VPRP on the CAD\nindustry are most significant and require that we revisit current applications used for the geometrical\ndescription of 3D form and structural analysis of prototypes.\n8.3.1\n\nRepresenting Variable Properties\n\nCurrent CAD applications do not support the descriptions of internal material composition. However,\nsome options exist which employ digital entities capable to describe micro-scale physical properties of\nmaterials and internal composition. Such entities include features such as voxels, finite-elements, particle\nsystem elements, and vague-discrete modeling elements, all of which have been introduced in Chapter\n5. We have concluded that the common denominator for these four methods is the representation of\nphysical behavior and/or material properties by assigning properties to discrete features comprising the\nmodel, weather by using voxels, elements, particles or point-sets. One major disadvantage of all entities\nmentioned above is their consumption of computational power in calculations. Also, the editing of such\nformats is made difficult by the lack of a robust method to relate between them in order to combine and\nintegrate modeling and analysis routines.\nAs we moved away from CAD and entered the discipline of Material Science, however, we found what\nhad inspired the conception of the Variable Property Modeling environment. Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) are characterized by the gradual variation in composition and structure over their volume,\nresulting in corresponding changes of the material’s properties. Such materials can be designed and\nengineered for a specific set of functions and applications. Various approaches based on particulate\nprocessing, perform processing, layer processing and melt processing are used to fabricate FGMs.\nGiven their variation of properties across volume and surface area, FGM’s could also be 3D printed by\nsending the machine a layer-by-layer pixel sheet such that when they are stacked they are represented as\nvoxel clouds.\nInspired by the convergence of ideas from the field of computational geometry and material science\nand engineering, in Chapter 6, I introduced the concept of Eco-Voxels as potential material units which\nmay contain performance data (in addition to geometrical data) in various stages of the form-generation\nprocess. Such elements are potentially representative of variable properties in the generation of the final\ndesign form.\n\n278 NATURAL FABRICATION\n\nThe VPRP technology is supported by a novel method for form-generation entitled Variable Property\nModeling (VPM) able to design, manipulate and fabricate graded materials. We have reviewed the\nelements comprising the variable property computational environment in Chapter 5.\nWithin the VPM modeling environment, the program must translate desired model properties to material\nproperties. The VPM environment gives the value of any property at any point (high or low conductivity\n/ stiff or soft) in order to structure the correct material composition and emulate both its structural and\nelectrical performance. Currently, transition functions that compute gradient property distribution across\none or multiple dimensions do not exist in CAD.\nThe VPM environment is developed in order to cater for such requirements and present physical data\nand material composition by treating voxels as tensors (geometrical entities containing multiple physical parameters), or by computing transitions between multiple compositional phases as extrapolation\nfunctions. Clearly, the distribution of materials must be limited by the boundary of the solid, or, its\ndomain.\n8.3.2\n\nVariable Properties Control Module\n\nThe software control module is written in Processing, an open source environment that facilitates data\nvisualization. Material mixture ratios may be controlled through sliders (Figure 8.5), but absolute quantities are controlled so that only the ratio, not the total output amount, changes.\nColor selection (analogous to material selection in the suggested software) operates according to the\nfollowing schematics:\nUser drags the slider to change the color\n⇓\nSoftware outputs relative motor speed to change based on input\n⇓\nColor change\n8.4\n\nVariable Property Fabrication Hardware\n\n8.4.1\n8.4.1.1\n\nGeneral Technical Descriptions\nMaterials\n\nDifferent colored glues are used to represent different materials (Figure 8.5, 8.7). We melt and remold\nglue into thirds of a stick so that three may be fed into a heating chamber which accommodates one\nnormal stick. Three modified glue dispensers are arranged radially in a surrogate housing such that they\nfeed these thirds into one heating chamber, acting also as a mixing chamber. The glue dispensers are\ncontrolled by 9V motors. Since we use the same pushing mechanism as commercial handheld glue guns,\nthe mechanism must be reloaded after every push, so deposition is non-continuous, which is compensated\nfor in software. The resins used in this demonstration are resin glues. It is important to note that such\nmaterials could easily be replaced by thermo-plastic polymers, silicon rubbers, or other resins8.1 .\n8.4.1.2\n\nSupport Materials\n\nIn solid-based processes, support materials are necessary to ensure the stability of the part in the process\nof printing. Support materials removal can be manual, or when water soluble supports are employed,\n8.1\n\nDifferent materials require different nozzles. Structural materials should be considered for further implementations.\n\nVariable Property Fabrication Hardware 279\n\nthey are removed by simply being dissolved, an advantage when fabricating highly complex 3D forms.\nThe VPRP technology demonstrates the ability to control material mixing in order to achieve different\nproperties using the same nozzle. The technology currently works without extruding support materials,\nwhich are materials deposited in negative regions of the 3D prototype in order to support it in the process\nof building. It is important to note that for more accurate and complex builds of 3D forms, it is possible\nto incorporate support materials, such as soluble resins, that would be extruded in parallel to the build\nmaterials. Much like Stratasys’ machines, one could also implement extruded polymer support.\nFollowing the logic presented by the VPRP technology, support materials may also be implemented\nas variable property mixtures using the exact same method. In this way, support materials can vary in\nstiffness and/or density depending on the complexity of the region being printed. Such an implementation\nincreases speed and efficiency of printing. In the case of density variation, such a method would decrease\nmaterial use in cases where minimum support is needed due to local geometrical simplicity.\n8.4.2\n\nBody and Mechanism\n\n8.4.2.1\n\nOverview\n\nIn order to dispense the trifurcated glue sticks into the same heating chamber, aluminum plates have\nbeen machined that function in the same way as the sliding trigger guides in the original housing, but the\ntrigger assemblies are angled so that the glue sticks will all be pushed into the same chamber (they are\nflexible). These are fastened to a round baseplate with screws. On the bottom side of the baseplate, we\nhave attached a heating chamber. Figure 8.6 illustrates the various components of the entire assembly.\n8.4.2.2\n\nTrifurcation Bushing\n\nEach plastic trigger (Figures 8.8, 8.9) is designed to push a whole glue stick via a frictional force angled\ndownward. We insert a bushing which is a solid cylinder with a third of its arc cut away as shown in\nFigure 8.6, so that the plastic ring guiding the glue stick is reduced to the size of the third.\n8.4.2.2.1\n\nGuide Plate\n00\n\nThe aluminum guide plate is water-jetted from 14 thick aluminum. Its primary purpose is to replicate\nthe slot that would guide the trigger in the original housing. It also supports the motor in order to ensure\nproper shaft alignment.\n8.4.2.2.2\n\nMotor Interface\n\n1. Mechanical Interface: Each motor is mounted to a guide plate for alignment. Its D-shaft is coupled\nto the trigger via a set screw in a hub that is bolted to the trigger.\n2. Electrical Interface: The servo motors are connected to a microcontroller board controlled by\nthe software module (see further descriptions in section 3). On the reuptake (after exceeding the\nmotion range of the trigger), a motor’s direction must be reversed in order to reload. The speeds of\neach motor are independently controllable by varying the voltage feed. For this demonstration we\nhave used V9 motors. These motors could be replaced by steeper motors allowing more accurate\ncontrol of material extrusion and the mixture’s speed and power.\n\n280 NATURAL FABRICATION\n\n8.4.2.2.3\n\nNozzle\n\nA truncated glue gun heating chamber/nozzle receives the glue sticks. An aluminum plate is screwed to\nits side so that it may be attached to the rest of the assembly.\n8.4.2.2.4\n\nBase-plate\n\nAll of the guide plates are screwed onto a round water-jetted base-plate, and the nozzle is mounted to the\nunderside. A tapered plastic bushing (3D printed) in the center of the plate guides the angled glue sticks\nso that they are all forced into the nozzle opening (See Figures 8.10 and 8.11 for final assembly).\n8.5\n\nLimitations and Future Work\n\nSome complex individual components, such as the heating chamber / nozzle and the plastic trigger that\nadvances the glue sticks, are taken from commercial glue guns in order to streamline the construction of\nthe nozzle, although this does not result in the most efficient deposition since, as previously mentioned,\nthe mechanism reloads after every push. The rest of the components are designed to avoid complex manufacture and can be easily screwed together; most pieces are either lathed or require minimal machining\nbeyond a 2-D profile. This experimental setup has certain limitations which should be reconsidered and\naddressed in any future development of this technology.\n8.5.1\n\nMaterial Experimentation\n\nWe use colors as the simplest way to demonstrate gradient printing. However for example, if epoxy\nis used as the deposition material, one would vary the ratios of resin and hardener, but the functional\nrange of the resulting mixture would be limited and must be determined. Other possibilities include fiber\ncomposites, which may be varied in hardness by changing fiber orientation, and selective laser sintering,\nwhich allows porosity and consequently material strength to be controlled.\nIn addition, mechanics calculations are currently limited to the linear elastic response of materials, as\nwith the design experiments presented in Chapter 7 (and, specifically, projects that have been 3-D printed\nusing the Connex 500 technology). There are also size limitations on components made using the VPRP\nmachine (5mm thick material strips as defined by nozzle diameter).\n8.5.2\n\nSoftware Development\n\nMost of today’s Rapid prototyping technologies create products in a point-by-point fashion. Selectivelaser-sintering (SLS) and stereolithography (SLA), for instance, initiate prototype solidification at areas\nof contact between the stock material and the laser as the laser traverses the X, Y and Z planes. Other\nlayer manufacturing technologies, such as 3D Systems’ In Vision machine and Objet Geometries machine, deposit the material point by point. In these systems, the prototype is constructed drop by drop\nusing a modified inkjet system. When supplied with one or more extra jets, both systems could build\ngraded material parts, also known as functionally graded materials (FGM’s)8.2 . This type of graded internal structures is only possible when taking an additive approach to manufacturing. However, it is still\nimpossible to represent FGM’s in a CAD environment. Most commercial CAD systems are in the category of ‘B-rep’ modelers. This means that the inside of the ‘solids’ using these modeling techniques are\nas empty as the volumes surrounding the solid. Therefore, for most CAD systems, even though they are\n8.2\n\nSuch capability is currently limited to the micro scale only\n\nLimitations and Future Work 281\n\nknown as ‘solid’ modelers, they are, in fact just surface representation protocols of the geometry defining\nthe 3D form. All RP production formats, STL predominantly, are thus numerical representations of those\ngeometries.\nThe Variable Printing Method (VPM) offers a novel approach to modeling and fabrication of 3D solids\nas it offers a way to represent the internal structure/composition of the form at individual points within\nthe volume of the part. Currently, this method is explored by using colors as a representation of material\nproperties. In the future, we anticipate that 3D printers will be designed as “FGM machines” which are\nprovided with information to ‘print’ the desired graded material distribution.\n8.5.3\n\nSoftware-Hardware Calibration\n\nFurthermore, the voxel model as presented by the Variable Property Design environment allows the\ndesigner to evaluate the mass properties of the modeled object. In other words, the total material volume\ncan be obtained as a simple sum of all the non-zero voxels of the volume buffer. However, a significant\nissue to consider is the calibration between software and hardware “material units” such that both are\nsuitably scaled by the parameters given by the fabrication technology (i.e. layer thickness, horizontal\nresolutions, and so forth). This measure is a reasonably accurate estimate of the actual volume of the\nobject, since each voxel translates to a precisely quantifiable unit of material deposited during fabrication.\nIt can also be applied independent of the object’s topology.\nCombined with the VPD environment, a voxel based modeler can ultimately provide the capability to\ndesign a composite object with materials selectively placed at individual voxels. There is no need to\ncompute the complex geometries of the interleaved materials because each slice of the voxel buffer can\nbe directly read out during fabrication and several masks per-layer can be created to deposit the different\nmaterials. A voxel will then be of molecular dimensions: we have yet to define the dimensional range of\nmaterial voxels relative to the type of performance being mapped as part of the form-generation process.\n8.6\n\nSummary: Towards a Natural Fabrication\n\nFor earlier civilizations, approaches derived from fabricating form have been guided by what was possible in terms of material resources. In fact, prehistoric time periods are defined by the materials most\nwidely employed for tool-making. (Addis).Fabrication methods by which to shape objects and to construct buildings and cities were equally affected by the tools of an era. Every age, with its materials\nand methods, made its preceding age obsolete. Whether stone, bronze, iron, plastic, or silicon, materials\nwere in many ways the very defining constituents of culture.\nCommon to the ages was a compositional approach to fabrication whereby elements of different properties were assembled to form a larger, functional prototype. Such a compositional approach is consistent\nwith the fact that materials were typically defined by consistent and homogeneous properties. The attainment of heterogeneity was mostly pursued through assembly and composition (i.e. the assemblage\nof concrete and glass, or steel and rubber).\nBeyond the notion of homogeneity, the fabrication of form was typically concerned mainly with bringing\ninto physical manifestation the desired object. Whether through chiseling or sculpting, both subtractive\nand additive approaches to fabrication were involved with the shaping of bulk material with consistent\nproperties across its volume. In this way, fabrication was limited in its a priori informing of any design.\nThe digital age is now affording the designer with almost limitless possibilities when it comes to the\nmaking of form as rapid prototyping processes are allowing the designer to directly translate any modeled form into a physically fabricated one. However, such technologies only support the fabrication of\nan object made out of materials with homogeneous properties. However, in a period so charged with\n\n282 NATURAL FABRICATION\n\nenvironmental threats, material waste and retrofitting by assembly are high prices to pay for the formal\nfreedom. It appears that not much has changed since the Stone Age.\nNature knows better. In Nature, fabrication is synonymous with growth, and the form of an artifact is\ndirectly informed by its function and fitted to its environmental conditions. Such “natural fabrication”\nstrategies are by their very definition, sustainable.\nVariable-property modeling, coupled with a variable property fabrication approach, as presented in this\nchapter are suggestive of a new direction in design fabrication, and, indeed, a new direction in architecture. Not unlike the ways of nature, we aim to facilitate the variation of material properties through a\n“heterogeneous materiality” as a function of environmental performance which thus becomes an integral\npart of the form-generation process.\n\nFigures 283\n\nFigure 8.1: Additive and subtractive fabrication methods as illustrated in natural processes and artificial formmaking processes respectively: Left: Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico. Right: Pieta by Michelangelo.\n\nFigure 8.2: Two images of Michelangelo’s “Dying Slave” (1513-16, marble, Louvre Museum, Paris) are used to\nillustrate the concept of subtractive fabrication.\n\n284 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nFigure 8.3: Laser cut components nested for cutting (Raycounting, 2007). Belonging to the family of CNC technologies, laser cutters allow for the assembly of 3-D pieces from 2-D components. Such process is considered\nsubtractive and is associated with relatively large amounts of material waste. In addition, the physical properties from which the object is made are dependent on the physical properties of the 2-D strips which are typically\nhomogeneous in nature.\n\nFigures 285\n\nFigure 8.4: Image of the laser sintering process applied to generate a 3-D\nmodel negotiating between structural and environmental constraints through\nthe specification of material thickness and translucency level (Raycounting,\n2007). Dark orange segments in the image represent regions within the\nmodel that are filled with material for purposes of self-stabilization. Leftover regions are transparent. Additive manufacturing technologies allow the\ndesigner to control precise locations of material deposition, and, depending\non the material property, to relate to more than one discrete performance\ncriteria (i.e. structure and light performance).\n\nFigure 8.5: Screen shot of control module developed in the Processing environment. Color variation represents changes in material properties as assigned by the designer (i.e. density, elasticity, etc). This software control\nmodule is directly linked to the hardware (3-D printing) module controlling\nthe physical deposition and variation of material properties as a function of\nits anticipated performance.\n\n286 MATERIAL-BASED DESIGN COMPUTATION\n\nFigure 8.6: llustration showing prototype and pusher assembly and their respective components.

The implications of these contributions are considered in the context of architectural design,\nproduct design and material design. Motivated by the desire to consider the possible future contributions\nof this field to sustainable design, the orientation of this analysis has been to promote the proposed\nmethods and technologies of performative design as a means to achieve a novel form-generation approach\ninspired by Nature.\nCommon to these contributions, therefore, is a mandate to promote a potentially sustainable design\napproach inspired by Nature that supports the negotiation of multiple performance criteria in the various\nstages of form-generation while at the same time allowing for the seamless integration between modeling,\nanalysis and fabrication environments. This design approach has been termed by the author, Natural\nDesign.\nThe theoretical contributions refer to the body of experiments promoting and evaluating the foundations\nof Material-based Design Computation through digital form-generation informed by material properties\nand behavior. Material-based Design Computation as a potential field of knowledge is viewed here as\nthe enabling theoretical and technical approach for Natural Design.\nThe chapter is organized into various sections classifying the contributions as theoretical, methodological\nand technological. Theoretical contributions refer to the theoretical foundations of both Material-based\nDesign Computation and of Natural Design while methodological contributions refer to the enabling\n\n292 CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nassumptions, methods and techniques afforded by Material-based Design Computation. The methodological contributions refer to the methods and technical means supporting this design approach through\nthe introduction of design environments included under the categories of Tiling Behavior, Finite Element\nSynthesis, and Variable Property Fabrication.\nFinally, the theoretical and methodological contributions culminate in the invention of a new technology\ncurrently under development and testing in industrial contexts. Variable Property Rapid Prototyping\n(Oxman 2009) has been developed and implemented as a novel technology which enables the controlled\nvariation of material properties during the process of material deposition in a 3-D printing application.\nThis technology combines a novel software environment termed Variable Property Modeling (VPM) with\na mechanical output tool designed as a 3-D printer. VPRP allows for physical prototyping of graduated\nproperties in product design scale based on the design and fabrication logic of Functionally Graded\nMaterials (FGMs).\nWithin those processes of computational design directly associated with materials, it is the computational\npotential for the distribution of material structure (structurally, spatially and materially) that has been an\nobjective of the research and has become a unique attribute of Material Computation.\nThe technical contributions include the analysis of forms allowing property variation in response to\nmechanical, thermal, or lighting conditions; the fabrication of forms with material property and thickness variation over a surface; and the development of a new device, entitled VPRP, which promotes\nthe fabrication of forms with continuously varying properties corresponding to certain given external,\n(environmental) constraints.\n9.1.1\n\nNatural Design\n\nAt the heart of this research lies the following syllogism:\nGiven that Nature applies strategies of material distribution in order to satisfy multiple classes of sitespecific structural and environmental performance simultaneously; given that in Nature we find full integration between “modeling” (genetic code), “analysis” (adaptation) and “fabrication” (growth); and\ngiven that Nature is demonstrably sustainable; then architecture and design may become substantially\nmore sustainable when adopting Nature’s design and material strategies.\nContrary to Nature’s strategies of material distribution, the milieu of architectural design and construction\nto date is predominantly based on strategies of material assembly and property assignment rather than\nstrategies of material distribution and property graduation. Clearly, since a novel strategy to processes\nof design generation has immense implications on the construction industry, the body of theoretical and\nmethodological discussion following the contributions sections demands that we revisit the way in which\narchitectural design operates as a whole.\nIn previous chapters we have proposed that since the industrial revolution, glass and steel remain the\nquintessential modern materials from which to design buildings and cities. As a result functional material\nallotment is promoted: steel traditionally serves the structural functions of the building while glass serves\nthe environmental functions of the building. This holds true for the use of other materials and products,\nincluding advanced structural composites across various design challenges in domains central, but not\nexclusive to, architecture such as product design, medical device design, and the design of construction\ntools, techniques and technologies. It is mainly due to the conventions defined by, and within, the\nfabrication and construction industries that modular components and assembly tool kits for building\npractice are promoted.\nPerhaps the most significant implications celebrated by the introduction of Natural Design into design\npractice and education, is the potential withering away of the module and the component and the arrival\nof a new way of generating and constructing design objects without assemblies. More about this towards\n\nIntroduction 293\n\nthe conclusions as we contemplate the future of architectural design.\n9.1.2\n\nMaterial-based Design Computation\n\nMaterial-based Design Computation is the body of theoretical, methodological and technical contributions that enable and support Natural Design. This body of knowledge encompasses the characteristics\nof objects and buildings naturally designed, and suggests methods by which to achieve them given their\npotential performance superiority over conventional practice and having observed their advantages as\ndemonstrated through the experimental research.\nGuided by the general thesis that design based merely on geometrical shape does not generally promote\nsustainable design; Material-based Design Computation offers certain form-generation processes, introduced in various stages of the design,that integrate physical properties prior to materializing the final\ndesign output. In this way, the designer may correspond to, and negotiate between, multiple types of\nperformance as demanded by the design environment. Such classes of performances include both engineering and architectural performance, distinguished in this thesis as two separate classes of parameters.\nMaterial properties are typically assigned only after the 3D form has been generated, in order to fulfil\nfunctional and aesthetic objectives as well as to satisfy given building codes. As a result, form, structure\nand material are treated as disintegrated constituents of the design object. Material-based Design Computation promotes generative design processes based on material properties and behavior responding to\nspecific performance constraints. As a result, the generation process allows for multi-performance criteria to be considered and for the integration between form and its material constituents to be achieved\nwithin various stages of the design process.\nBeyond the possibility to address performance criteria early in the design process, the methods allow\nfor the integration of modeling, analysis and fabrication environments culminating in a new fabrication\ninvention that allows the simultaneously mapping, forming-generating and 3-D printing of parts with\ngraduated material properties as defined by the environment. Design in this way, is perceived virtually\nas a second nature.\n9.2\n9.2.1\n\nMaterial-based Design Computation: Theoretical Contributions\nNew Sustainable Design Approach\n\nWhile the practical application varies among disciplines, the common principles of sustainable approaches to design continue to revolve around strategies of improving the efficiency of already existing forms (McLennan 2006). For instance, design standards promote the use of low-impact materials;\nthose that are non-toxic, sustainably produced, or recycled materials which require little energy to process. Alternatively, guidelines suggest the use of manufacturing processes requiring less energy. Most\nof these codes are precisely that codes indicating what ways might best increase efficiency by reducing\nwaste and energy (Anastas and Zimmerman 2003). However, what is now beginning to be considered\nas “sustainability science” still seems to avoid disciplinary content. As a result of this tendency towards\nimproving the design status quo, the methodological integration between form-generation, evaluation\nand fabrication (Oxman 2007; Oxman 2007; Oxman and Rosenberg 2007) has not yet emerged as a\nlogical alternative. Not once in Hannover’s Bill of Rights for the Planet is such integration mentioned or\nreferred to while considering its potentially radical positive impact on sustainable design (McDonough\nand Braungart 1992).\nRather than separately considering form, structure and material in the process of design, this thesis suggests an alternative approach for the generation of form merging its three constituents and assigning\n\n294 CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nthem equal value in the design process (Oxman 2007; Oxman 2007; Oxman and Rosenberg 2007). Engineering performance is thus considered early in the design generation process, along with the potential\nconsideration of material impact on efficiency increase and waste decrease. Moreover, rather than considering materials as inferior to the generation of form, the thesis speculates upon the potential positive\nimplications of design guided by material properties and behavior; that is, design that originates from\nmaterial properties rather than design that is terminated with their assignment.\nFurthermore and most importantly, in this research, it has been demonstrated that a graduated material\napproach, which promotes the heterogeneous distribution of materials as a function of their anticipated\nfunction, allows for the potential to negotiate between multiple properties within the same object (considering structure, light, humidity, sound etc) as well as the achievement of potentially highly optimized\nstructures customized to fit their particular environment as defined by the designer. All of this can be\nachieved through the integration of digital and physical media in the various stages of design generation.\n9.2.2\n\nComputationally-driven Form-Finding\n\nPhysically driven form-generation processes are not novel. They have been around for many years in\nvarious forms serving a wide range of different purposes. Most notable, and of relevance to this thesis,\nare the experiments carried out by Frei Otto and his teams in the late 1950’s (Otto, Rasch et al. 1995).\nBecoming the world’s leading authority on lightweight tensile and membrane structures, Otto pioneered\nadvances in structural mechanics and civil engineering (Otto, Nerdinger et al. 2005). The collective\nbody of experiments testing the forms that emerge out of the interaction between material and load is\nknown today as “form-finding” (Otto, Glaeser et al. 1972). However, as Otto and his team members\nwere uniquely interested in structural efficiency, and given that most of these experiments were executed\nin the physical domain without the aid of computational tools, the scope and impact of these processes\nwas somewhat limited.\nIn this research I have explored the role of computationally-enabled form-finding processes in the generation of form informed by factors that are not limited to structural constraints. The experiments developed\nin this thesis demonstrate that multiple performances – including structural and environmental – may be\naccommodated in the process of form-finding, generaion and optimization. Through the development of\nspecific methods and tools, this research opens up possibilities for the generation of form based not on a\nsingular criterion, but on multiple performance criteria negotiated to express a specific set of functions.\nIn this respect, the thesis specifically provides for architectural performance criteria to be incorporated\nin processes of formal exploration.\n9.2.3\n\nEngineering Performance vs. Architectural Performance\n\nVarious attempts have been made to define the role of form-finding contrary to that of form-making, the\nlatter being a formally and aesthetically motivated design process. When considering the relevant literature sources presented in this thesis it becomes clear that such a distinction thrives on the partitioning between architect and engineer. Defined in this thesis as the process whereby form precedes the analysis of\nprogrammatic influences and design constraints, form-making is associated with processes of inspiration\nand refinement. Hence, form without explicit function might be considered the most extreme expression\nof form-making (i.e. architecture as sculptural art). Alternatively, extreme form-finding, serving the generation of form that is exclusively determined by function, may be regarded as the pure expressions of\napplied engineering. Clearly, architectural design methodologies known to date fall between these two\nextremes, and it has been argued that many canonical works result from design processes that optimally\nbalance form-making and form-finding.\n\nMaterial-based Design Computation: Theoretical Contributions 295\n\nIn this thesis it has been proposed that various criteria which may not be considered for instance as\nengineering criteria may still be incorporated into the form-generation process. Central to this position\nis the distinction between architectural and engineering performance, both of which serve the architect\nin creative discoveries of formal nature. Here is it imperative to mention that unlike Nature, design\nprocesses are motivated by constraints that are not always objectively defined.\nContained within such distinction are parameters such as physiological comfort (in the case of Beast)\nand pain (in the case of Carpal Skin) which are based on conditions subjectively and specifically defined\nby the user or patient. In these explorations, engineering performance parameters (such as functions optimized for the minimum material to accommodate for the maximum loading conditions) and architectural\nperformance parameters (such as functions optimized for particular effects of light facilitated by the relative translucency offered by a material) are integrated within a singular and consistent form-generation\nprocess.\n9.3\n\nMaterial-based Design Computation: Methodological Contributions\n\nMethodological contributions focus on strategies of formal generation through simulated-growth, subdivision, or a combination of both. In other words, all experiments have been generated by the graduated\nassignment of physical properties relative to specific performance constraints defined by the designer\neither when combined with some algorithmic process defining formal generation (i.e. cellular automata\ncombined with FE analysis) or when applied as a subdivision (tessellation) strategy given initial surface\nfeatures. Variable property modeling, analysis and fabrication are respectively mapped to three methods for formal subdivision and growth informed by the interaction between material properties and the\nenvironment.\n9.3.1\n\nVariable Property Modeling: Tiling Behavior (Subdivision)\n\nTiling-behavior is a methodological approach to form-generation allowing the designer the assignment\nof physical performance criteria to geometrically tessellated doubly-curved surfaces. The method developed in this research enables the designer to integrate material properties and behavior as part of\nthe modeling process, while corresponding to a multitude of fitness functions. Specific work presented\nfocused on the generation and implementation of a voronoi-based finite-element analysis application\ntermed V-FEM (Oxman 2009) as an approach to tiling behavior. It promotes an alternative to traditional\noptimization algorithms that are applied on top of an already existing model. In other words, the V-FEM\nmethod promotes an integral approach to generation through optimization, whereby a finite element-like\nmethod is inherently linked to behavioral data and geometrical organization.\nTiling has been the subject of many innovative design projects in both academic and practical frameworks, as it closely relates to issues of fabrication and assembly of components. This work represents\nan attempt to rethink the role of tiling not as a formal maneuver for the rationalization of form materialization but, rather, as a means to incorporate physical behavioral constraints early on in design. It\ndoes so by introducing a theoretical and technical approach, entitled Tiling Behavior, which explores the\nintegration of tessellation generation with a finite element method approach to mechanical optimization,\nentitled V-FEM.\nThe Voronoi cells applied in the project, Beast, were obtained by Dirichlet tessellation of complex 3-D\nsurface representations. This process involves the discretization of a heterogeneous curvature domain,\nbased on the location of a finite set of behavioral heterogeneities that are defined by mechanical behavior.\nThe UV re-compression algorithm implemented in this work demonstrated how to apply a Voronoi mapping on a highly complex, doubly curved 3-D NURBS surface. The need for such an algorithm was\n\n296 CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nintroduced by the difficulties presented in using projections, and resulted in extreme UV-squeezing conditions where point cloud density increases at regions of large squeezing. The solution involved the\ntransformation of a uniform Voronoi point cloud mapped on the 3-D surface into a non-uniform point\ncloud on the UV plane. The Voronoi construction in the UV plane produces odd-looking cells on the UVplane, but a uniform Voronoi pattern on the 3-D surface. Such a recompression algorithm may potentially\nbe generalized to include other types of tiling patterns based on complex point cloud registrations.\nComplex models that correspond to a multitude of fitness functions require sophisticated tools for their\nevaluation. Project Beast focused on the generation and implementation of V-FEM as an approach to\nbehavior tiling. However, the structural and environmental evaluation of this tool has yet to be developed.\nA shape-annealing approach to tile typology that considers the dynamic growth of tiles as a function of\nvector mapping appears to offer one such promising direction. Finally, the method demonstrates that\ngeometrical tessellation can be informed by physical constraints beyond its general application as a\nrationalizing strategy for fabrication purposes.\n9.3.2\n\nVariable Property Analysis: Finite Element Synthesis (Subdivision and Growth)\n\nFinite element analysis methods and their practical applications9.1 are primarily applied to evaluate a\ngiven design relative to some objective function. Currently advanced applications exist that support\nthe integration of form-generation and evaluation from a structural perspective. Such are, for instance,\ntools developed for automobile shape optimization routines based on the types of loads considered,\ntheir magnitudes and directions. However, despite their generative advantage, such tools have yet to\nincorporate multiple performance criteria as part of the form-generation process.\nThe Finite Synthesis Method (FSM) was developed as a theoretical approach and methodology supporting the integration of modeling and analysis routines in the process of form-generation. It affords the\ndesigner the ability to consider analysis tools for their generative impact while corresponding to various\nperformance criteria. In order to further implement this approach within a design environment, the concept of material elements has been introduced, whereby each element as defined by the FE application\nmay contain, in addition to its structural data, information regarding other performance criteria that are\nof interest to the designer. In this regard, each material element is regarded as a tensor element defined\nby indices negotiating various objective functions. This method supports the distribution of properties\nacross the entire surface area of the design object relative to the various architectural and engineering\nperformance criteria addressed.\nBeyond the notion of performance-driven interpretations based on computational geometry methods, this\nwork has also engaged with the notion of computational analysis as a source for strategizing material\ndistribution. Rather than breaking down the design into a series of componentized elements aiming at\nstraightforward and simplified assemblies, the experiments undertaken in this research demonstrate an\nalternative approach favoring material distribution over strategies of composition.\nTo conclude, analytical tools are computed as geometrical statements. These statements may serve\nas bridging (or “multi-objective”) representations between geometry and performance, geometry and\nconstruction, and geometry and manufacturing. With the project Raycounting, the research sought to\ndemonstrate such an approach by reconstructing two analysis tools for structural and environmental performance with additional functionality.\nIn presenting the prospects for an emerging professional profile of informed tool-making this work seeks\nto promote a new model for contemplating form and practicing design. If such a prospect is legitimate,\n9.1\nNumerical techniques for finding approximate solutions involving various domains (such as air, water etc) in which the\ndesign object is sited and by which its performance is informed\n\nMaterial-based Design Computation: Methodological Contributions 297\n\nthen it is the knowledge of computational geometry that is becoming one of the significant forms of\ndisciplinary knowledge of the new computational design professional.\n9.3.3\n\nVariable Property Fabrication: Multi-Material 3-D Printing (Growth)\n\nThe FSM approach assumes and facilitates the distribution of multiple material properties as a function\nof site-specific constraints of various types. In other words, for each material element, the size and shape\nof which is defined within the FE software, there exists a list of related properties specifically defined for\nthat element. The next step is to fabricate the designed object such that all material criteria defined for\neach element would be manifest within the physical object. The variable property fabrication method\nwas developed to support the physical production of design objects while maintaining the distribution of\nproperties.\nCurrently there exist no fabrication technologies that allow for the production of objects with gradually\nvarying structural properties. This thesis demonstrated that such a need is justified given the potential\nadvantages in terms material and mechanical efficiencies. In addition, the thesis has confirmed that\nan integrated approach to form-generation where fabrication processes play an active role in the formgeneration process, allows for more efficient products and building parts to be fabricated allowing the\ndesigner to include evaluative functions early in the design process.\n9.4\n9.4.1\n\nMaterial-based Design Computation: Technological Contributions\nVariable Property Rapid Prototyping\n\nSince its introduction in the late 1980s, layered manufacturing has become increasingly common and\nefficient as a means of delivering functional and visually representative prototypes in relatively short\namounts of time using CAD files as input. However, most layered manufacturing technologies known\ntoday produce only single material, constant property prototypes from a limited array of materials.\nWhile conventional layered manufacturing technologies have given us the opportunity to create complex\nmodels in relatively short periods of time, the technology is also very limiting, often reducing material\nselection to an array of highly brittle, inelastic materials. Objet Geometries, an international 3D printing\ncompany, recently introduced their Connex Series, a line of 3D printers that use Polyjet Matrix TM\nTechnology to allow the creation of dual material prototypes. This technology has also allowed the\ngeneration of composite material prototypes of varying stiffness. However, single material, varying\nproperty layered manufacturing technology has not yet been introduced.\nThe technology offered by Variable Property Rapid Prototyping (VPRP) represents an alternative approach to layer-manufacturing, namely, a layered manufacturing product that, while using a single material, produces a design object of varying material properties.\nVPRP is a novel approach and method introducing the ability to dynamically mix and vary the ratios of\ndifferent materials in order to produce a continuous gradient in a 3-D printed part. This ability expands\nthe potential of prototyping, since the variation of properties allows for optimization of material properties relative to their structural performance as well as more accurate evaluations of the intended final\nproduct, such as stress testing. Dynamic gradients also contribute to efficient conservation of material\nusage. The VPRP pending patent (Oxman 2009) establishes a novel nozzle that can produce a continuous\ngradient, using colors as a substitute for material properties.\nVPRP could potentially be applied to support materials within the printing process. Support materials\nare designed as temporary deposited structures that allow for a stable build to be prototyped. These\n\n298 CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nstructures, for the most part, are removed from the final model by decomposition, melting, heating or\nmechanical removal. However, such constructions are extremely wasteful. The ability to 3D print with\nvariable properties may potentially eliminate the need to extrude support material by varying the relative\nthickness of the functional part in regions of under cuts and/or geometrical perimeters which require\nmore strength in order to self-stabilize in the build process and also as the part dries out. Moreover,\nan intermediary step towards the application of such ideas could potentially be applied to existing support materials themselves; by offering variable property support, parts could be excavated with ease as\nstronger support pieces cling to more fragile areas within the print.\nFinally, VPRP represents the first rapid prototyping technology which allows for modifying material\nproperties such as strength, stiffness, density and elasticity as continuous gradients across the surface\nand volume area of a functional component in construction scale. Given that such variations are typically achieved as discrete changes in physical behavior9.2 they often result in material waste and lack\nof functional precision. VPRP introduces the ability to dynamically mix, grade, and vary the ratios of\ndifferent materials in order to produce a continuous gradient, highly optimized to fit its structural performance with an efficient use of materials, reduction of waste, and the production of a highly customizable\nfeatures with added functionalities.\n9.4.2\n\nEco-Maxels: A Variable Property Modeling Environment\n\nIn addition, VPRP also explores a new approach to fabrication that challenges the concept of ComputerAided Manufacturing (CAM) by introducing a software application that, rather than providing a means\nof digitizing the geometry of a completed design, allows engineers and designers to create and design\nstructures that are defined at various points by their material behavior as opposed to their geometry.\nMost of today’s Rapid Prototyping technologies create products in a point-by-point fashion. Selectivelaser-sintering (SLS) and stereolithography (SLA), for instance, initiate prototype solidification at areas\nof contact between the stock material and the laser as the laser traverses the X, Y and Z planes. Other\nlayer manufacturing technologies, such as 3D Systems’ In Vision machine and Objet Geometry’s machine, deposit the material point by point. In these systems, the prototype is constructed drop by drop\nusing a modified inkjet system. When supplied with one or more extra jets, both systems could build\ngraded material parts, also known as “functionally graded materials” (FGM’s). This type of graded internal structure is only possible when taking an additive approach to manufacturing. However, it is still\nimpossible to represent FGM’s in a CAD environment. Most commercial CAD systems are in the category of ‘B-rep’ modelers. This means that the inside of the ‘solids’ using these modeling techniques are\nas empty as the volumes surrounding the solid. Therefore, for most CAD systems, even though they are\nknown as ‘solid’ modelers, they are, in fact just surface representation protocols of the geometry defining\nthe 3D form. All RP production formats, STL predominantly, are thus numerical representations of those\ngeometries.\nThe Variable Printing Method (VPM) offers a novel approach to modeling and fabrication of 3D solids\nas it offers a way to represent the internal structure/composition of the form at individual points within\nthe volume of the part. Currently, this method is explored by using colors as a representation of material\nproperties. In the future, we anticipate that 3D printers will be designed as “FGM machines” which are\nprovided with information to ‘print’ the desired graded material distribution.\nIt is expected that new CAD systems such as the VPM environment could also be applied for the design\nor Functionally Graded Materials using the same application logic in micro scales. Such developments\n9.2\nSuch changes are achieved by printing multiple components with different properties, defining delineations between materials, and assembling them only after the fabrication process has been completed\n\nMaterial-based Design Computation: Technological Contributions 299\n\nwill most probably occur independently from other developments in CAD for rapid prototyping and\nmanufacturing.\nIt is also expected that such innovations in rapid prototyping technologies will find their way into rapid\nmanufacturing parallel to the development of more structural materials and an increase in scale. Currently, all developments in rapid manufacturing have been aligned with and dependent upon, traditional\nCAD environments. However, the VPM environment contributes to a radical shift from contour modeling composition modeling, allowing for new capabilities in performance modeling, with a decrease in\nmaterial waste and an increase in efficiency.\nA voxel represents a volume element in volume graphics just as a pixel denotes a picture element in\nraster graphics. Voxelization is the process of converting a geometrically represented 3d object into a\nvoxel model. Kaufman proposed that graphics is ready to shift paradigms from 2 d raster graphics to\n3d volume graphics with implications similar to these of the earlier shift from vector to raster graphics.\nVoxel research however has mostly focused at the informative display of volume data. We propose here\na voxel based approach to geometric modeling for new layered manufacturing technologies.\nThe voxel-based approach for geometric modeling supported by the concept of Eco-Maxels offers a\npowerful methodology for the new variable prototyping technology. It has several advantages over conventional modeling methods, stemming chiefly from the close resemblance between a voxel model of an\nobject and the object fabricated using an LM technology. The design of an interactive environment for\nvoxels sculpting is the critical factor that will bring out the full power of the voxel-based approach to\ngeometric modeling and is the focus of our current efforts.\nThe voxel based approach can exploit a major capability of LM equipment: the fabrication of composite\nobjects. The range of materials that current commercial LM systems handle is limited but growing.\nIt is very likely that in the near future, LM technology will mature to fabricate a single component\nfrom multiple materials. Conventional design tools are not oriented to the design of composite objects.\nSpecialized tools are used in areas such as the aircraft industry in which composite materials play a major\nrole. However, advances in LM technologies promise to bring composites into the domain of the average\nmechanical component.\nA voxel based modeler can ultimately provide the capability to design a composite object with materials\nselectively placed at individual voxels. There is no need to compute the complex geometries of the\ninterleaved materials because each slice of the voxel buffer can be directly read out during fabrication\nand several masks per layer can be created to deposit the different materials. Such capabilities will be\nindispensable as the technology of micro-electro-mechanical systems mature. A voxel will then be of\nmolecular dimensions.\nWith voxel-based modeling, a solution is feasible because of the direct relationship between a voxel\nand the basic additive resolution of the LM equipment. The relationship implies that the surface area\nof the resulting object can be estimated by identifying the exposed voxels in the model, adding the\narea contributed by the voxel faces on the boundary, and using suitable filters to simulate the effects of\nmerging and coagulation behaviors in the real material. Properties such as friction coefficients, surface\nroughness, and contact area between interacting parts can be estimated and accommodated.\nFinally, another important contribution of the voxel-based approach, in contrast to traditional vector\nmodeling, is that it eliminates the need for an intermediate format as well as for a post processing step\nbeyond the designer’s control9.3 .\n9.3\n\nTypically, the component is modeled, and then analyzed using a finite-element analysis module. The design must then be\niterated to account for the analysis results and the model is output in a given format for fabrication. Because of discretization processes inherent in layered manufacturing the resulting component could have properties different from what the CAD\nanalysis predicted.\n\n300 CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n9.5\n9.5.1\n\nCurrent Limitations\nTabula Rasa: Design by Immaculate Conception?\n\nAn important assumption underlying this research is that form may be generated without explicit geometrical content (that is: form), but rather as the byproduct of matching material parameters and environmental constraints. The main design model proposed in this thesis supports such a process by considering\nthe landscape of design possibilities as the interaction between force and matter, and between energy and\nmatter. Eco-maxels are conceived of as the units by which to technically achieve such a concept of design. However, this model is yet to be developed as a robust design platform. Due to the difficulty of\ndefining the origin of form within each of the experiments, I have alluded to strategies that combine more\ntraditional form-generation with analytical iterations.\nIt is important to note that the mechanics calculations, for most part of the experiments presented in\nChapter 7, are limited to the linear-elastic response of materials. Further experiments should be carried\nthat explore various types of material and responses in correspondence to the types of forces exerted.\nRegarding experiments focusing on surface subdivision: having focused on the customized reconstruction of analytical tools and their ability to contribute to explorations driven by performance parameters,\nthe main limitations of this thesis remain its dependency on the initial form to be analyzed. In other\nwords, this application assumes the initial generation of preliminary geometry constructed by the user,\nand applies the evaluation and modification on top of it. The question relating to the origin(s) of form\nremains to be discussed and engaged with in another context. And indeed, the notion of where generation\nends and evaluation begins will forever remain complex, and perhaps so it should.\n9.5.2\n\nCells, Tissues, Organs: The Limits of Distribution\n\nIn this thesis I have chosen to experiment with design challenges that are relatively small in scale from an\narchitectural perspective: furniture pieces, medical devices and building components. In this regards it\nwas relatively easy to dismiss resolving larger scale componentizations and assemblies in favor of smaller\nscale heterogeneity and distribution. However, when applied to the design of buildings, new challenges\npresent themselves as walls join their respective floors and ceilings, if indeed they must. Throughout this\ntreatise I have expressed the desire to consider all of a building’s components as continuous site-specific\nextensions of a given material logic. Indeed, the main questions raised by this research have typically\nrevolved around the desire to translate bottom-up formation processes across multiple length scales such\nthat an organizational consistency between micro, meso and macro scale (i.e. the case of bone) prevails.\nIn his Conversations with Students, Kahn calls upon us to “consider the momentous event in architecture\nwhen the wall parted and the column became”(Kahn 1998). Natural Design proposes that such an “event”\nis synonymous with formation triggered by environmental constraints. In this regard the distinction\nbetween “wall” and “column” is attributed to the variation of forces their magnitudes and directions as\nmatter (however this matter may be physically defined) distributes itself locally to account for the load\npresented to it. In the future, such typological classes will be omitted from an architect’s glossary and in\ntheir place will appear classes of procedural routines by which to relate material substance to energy. A\ntime will come where buildings may be constructed as bones.\n\nCurrent Limitations 301\n\n9.5.3\n\nNature Minus Growth: Considering Static and Dynamic Material Architectures\n\nMotivated by the idea that architectural form may be generated by the interaction between matter and\nenergy, it is rather straightforward to imagine how concepts developed in this thesis may potentially be\napplied to dynamic objects that respond and adapt to their environment in real time. However, since\nthe subject of this investigation focused on form-generation processes that are informed by material\nproperties and behavior prior to form’s materialization, I have chosen to focus on the generation of static\nobjects and explore these emerging forms as templates of their environment. Another motivation has\nbeen the desire to examine natural materials specifically cellular solids and the way in which their\nmicro and meso-structural organizations have been informed by load and other constraints. This has\nmade it possible to circumvent domains of kinetic structures activated by add-on electronic devices and\nto focus on natural processes, structures and materials.\nClearly, the question of how to convert and implement some of these ideas in the context of what is today\ntermed responsive environments appears to be a promising and challenging path for the future.\n9.6\n9.6.1\n\nDesign Implications\nThe Death of the Module: Design without Assemblies\n\nThe modernist tradition typically promoted the division of functions implicit in the architectural elements: their pre-assigned forms, structures and materials (i.e. the separation between structure and\nfaçade and the assignment of steel columns and glass walls respectively to each function). Coupled with\nautomation in construction, this logic gave birth to an architecture that is easily mass produced, assembled and built of replicated modules. Despite its obvious advantages, the application of the modular logic\nof building holds some fundamental limitations when it considering requirements driven by site-specific\nfunctionality and customization.\nAlternatively, design based upon performance and conditions of habitation promotes customization\nthrough formal, structural and material heterogeneity. Our ability to quantify a building’s structural\nand environmental performance allows the designer to account for site-specific differences of use and\nbehavior.\nGiven such ability to predict and respond to performance criteria and desired effects, this research holds\nimplications for shifting design practice from homogeneous modular design driven by the logic of material assembly to heterogeneous differentiated design driven by material distribution. In this approach,\nmatter is distributed where needed responding to its structural, environmental or, indeed, social performance. In fostering material integration of architectural elements across various scales, architectural\nelements such as structure and façade are no longer divorced in function and/or behavior, but rather\nnegotiated through the informed distribution of matter.\nPerhaps the most significant consequence of design that is informed by performance is the incorporation of difference: gradients of structural and material effects emerge modulating their thickness, transparency, porosity and thermal absorption according to their assigned function or desired condition of\nstability (structure) and comfort (environmental conditions).\n9.6.2\n\nModeling is Analysis is Fabrication: Design without Representation\n\nTo dream that a desert house may form itself from sand as defined by the forces of the wind, or that\nan igloo may self-assemble as arctic water freezes would require that we achieve seamless integration\nbetween processes of environmental surveillance, modeling and construction.\n\n302 CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nThe design world has forever negotiated between the separated practices of form-generation, analysis\nand fabrication. This schism between the design and engineering disciplines (as well as their respective\ntools and technologies) has yielded with it an image of a layered and streamlined practice where time\nand matter are wasted as we move through many layers of design translation from conception to materialization. We have seen that in Nature such distinctions do not exist: the form of an organism is directly\ninformed by its growing substance and the way in which it responds to its environment. As far out a\nstatement as this may seem to be, I have attempted to present some concepts and methods by which such\nintegration between process domains might be achieved as we design structures that are more efficient\nand effective with regards to the functions they are intended to satisfy.\nSupported by the body of work entitled Material-based Design Computation, this research calls for a\nshift from a geometric-centric approach to form generation (dominated by the hierarchy of modeling,\nanalysis and fabrication) to material-based processes (where procedural hierarchies are non-hierarchical\nand context-specific). Such a shift entails that we account for and include material properties and behavior prior to the premeditated and environmentally irresponsible commitments to form.\n9.6.3\n\nSustainable Fabrication: Design without Waste\n\nThe integration between the natural and the artificial environment is not trivial inasmuch as it is desirable.\nThe general view within the construction industry is that given its pervasive nature it is almost impossible\nto imagine a sustainable construction industry without the absence of automation and the prevalence of\nthe vernacular. This is understandable considering that both globally and in the United States of America\n(USA), the construction industry is one of the main contributors to the depletion of natural resources\nand a major cause of unwanted side effects such as air and water pollution, solid waste, deforestation,\ntoxic wastes, health hazards, global warming, and other negative consequences. Although this view is\nchanging with the growing understanding of how important and indeed instrumental natural phenomena\nare or could be in an industrialized society, the utilization of environmental gains in building-construction\nautomation has been hampered by the absence of a detailed understanding of natural phenomena, as well\nas the ability to experimentally implement it in design.\nInitially aimed at reducing material waste, enhancing structural efficiency and minimizing overall environmental impact Variable-Property Rapid Prototyping is currently being developed and implemented as\na design technology innovation, re-thinking the relation between fabrication and ecology, by offering a\nnovel design fabrication technology that is able to produce lightweight materials with continuously varying mechanical properties. This technology offers to significantly reduce material and energy waste in the\ndesign of products and buildings by constructing structures with varied properties using lighter, stronger\nmaterials and avoiding redundant deposition. The aim is that such products and building envelopes will\nbe designed to use significantly less fossil fuel energy to construct and operate than they would typically consume. Local assignment of materials promotes lower energy usage in buildings, blockage of\nradiation heat from sunlight, passive ventilation, improved occupant comfort, and space utilization. In\nthe design of products such strategies promote high levels of customization. The fundamental concept\nis a first-generation rapid manufacturing tool for depositing material with gradually varying physical\nproperties such as density or elasticity per unit volume informed by structural and environmental fitness\nconstraints.\nFinally, the awareness of environmental impacts is growing and many movements seeking to address\nsustainability concerns are gaining momentum. Since buildings represent more than 50 percent of the\nnation’s wealth in the USA, it is imperative that we consider how the principles of Natural Design might\nbe incorporated not only in the design of products but also in the design of fabrication and construction processes. VPRP represents a pilot project in this direction in hope that many such efforts may be\n\nDesign Implications 303\n\nembraced, promoted and implemented as we practice a more natural approach to the design of environments.\n9.7\n\nSummary: Material-based Design Computation and the Open Boundary\n\nThe major objective in establishing the conceptual and theoretical foundations of Material-based Design\nComputation (MDC) has been to establish an approach to the design of computational environments\nwhich might inculcate material attributes directly into the process of computationally supported design,\nduring its various stages. As we have stated, the huge recent advances of more than a decade’s development in computationally supported design have been geometric-centric in nature. This has propagated\na dichotomy of form-making and a posteriori materialization which has become schismatic. MDC has\nbeen envisioned as a body of theory, methods, techniques and technologies which might enable computing directly with material attributes in processes of design synthesis, that is, in the generation of form.\nAs a basic assumption of the research I have attempted to frame MDC as a performance-based model\nof design. In recognition of the various important precedents for formulating models of design, I have\nattempted to emulate Nature’s Way in theorizing and developing computational means for supporting\nmaterial-based form finding and generation. In the most concise sense, the definition, theorizing, experimentation and validation of these research assumptions have done much towards the more ambitious\ngoal of establishing the field. But I believe that these ambitions, when coupled with the technological developments that have been invented as the fruitful side effects of the experimental method of the research\nperhaps justify the claim to having invented and established a new field.\nBeyond the direct scientific contributions of MDC there has been an intrinsic belief that MDC, being framed within the principles of Nature-emulated models of design, might potentially provide the\nattributes of nature in eco-efficiency and sustainability. Thus MDC was intentionally conceived as a\ndesign medium to achieve what I have termed Natural Design. A material-based design approach to\nform-generation deriving from the potential of the design paradigm and technology of gradated, or gradient, materiality is the second area of contribution of the work. Partially realized in the case studies,\nvalidation of these methods of design and their attributes at architectural scales remain to be strengthened in future work. Having said this, the combination of MDC and its attributes in contributing a design\nmethod to produce Natural Design may potentially be considered a new paradigm of design relevant to\na variety of fields including architecture, product design, and the less conventional, but as yet undefined,\nfutures of material design. MDC as a paradigm of Natural Design can provide a second nature, or a\nmeans to envision design (the science of the artificial) as natural artifice.\nAlong the way, among the most significant of the three areas of contributions, was the dissolution of\ndisciplinary boundaries, or the foundation of a meaningful open boundary between architecture, design\nstudies, design computation, and material science. The open boundary condition between these fields\ngrants the discussion of future research and potential contributions of the field a special importance due\nto the scientific and applicative potential of certain of these inter-disciplinary relationships. But then\nagain, such is the nature of design innovation.\n\n304 CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nSERGE\nPromise me, Julia...build.
