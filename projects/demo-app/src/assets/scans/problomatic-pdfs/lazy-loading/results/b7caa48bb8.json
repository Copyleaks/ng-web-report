assigned after the creation of a 3d form in order to fulfill certain structural and aesthetic requirements. In this linear process, material and structure are treated as disintegrated constituents of the design object. This tradition, that typically employs a homogeneous material distribution, advocates the division of form, structure, and materials.\nThe availability of increasingly advanced computational tools initiated new processes that allow computational simulation of material distribution based on applied forces. Design process will depart from the traditional linear path to propagate into deeper ecology with degrees of autonomy that provide complex feedbacks. Objects and systems are not anymore simple assemblages of static parts with applied materials, but are generated from interrelations of manifold of forces and material properties. The designer role has thus been shifted from merely using tools to construct a 3d model, to establishing a loop dialogue with their creative and autonomous possibilities.\nMaterialize workshop aims to explore the relationship between form generation, materials, and applied forces. This process, that is referred to as topological optimisation, seeks to optimise material distribution within a certain boundary condition. It thus entails a shift from traditional form finding techniques to processes of a generative and performative nature by assuming a seamless integration of geometry, material, and performance.\nWe will be exploring matter and agents behavior through Grasshopper (with Millipede, Anemone and Cocoon plugins), interrogating the aesthetic potential of Topological Optimization and Multi-Agent Systems to generate material-driven adaptive structures.  This workshop will introduce the starting knowledge for further research on the subject of materiality as a design input that informs form generation. We will be following up on this subject in future workshops,  and towards building a full scale installation of an adaptive structure next year that integrates matter with geometry and fabrication logic.\nThis workshop will be a gateway for further research on the subject of materiality as a design strategy that informs form generation. We will be conducting further research on the subject in future workshops and towards building a full scale installation of an adaptive structure that integrates matter with geometry and fabrication logic.// Learning Objectives:\nThe workshop objective is to develop a design sensibility based on material topological optimization that is driven by a negotiation between matter and applied forces to generate material-driven adaptive structure. \nSet in a real design environment, the workshops will explore:\n Application of the new techniques to reconfigure matter distribution based on applied forces on a variety of scales - from furniture to building scale.\nGeneration and optimization of advanced mesh modeling techniques that will translate the generated geometry from mere computer representation into physical formations through the on-going generation of 3d printing models.\nCalibration of multiple streams of data in order to develop design sensibility for the generation of material-driven adaptive structures, and potentially serve to extend the range of our perceptive spectrum.\nIntroducing Agents-based system to generate behaviors that are guided towards the generation of Topologically Optimized forms.\n 3d printing file settings and printing techniques.\n\n\n// Methodology\nWe will be spending the first 2.5 days exploring the tools and the different techniques of working with Millipede plug-in to generate mesh-based optimized structures and to explore its potential to inform material-based design process. We will also be exploring agents-based systems to inform the generation of topologically optimized forms of a variety of scales. Topological optimization will be achieved in response to the selected manifold of applied forces and the selected methodology. In the evening of the third day we will introduce participants to the techniques and methodologies to prepare their model for the 3d Printer. We will learn how to prepare the Gh/Rhino file and set the relevant parameters of the model to be ready for 3d printing. We will also explore the potential and limitations of the current 3d printing technology. \n \n// Design Exercise\nIn the afternoon of the third day, participants will be divided into groups to develop their own concept. The design intent will be focused on the process of generating topologically optimized complex systems from the embodiment of different forces. Participants will test the application of different methodologies to generate a variety of artefacts that reflect the groups' concepts. \n In addition to the technical part, the workshop will also include lectures on the subject by Andrea Graziano, and Zayad Motlib. \n //  Daily Schedule\nWill be announced soon. \n// Software &amp; skills:\nBasic modeling skill in Rhino, and intermediate to advanced level in Grasshopper are required.

 <p></p>\n<h1><strong><em><span style=\"font-size:16.0pt\">MATERIALIZE</span></em></strong><br>\n<span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">Topological Optimization Workshop</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">Dubai, Jan. 27 - 30, 2016</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">// Abstract</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">In traditional design processes, materials are typically assigned after the creation of a 3d form in order to fulfill certain structural and aesthetic requirements. In this linear process, material and structure are treated as disintegrated constituents of the design object. This tradition, that typically employs a homogeneous material distribution, advocates the division of form, structure, and materials.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">The availability of increasingly advanced computational tools initiated new processes that allow computational simulation of material distribution based on applied forces. Design process will depart from the traditional linear path to propagate into deeper ecology with degrees of autonomy that provide complex feedbacks. Objects and systems are not anymore simple assemblages of static parts with applied materials, but are generated from interrelations of manifold of forces and material properties. The designer role has thus been shifted from merely using tools to construct a 3d model, to establishing a loop dialogue with their creative and autonomous possibilities.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><strong>Materialize</strong> </span></em><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">workshop aims to explore the relationship between form generation, materials, and applied forces. This process, that is referred to as topological optimisation, seeks to optimise material distribution within a certain boundary condition. It thus entails a shift from traditional form finding techniques to processes of a generative and performative nature by assuming a seamless integration of geometry, material, and performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">We will be exploring matter and agents behavior through Grasshopper (with Millipede, Anemone and Cocoon plugins), interrogating the aesthetic potential of Topological Optimization and Multi-Agent Systems to generate material-driven adaptive structures.  <em>This workshop will introduce the starting knowledge for further research on the subject of materiality as a design input that informs form generation. We will be following up on this subject in future workshops,  and towards building a full scale installation of an adaptive structure next year that integrates matter with geometry and fabrication logic.</em></span></p>\n<blockquote><em><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">This workshop will be a gateway for further research on the subject of materiality as a design strategy that informs form generation. We will be conducting further research on the subject in future workshops and towards building a full scale installation of an adaptive structure that integrates matter with geometry and fabrication logic.</span></em></blockquote><p><strong><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">// Learning Objectives:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">The workshop objective is to develop a design sensibility based on material topological optimization that is driven by a negotiation between matter and applied forces to generate material-driven adaptive structure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">Set in a real design environment, the workshops will explore:</span></span></p>\n<ul><li><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:7pt\"> </span></span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">Application of the new techniques to reconfigure matter distribution based on applied forces on a variety of scales - from furniture to building scale.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">Generation and optimization of advanced mesh modeling techniques that will translate the generated geometry from mere computer representation into physical formations through the on-going generation of 3d printing models.</span></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">Calibration of multiple streams of data in order to develop design sensibility for the generation of material-driven adaptive structures, and potentially serve to extend the range of our </span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">perceptive spectrum.</span></span></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">Introducing Agents-based system to generate behaviors that are guided towards the generation of Topologically Optimized forms.</span></span></span></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:7pt\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">3d printing file settings and printing techniques.</span></span></span></span></span></li>\n</ul><p style=\"margin-left:.5in\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><br>\n</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">// Methodology</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">We will be spending the first 2.5 days exploring the tools and the different techniques of working with Millipede plug-in to generate mesh-based optimized structures and to explore its potential to inform material-based design process. We will also be exploring agents-based systems to inform the generation of topologically optimized forms of a variety of scales. Topological optimization will be achieved in response to the selected manifold of applied forces and the selected methodology. In the evening of the third day we will introduce participants to the techniques and methodologies to prepare their model for the 3d Printer. We will learn how to prepare the Gh/Rhino file and set the relevant parameters of the model to be ready for 3d printing. We will also explore the potential and limitations of the current 3d printing technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">// Design Exercise</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">In the afternoon of the third day, participants will be divided into groups to develop their own concept. The design intent will be focused on the process of generating topologically optimized complex systems from the embodiment of different forces. Participants will test the application of different methodologies to generate a variety of artefacts that reflect the groups' concepts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"> In addition to the technical part, the workshop will also include lectures on the subject by Andrea Graziano, and Zayad Motlib. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"> <strong>//  Daily Schedule</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">Will be announced soon. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><strong>// Software &amp; skills:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\">Basic modeling skill in Rhino, and intermediate to advanced level in Grasshopper are required.
