Contrarily, in the natural world shape and\nmatter are structured through growth and adaptation, resulting in highly tunable and hierarchically\nstructured constructs, which exhibit excellent mechanical properties. Working towards integration,\nrigorous bottom-up natural material studies have resulted in a novel multi-scale digital design and\nfabrication platform that is precisely tailored, viable, and a rich companion to develop sustainable explorations across application scales integrating shape and matter control. Specifically, the\nresearch introduces design and environmental motivations driving novel sustainable digital manufacturing of water-based biomaterial structures at the architectural, and product-scale. Water is\nharnessed to tune biomaterial properties, to guide shape formation by natural evaporation, and to\nfully recycle and reuse material structures. Initial outcomes demonstrate self-supporting structural\nconstructs displaying multi-functionality informed by graded material properties and hierarchical\ndistribution depositions. I discuss contemporary literature in water-based manufacturing, and detail\nmethods of the novel additive fabrication platform that combines a robotic positioning system and\ncustomized multi-barrel deposition system. Important contributions of the platform development as\na design companion serve to advance sustainable digital manufacturing and propel it towards biologically inspired and material-informed techniques. Integrated material-based design studies, novel\ntechnology development, and sustainable motivation, produce an invention that outputs functional\nbiodegradable products, reduces the need for external energy sources for fabrication, operates at\nroom temperature, uses mild chemicals, and could embed productive microorganism cultures due to\nthe biocompatibility of the materials used, pointing towards new possibilities for digital fabrication\nof living materials. Finally, the work advocates for the designer to play the role of a cohesive thinker,\nas well as a rigorous science and aesthetics explorer, able to seed novel processes that emerge from\nmaterial studies towards digital design and advanced fabrication.\nKeywords: new design companions; material-driven design; additive manufacturing; water-based\ndigital fabrication; bio-materials catalogue; environmental engineering; architectural design; product design; biological design;\nThesis Supervisor: Neri Oxman\nTitle: Associate Professor of Media Arts and Sciences\n\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication:\nMaterial, Product, and Architectural Explorations\nin Printing Chitosan and its Composites\nby\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\n\nSignature redacted\nKatia B ertoldi.....................................................................\nAssociate Professor of the Natural Sciences,\nDirector Bertoldi Group, Harvard University, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences\nThesis Reader\n\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication:\nMaterial, Product, and Architectural Explorations\nin Printing Chitosan and its Composites\nby\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\n\nSignature redacted\n..............................................\nAssociate Professor of Media Arts and Sciences,\nDirector Synthetic Neurobiology Group, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nThesis Reader\n\nE dw ard B oyden ......\n\n....\n\n....\n\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication:\nMaterial, Product, and Architectural Explorations\nin Printing Chitosan and its Composites\nby\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\n\nSignature redacted\nNeil G ershenfeld...\n\n.............................\n\nProfessor of Media Arts and Sciences,\nDirector Center for Bits and Atoms, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nThesis Reader\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis thesis is dedicated to my wonderful parents and to my life and work partner, Jorge Duro Royo,\nfor his constant, generous and wise support, and his always challenging motivation.

Chapter\n2 discusses contemporary literature in the role of water-based materials and processes in biology\nand manufacturing. The core of this document, Chapter 3, proposes a novel water-based fabrication\nplatform and supports the approach by detailing methods and results. The last chapter, Chapter 4,\nconcludes with an analysis of the thesis contributions and perspectives for future work.\n\n1.1\n\nResearch Motivations\n\nThis thesis is motivated by architectural design and environmental engineering and falls at the intersection of bio-materials science, robotic digital fabrication, and material-informed computational\nmodeling. I will investigate how water and water-based materials can be used in digital fabrication\nto internally organize, manufacture, and recycle structured objects and architectural parts.\n\n1.1.1\n\nArchitectural: Manufacturing Designs\n\nWhile contemporary digital fabrication tools are able to produce geometrically sophisticated objects\nand structures, such constructs are typically not sustainable insofar as material and energy use are\nconsidered (Oxman et al. [2012]). In contrast, assembly observed in nature employs mild chemicals, produces little to no waste, and uses small amounts of energy to produce multi-functional and\nadaptable systems (Vincent [2012]).\nWater exists throughout nature and in all biological materials(Wiggins [1990]). It provides for an\ninvisible scaffold designed to assemble basic molecules into structures with complex functions and\nproperty gradients. Examples include the giant squid beak where water content contributes to a\nsignificant stiffness gradient (Dumitriu [2004], Vincent [2012], Miserez et al. [2008]). The squid's\nbeak is one of the hardest and stiffest wholly organic materials known. Water-storing proteins,\n\n15\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nCH3\nNH\n\nOH\n\nHO\n\nOH\n\noH\n\nOH\n\nO\n\ndOWMOy p\n\nn\n\nI\n\n/Mg\n\nYOUNGS MODULUS E4OPpI\n\nDE T0\n\n(M.1CPM\n\n'I\n\n0/001\n\n001\n\n003\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n51\n\n0\n\n..\n31\n\n10\n\nd.~n~itYPp/M8 111\n\nFigure 1-1: Structuralpolysaccharides such as chitin and cellulose are very abundant in nature. Cellulose provides\nstructurefor plants and its most pure form is the cotton flower Chitin supports the exoskeleton of insects and crustaceans.\nThe elastic moduli and tensile strength of chitin and cellulose are similar to those of engineeringceramics and metal\n\nalloys.\n\nand polymers are carefully combined to generate its internal structure contributing to exceptionally\ngraded material properties. When hydrated the beak exhibits an extreme functional gradient across\nits structure: it is sharp and firm at the tip with a tensile strength of 35MPa, and 10 times more\ncompliant at the rim with a tensile strength of 3.5MPa (Miserez et al. [2008]). Another example\nof water-mediated structural performance is the chitin-made insect cuticles and crustacean shells.\nThese structures accomplish dual functionality enabled by variable hydration. Chitin can be found,\nat once, in hard composites that shield insects, and in the flexible tissue found in their joints. Despite\nchitin's extraordinary properties, and in spite of its abundance, it is mostly used in pharmaceutical\nand dietary products (Lieleg and Ribbeck [2011], Dumitriu [2004], Vincent [2012], Rinaudo [2006],\nGutowska et al. [2001]), and has not yet been deployed in large scale manufacturing of consumer\ngoods (Fernandez and Ingber [2014], Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014]).\nIndeed, water is known to initiate or activate chemical reactions in biological materials and, in the\nengineering disciplines, it is especially relevant in the context of programmable materials (Krieg\nand Menges [2013], Reichert et al. [2015], Tibbits [2014]). Within traditional building construction, water can be found in common construction materials such as clay, concrete or plaster, where\n\n16\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nit also acts as an initiator/activator. Metals and glass too, involve water as a lubricator and cooler\nfor efficient manufacturing. More recently, water-as-activator has been used in programmable composites where hydrophilic polymers, which expand 150 percent when exposed to water, are used at\nthe joints of segmented strands for underwater 2D or 3D shaping processes (Tibbits [2014]). Additionally, recent research demonstrates a new way to utilize wood as a responsive building envelope.\nWood is a hygroscopic material that can absorb water molecules causing it to shrink and swell in\nthe tangential direction of the fibers (Krieg and Menges [2013]). As a result, thin wooden sheets\ncan be induced to find their shape in response to humidity changes when tuning the fiber direction\nin the exposed components (Krieg and Menges [2013], Reichert et al. [2015]). Common to all of\nthese examples is the use of water as an agent for material processing and object shape change. This\nis contrary to its use in the biological world as a building block for internal organization, environmental tunability and biodegradability.\n\n1.1.2\n\nEnvironmental: Engineering Sustainability\n\nMan-made plastics are challenging to reuse or degrade (US Environmental Protection [2013]). Only\nabout 9% of plastic waste generated in the US is recyclable, while 27% of glass, 34% of metal, and\n65% of cardboard are routinely recycled (US Environmental Protection [2013]). In the construction industry, synthetic plastics derived from petrochemicals are vastly used and make up most of\npollutant non-recyclable waste (US Environmental Protection [2013]). While it could provide an\nalternative to fuel-based plastic materials, the use of regenerated bio-materials for product, architectural, and engineering applications is still not widespread (Fernandez and Ingber [2014]). This low\nuse rate exists in spite of the fact that natural materials display exceptional mechanical properties\n(Fernandez and Ingber [2014, 2013], Gibson and Ashby [1997]). Cellulose provides structure for\nplants, and chitin supports the exoskeleton of insects and crustaceans (Dumitriu [2004], Vincent\n[2012]). The elastic moduli and tensile strength of structural polysaccharides such as chitin and\ncellulose are similar to those of engineering ceramics and metal alloys (Gibson and Ashby [1997])\n(Figure 1-1).\nNatural materials, and specifically polymers and polysaccharides, provide for a vast renewable resource produced at much higher rates than man-made synthetic polymers (Figure 1-2).\n\nConse-\n\nquently, polysaccharide derivatives could replace existing synthetic fuel-based polymers, provide\nnew property combinations for relevant applications, and play a key role in future manufacturing\nimplementations (Dumitriu [2004], Gibson and Ashby [1997]).\n\n1.2\n\nIntended Contributions\n\n1.2.1\n\nTheoretical: New Design Companions\n\nBiological structures adapt to external stimuli by growth-induced material property variation resulting in hierarchically structured forms.

Design driven by material behavior - such as digitally fabricated internal structures\ninformed by load-responsive arrangements as can be found in the biological world - can help and\nconsequent matter tuning by digital design and reconnect conceptualization and materialization of\ncontemporary complex designs. I believe that such practices will enable a shift of both mindset and\ntools from geometry-centric design processes to material-centric approaches in digital design and\nfabrication.\n\n1.2.2\n\nApplied: Water-Based Fabrication Research\n\nIn this thesis I demonstrate an applied case study of Material Studies as New Design Companions\nsurveying the methods and results of bottom-up material-driven design. Specifically in my work on\n\n18\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nWater-Based Fabrication Research focused on the exploration of water as a fundamental material\nbuilding block able to unravel novel aesthetics as well as extraordinary structural performance via\nadditive fabrication of natural composites. Specifically, I use water as; (1) an initiation agent, to\nchemically formulate the composite solution; (2) an activation agent, achieving optimal viscosity\nand \"fabricability\" properties; (3) a shape formation agent via natural evaporation; (4) a recycling\nagent for the reuse of the deposited materials; and (5) a life sustaining agent, enabling the containment of living micro-organisms for biological augmentation. My research lies at the intersection\nof bio-materials science, digital design and additive manufacturing. I present a platform and its\nassociated methods for the design and production of small to large-scale multifunctional constructs\nthat have the capacity to interact with their environment and that are fully recyclable upon contact\nwith water.\n\n19\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\n20\n\nChapter 2\n\nBackground\n2.1\n\nThe Role of Matter\n\nIn the natural world shape results from bottom-up material organization, sophisticated property gradation and functional hierarchies developed over time within single material systems (Vincent et al.\n[2006], Vincent [2012]). As a result, natural structures such as bamboo, silk, or bone, display extraordinary properties. Gaining deeper insight into, and a better understanding of, the formation\nprocesses associated with these natural phenomena would greatly benefit the design of digital fabrication tools and technologies (Gibson and Ashby [1997], Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014]).\n\n2.1.1\n\nMatter & Biological Design\n\nStructures in nature are shaped according to the principles of minimum inventory for maximum\ndiversity (Pearce [1990]). Organisms use freely available energy, simple molecular chemistry, mild\nchemicals, and abundant resources to build complex medium-, and large-scale structures, such as\nbird's nests or termite mounts (Pearce [1990], Vincent [2012]). Biological structures are locally\nattuned and responsive, resilient to disturbances, and fully recyclable (Vincent [2012]). Most biomaterial structures are generated at ambient conditions with low energy and using water (Vincent\n[2012], Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014]).\n\n2.1.2\n\nMatter & Manufacturing Design\n\nCurrent design practice is characterized by the domination of shape over matter. Consequently, virtual shape-defining parameters are typically prioritized over physical material and fabrication constraints, which are often considered only in hindsight, following a geometric-centric design phase\n(Menges [2007], Oxman [2011], Marenko [2014]). Recent advances in direct digital manufacturing\nare enabling a shift from a geometry-centric to a material-centric design practice (Oxman [2011],\nSabin [2013], Duro-Royo et al. [2014b]). Today, designers have access to highly sophisticated\ncomputer-aided fabrication hardware that is contributing to the development of new material-driven\n\n21\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\ndesign processes (Nicholas and Tamke [2012], Cabrinha [2008], Krieg and Menges [2013], DuroRoyo et al. [2014b]). As the two domains - the physical and the digital - interact during the early\nstages of form generation, new and unexpected structural and morphological potentials may emerge\nthat approach natural morphogenesis increasing efficiency and augmenting performance (Menges\n[2007], Ramsgaard Thomsen et al. [2012], Marenko [2014]).\n\n2.2\n\nThe Role of Water\n\nThe role of water in the human body, and in a large number of natural processes, is essential to\nnatural growth and shaping. Consequently, soft matter is assuming a growing role in fundamental\nscience and in technological applications. Soft materials can rarely be understood on one length and\ntime scale alone (Peter and Kremer [2010]), and their transition into solids by water evaporation\nentails a fascinating change in internal organization. Time-based multi-scale manufacturing and\nshaping prediction of water-based bio-materials needs further research.\n\n2.2.1\n\nWater & Biological Design\n\nWater exists in all biological materials. It provides an invisible structure driven by the interaction\nof intrinsic chemistry and the external environment. Water assembles basic molecules into structures with complex functions and property gradients such as the one found in the beak of the giant\nsquid, where the water content contributes to a stiffness gradient (Dumitriu [2004], Vincent [2012],\nMiserez et al. [2008]). The squid's beak is one of the hardest and stiffest wholly organic materials\nknown, and in its internal structure, water, proteins, and polymers are carefully combined to generate exceptional material properties. Once hydrated, this material system exhibits extreme degrees\nof property differentiation across its structure: it is sharp and firm at the tip, and soft and adaptable\n\nat the rim (Miserez et al. [2008]).\nAnother example of water-mediated performance is the chitin-based material system that composes\ninsect cuticle and crustacean shells. It accomplishes a dual function enabled by differential hydration. Chitin makes both the hard composite material that shields insects, and the flexible tissue in\ntheir joints. Interestingly, despite chitin's extraordinary properties, and it being the most abundant\norganic compound on earth after cellulose, it is not yet used in manufacturing of consumer products\n(Fernandez and Ingber [2014], Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014]). I intend to advance research in this\ndirection.\nThe interaction of water with the polar chemistry of biological surfaces, wether inside or outside\nthe cell, is the primary driver of mechanical and morphological properties (Vincent [2012]). The\naqueous extracellular matrix of cells surrounds tissues and organs and provides mechanical support\nand regulation of survival, migration and differentiation. Two types of extracellular macromolecules\ncompose the matrix (Katharina Ribbeck, personal communication, Fall 2014, MIT). Biological hydrogels are networks of protein-polysaccharide chains that typically contain 90-99% water. They\nsurround biological functional entities such as cells, tissues, organs, or entire organisms. These gels\n22\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nChitin\n\nChitosan\n\nFormula: C16H28N201 i.ICSH13NO51n\nClassification: Hexosamines.

Chitin can be made water soluble\nby deacetylizing it into chitosan that can be transformed into gels thatform strongfilms by naturalwater evaporation.\n\ncan cover a wide spectrum of material properties, ranging from relatively soft and viscous-like to\nhighly elastic (Lieleg and Ribbeck [2011]). Biological hydrogels establish and regulate the mechanical properties of cells and tissues and and serve as lubricants in joints or on epithelial surfaces\n(Lieleg and Ribbeck [2011]). However, the physiological role of biological gels is not limited to\ntheir mechanical performance. They can also form selective barriers that control the exchange of\nmolecules between different compartments (Lieleg and Ribbeck [2011]).\nFor instance in the human body, water performs a manifold of crucial functions. It maintains the\nhealth and integrity of every cell, keeps the bloodstream flowing through blood vessels, helps eliminate the byproducts of metabolism such as excess electrolytes and urea, it regulates body temperature through sweat, moistens mucous membranes such as those of the lungs and mouth, lubricates\nand cushion joints, reduces the risk of cystitis by keeping the bladder clear of bacteria, aids digestion and prevents constipation, moisturizes the skin to maintain its texture and appearance, carries\nnutrients and oxygen to cells, serves as a shock absorber inside the eyes, spinal cord and in the\namniotic sac surrounding the fetus in pregnancy (Wiggins [1990]).\nWater typically makes up from 80 to 95% of the mass of growing plant tissues. Cell walls allow the\nbuild up of water-induced turgor pressure within each cell that contributes to rigidity and mechanical stability of non-woody plant tissue, and is essential for many physiological processes including\ncell enlargement, gas exchange in the leaves, or transport of nutrients. Long-distance water movement is crucial to the survival of land plants (Raven et al. [2005]). Turgor pressure also enables\nanother interesting phenomena; water-based actuation. The movement occurs when regions of cells\nlose pressure. When the plant is disturbed, sections on the stems are stimulated to release chemicals\nwhich force water out of the cell vacuoles and diffuse it out of the cells, producing a loss of cell\n\n23\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nNANO tissue scaffolds\n\nMICRO drug deUvery\n\nMESO single-use consumabLes\n\nMACRO water-based digital fabircation\n\n5mm\n\nFigure 2-2: The properties of chitosan and otherpolysaccharidesallowfor the development of advanced materials used\nin in multiple scale products.\n\npressure and collapse (Raven et al. [2005]).\n\n2.2.2\n\nWater & Manufacturing Design\n\nFor the past decade, manufacturing of hydrogels has become a rapidly evolving technique to produce nano-featured biocompatible tissue scaffolds for tissue engineering purposes (Li et al. [2005],\nGutowska et al. [2001], Melchels et al. [2012]). There are mainly three different bio-fabrication\ntechniques known to achieve fully interconnected soft-material 3D structures: laser-based, nozzlebased (also known as robotic dispensing) and printer-based systems (also known as inkjet printing) (Billiet et al. [2012], Malda et al. [2013]).\n\nThe fabrication of hydrogel scaffolds requires\n\nmild processing conditions. Therefore, additive-manufacturing techniques such as fused deposition modeling (FDM) or selective laser sintering (SLS) cannot be used as they generally involve\nharsh processing conditions (Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014], Fernandez and Ingber [2014]).\nRecent research in tissue engineering proves that biodegradable scaffolds from chitosan (Figure 2-1)\n- deacetylized chitin from ground shrimp shells, a by-product of the fishing industry - and sodium\nalginate - a gum extracted from the cell walls of abundant brown algae - show significantly improved mechanical and biological properties (Li et al. [2005]). Moreover, it has been shown that\nchitosan enables the manufacturing of medium three-dimensional (3-D) objects, thereby offering a\nnew pathway for large-scale production of fully compostable engineered components with complex\nforms.\nRecent developments deploy conventional manufacturing methods such as injection casting into\nepoxy resin molds to produce chitosan-based functional 3D industrial products, such as fully compostable cups and egg storing containers (Fernandez and Ingber [2014, 2013], Rinaudo [2006]). The\nnon-toxicity, water solubility, capacity for swelling, and chemical versatility of chitosan allows for\nthe development of advanced functionalized materials that can be used in multiple scales such as\n\n24\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nin drug delivery, tissue scaffolding, consumer products or large scale architectural parts (Figure 22) (Mogas-Soldevila et al.

I am interested in researching low-energy and mild-condition deposition systems in\norder to design large-scale functionally graded structures with environmental capabilities for\napplications in architectural and product design.\n\n25\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\n26\n\nChapter 3\n\nProposal\n3.1\n\nNew Design Companions\n\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication research serves here as a case study positioned at the\nintersection of bio-inspired formation, material science, sustainable design and digital fabrication.\nIt belongs to a stream of thought and practice that engages emerging technical material explorations\nin the design world. I envision New Design Companions as a novel way of legislating laws for\na material-based design exploration seeding the production of new technologies and with product\nresults that cannot be a-priori imagined (Figure 3-1).\nDriven by aqueous material formation, in Water-based Digital Design and Fabrication research, a\nnovel robotically controlled system is developed to deposit natural water-based organic structures\nat ambient conditions, using mild chemicals and low amounts of energy (Duro-Royo et al. [2015],\nMogas-Soldevila and Oxman [2015]). It additively manufactures biodegradable and lightweight\ncomposite constructs with functional, mechanical, and optical gradients across length scales (DuroRoyo et al. [2015], Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014, 2015a]).\n\n3.1.1\n\nWater-based Design Research\n\nNovel bio-materials design and natural aqueous formation offer in Water-based Design Research a\nnew structural design perspective combining a crustacean-derived biopolymer with robotic fabrication to shape constructs that interact with the environment utilizing graded material properties for\nhydration-guided formation (Figure 3-2).\nStructural, manufacturing, and environmental design templating strategies are established informing\nthe design of constructs and their material makeup. Biomaterial-driven design process are presented\nhere resulting in a novel structural system and a custom robotic manufacturing platform designed to\ndeposit water-based composites unveiling novel functional, mechanical, and optical gradients across\nlength scales. Components are form-found through evaporation patterns informed by the geometrical arrangement of structural members and the hierarchical distribution of material properties. Each\ncomponent is designed to take shape upon contact with air and dissolve upon contact with water.\n27\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nform fabricated\nFigure 3-1: Close-up back andfront images of a 3m-long hierarchicallystructuredbio-plastic column\nmanufacturing\nadditive\nrobotic\nnovel\na\nwith\ndesign\ndigital\nintegrating\nworkflow\ncomputational\nmaterial-driven\na\nusing\nplatform.\nBelow are shown the principles and method applied as a unique case demonstrating the material\necology design approach through additive manufacturing of lightweight, biocompatible and materially heterogeneous structures.

By implementing a low-operation energy open-ended extrusion\nsystem the mixtures of diverse materials can be controlled without the need for special formulations\nor specific physical forms such as the ones required by other AM processes including; photo-curing\nresins for SLA (stereolithography), powders or pellets for SLS (selective laser sintering), or filaments for FDM (fused deposition modeling). The large-scale bio-plastic forms produced display\nstructural properties, functional mechanical gradients and material features ranging from micro to\nmacro scale. These structures can be dissolved in water and recycled within minutes. Alternatively\nthey can be chemically stabilized to moisture and utilized to fabricate temporary architectural-components with environmental functionalities such as water storage, hydration-induced shape changes,\nor nutrient release while biodegrading (Mogas-Soldevila et al.

The\ndimensional limits of the process, when using a Kuka Agilus KR1 100, are 1000mm in length and\n500mm in width in order to deposit rectangular constructs. The portable extrusion system can be\nmounted on robotic arms with a larger envelope or other CNC machines. Figure 3-3 demonstrates\nthe mechanical experimental setup (Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014]).\nDimensioning Tests: Key experiments executed in the design of the extrusion system where performed using an Instron mechanical tester and a shear measurement AR-G2 viscometer. From the\ninitial testing, a 60N axial load is required to extrude the colloids from a 200cc syringe with a\n0.7mm nozzle, and a motor torque is calculated for direct drive of 1.8Nm. In terms of travel speed\na maximum robotic arm end-effector displacement of 50mm/s is required in order to ensure proper\nextrusion of the materials (Figure 3-4a, Figure 3-4c). Colloids tested under shear rates of IPa to\n10OPa over 10min display properties that favor extrusion of the material, due in part to the presence\nof the sodium alginate additive in the chitosan matrix [16]. These favorable properties are due to\nthe enhanced shear thinning behavior that sodium alginate provides, where the viscosity of the fluid\ndecreases when the shear stress applied is increased. This change in the properties of the material\n\n31\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nis caused by shear-induced reorganization of the polymer chains to a more stretched conformation, which leads to decreased entanglement. For fabrication purposes, this implies a decreased\nshear stress at the high shear rates that are present inside a nozzle, followed by a sharp increase in\nviscosity upon deposition, facilitating the extrusion and printing fidelity of the viscous matrix [4],\n[16]. Concentration of sodium alginate of 3% w/v is chosen for sample production in Figure 3-4b\n(Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014]).\n\nExperimental Setup:\n1) Existing Motion Platform: The extrusion system is attached to an existing motion platforms\nend-effector, a Kuka Agilus 6-axis robotic arm, in order to take advantage of its high precision displacement and repeatability capabilities.\n2) Extrusion System Design: The extruder design is composed of two chambers utilizing plunger\nactuation for viscous colloids and an additional chamber to handle dry or granular dispensing of\nnatural fillers such as cellulose chopped fibers, fine sand, or natural polymer powders (Figure 3-3c).\nBipolar stepper motors with non-captive lead-screws (Figure 3-4d) linearly advance the materials\nto the tip by pushing the syringe plunger. The motors are mounted to CAD-CAM water-jet cut\naluminum frames that provide hardware support and vertical guides to prevent the lead-screws from\nturning, thereby transmitting the rotor actuation force to linear motion.\n3) Nozzle System Design: The system provides for the nozzles to be custom designed to step the\n8mm reservoir opening down to different diameters and material configurations for extrusion. For\nthe samples presented here 3D-printed single nozzles are designed with an inner diameter of 0.5mm,\n0.7mm, 2mm, 3mm and 4mm that can be mounted at the end tips of other complex nozzles. A three\nparallel chamber nozzle is designed with 2mm final inner diameter, a tri-axial extrusion nozzle with\n3mm final inner diameter, and a three material static mixing nozzle with 3mm final inner diameter.\nNozzle schematics are displayed in Figure 3-5.\n\nControl and Operation: The desired objects are modeled in a computer-aided design platform and\ncustom code is written to slice surface-based geometry into layers, build a line-based tool-path from\ncurves, and stream the tool-path steps to a central interface in the computer. The central interface\ncomputes input and output data from the design platform and to and from the mechanical parts of\nthe system (robotic arm and extrusion stepper motors). Various machine paths are tested and evaluated for extrusion consistency and mechanical extrusion behavior starting with straight lines and\nmoving into cylindrical paths and layered prismatic depositions. The tool-paths are processed and\ntransmitted to the robotic arm via a server socket, and to the motors via serial signal. Both output\nsignals are synchronized for smooth control. The robotic arm sends back actual positions that can\nbe compared with the targets sent for consistent coordinated feed / speed ratios. The interface takes\ninto account forward and reverse motor drive to prevent material dripping. A stepper motor transmission code is developed that receives data from the central interface and sending signals to two\ndriver boards that are set up to run the two-stepper motors simultaneously thereby enabling variable\n\n32\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nFigure 3-5: a) Single nozzle designs and tips. b) Tria.xial and static mixing nozzle designs. c) Continuous extrusion with a\nsingle nozzle with 0.5mmfeature size. d) Parallel material extrusion nozzle depositing colloids mixed with white and black\nfood coloring.

For the motor control hardware a micro-controller board is used\nand bipolar drivers are powered through an external bench power supply at 30 V and 1.6 Amps in\ncorrespondence with the motor specifications. Robotic movement and extrusion are not explicitly\nlinked, which allows for independent control of each motor-driven syringe, and the displacement\nof the robotic arm end-effector. With the ability to vary each of these parameters individually in\nsuccession, there is more flexibility in the development of the tool as an experimental fabrication\nplatform (Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014 ]).\n\nMechanical Assembly: The extrusion system is attached to an existing motion platforms endeffector. The existing platform is a Kuka KR AGILUS robotic arm, model KR 10Rl100 SIXX WP.\nThe platform weighs 54kg with a lOkg payload and a maximum reach of l lOlmm. It has 6 axes, a\n\n< +/ - 0.03mm repeatability and employs the KR C4 compact control system. The stepper motors\nare equipped with non-captive Acme lead-screws with 9.5mm diameter and 635mm length. The\nsingle nozzle assemblies use Oxford Universal plastic pipette tips of a 0.7mm, lmm and 2mm inner\ndiameter at the tip. The complex nozzle fabrication uese the Formlabs Forml SLS (selective laser\nsintering) 3D-printer with clear photo curable resin, 0.5mm layer height, no internal support and\nhigh exterior support density for maximum channel resolution to minimize extrusion calculation\n33\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nspeed to produce\nFigure 3-6: (columns a, b, c). a) A 2x1x0.5cm prism printed using a 0.7mm nozzle at 20mm/s printing\ncolumn. b) A\nbottom\nin\nlens\nmagnifying\naugment\n1.5\na\nunder\nshown\nis\nresult\nThe\norientations.\nlayer\nunidirectional\nThe result is\norientations.\nlayer\n2x1x0.5cm prism printedusing a 0.7mm nozzle at 20mm/s speed to produce bidirectional\ntemperature\nroom\nat\ndissolved\nis\ncomposite\nshaped\ncone\nshown in bottom column. c) A printed 15g dried chitosan-based\n[2014].\nal.\net\nMogas-Soldevila\nfrom\nFigure\nbiodegradability.\ncolloids\ndemonstrating\nin 200ml of water over 20min,\n\nerror due to material friction at the nozzle.

[2014]).\nHardware: A Mastech Linear DC power supply, model 30V 5A HY3005F-3, with triple outputs\nand dual adjustable outputs (0-30V and 0-5A) is used to power two bipolar motor stepper drivers\nMondo Step 4.2, with an output current of IA to 4.2A, a supply voltage of 20VDC to 50VDC and a\nstep frequency of 0 to 300Khz. The bipolar non-captive linear actuators Haydon 57F4A, have a step\nangle of 1.8 degrees, a linear travel per step of 0.0079375mm and a force versus linear velocity of\n1200N at speeds below 1mm/sec.

Using the geometric kernel library of the plugin, custom\n\n34\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nC-sharp code is written to transmit fabrication instructions to the central interface. The central interface is written in C++ using the Eclipse IDE environment (2013 The Eclipse Foundation) which\ncomputes input and output data from the design platform to and from the mechanical parts. Transmission is achieved with an Ethernet UDP socket and via a serial USB signal. The stepper motor\ntransmission code is developed in C code using the cross-platform open-source Arduino IDE (by\nArduino Software) (Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014]).\n\nInitial Results in Layered Depositions: Initial material bonding and flow-rate consistency tests\nwhere performed resulting in simple prisms (Figure 3-5c). Constructed 2xlxO.5cm prisms with\na single nozzle setup, display minimum feature sizes of 0.7mm and 1mm measured with a digital caliper of 0.0254mm accuracy. Unidirectional and bidirectional toolpaths where tested with\nsignificant improvement in layer bonding in the bidirectional samples (Figure 3-6a, Figure 3-6b).\nGeometrically patterned tool-paths with 0.7mm thickness, displaying structural inertia when dried\nand detached from the substrate, where designed in anticipation of future development for object\ninfill (Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014]).\n\nInitial Results in Parallel Depositions: Tests with a three-chamber nozzle (using only 2 material\nchambers) display 2mm feature size when two colloids with different coloration are extruded from\nthe two actuated syringes. Figure 3-5c displays successful parallel extrusion of the materials. This\ninteresting feature could be used in future work to deposit dual material geometries with different\ninternal and external properties. This could avoid boundary de-lamination issues between the two\nmaterials as the colloids are bond together while extruded through the multi-material chamber at\nthe nozzle. All samples are composed of chitosan-alginate matrix and chitin powder aggregate with\nwhite and black food coloring for visual contrast (Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014]).\n\nInitial Results in Graded Depositions: Material mixing at the nozzle provides for mechanical\nproperty variation within the samples, as well as for controlled material gradients with the intention\nof mimicking spatial organization and material composition strategies found in Nature. Figure 3-7a\ndisplays the deposition process and result of a 30cm long design modeled after the maple seed.\nThe structure obtains its inertia from chitosan-alginate reinforcement lines that follow the structural\nbending diagram of the construct. The clear color and tensile strength of the infill films are provided by a chitosan 3% interstitial filling. Figure 3-7b illustrates the deposition process and result\nof a 50cm long dragonfly wing design. The structure obtains its inertia from the cell pattern of\nchitosan-alginate reinforcement paths, and its tensile strength from chitosan 6% interstitial films.\nDeposition of chitosan concentrations is achieved from 1% to 10% w/v in 1% acetic acid solution\nthrough static mixing at the nozzle.

The samples can have longer stability to moisture by submerging them\nin a 4% NaOH w/v aqueous solution for 5min once dried, and then dried again overnight. Nevertheless, chitosan-alginate composites will biodegrade over time when exposed to the environment.\nThis capability can be used to design temporary and highly ecological architectural-scale parts that\ncan interact with the environment by contributing to soil nutrient levels over time during decay.\nPlant growth on a 40mm diameter and 8mm height disc of mixed chitosan and plant soil is tested\nwith grass seeds growing over a week with no loss of disc consistency or integrity (Mogas-Soldevila\net al.

The technology enables the deposition of functionally graded constructs with structural hierarchies made of basic building blocks and processed\nvia water and low impact chemicals. The technology enables the deposition and curing of constructs at room temperature, with no external energy sources other than mechanical extrusion and\ndisplacement of the nozzle.\n\n37\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nFigure3-9: Customized multi-barrel extrusion headfor diverse viscosity water-basedmaterials.\n\n3.2.2\n\nPneumatic Biomaterials Digital Fabrication\n\nFurther research is presented in this section that improves the mechanical fabrication platform prototype by designing a pneumatic extrusion system (using air pressure and solenoid valves), instead\nof the presented volume-driven system (using stepper-motors), that provides for the generation of\nmore complex extrusion paths. In terms of further material explorations: cellulose chopped fibers\nprovide enhanced mechanical properties of printed objects. In terms of advanced controls: mechanical property prediction models should be integrated to inform the variations of geometrical and\nchemical design of the objects. Figure 3-8 illustrates the designed pneumatic-driven manufacturing\nplatform with fully synchronized fabrication parameters for position, speed and air pressure via material property constraints (Duro-Royo et al.

The platform is composed of an existing 6-axis\nrobotic arm (Kuka KR 10 R1 100) as a positioning system operated via Ethernet instructions (Figure 3-8(1)); a customized pneumatic deposition platform operated via serial instructions carrying 6\nbarrels of different structural capacity hydrogels (Figure 3-9, Figure 3-8(2)); a security envelope for\noperation of the robotic system (Figure 3-8(3)); a 1 m-wide and unlimited length print bed (Figure 38(4)); a computer-controlled evaporation system (Figure 3-8(5)); and finally a lOm-long workspace\nand storage cabinet (Figure 3-8(6)). The water locked within the polymeric materials allows for\ntotal self-bonding as well as self-repair of layers and sections of the print. Consequently, structures\nspan a sliding print bed with virtually-infinite longitude allowing for structural construct generation\nbeyond the robotic arm reach, which overcomes the gantry size limitation of current additive manufacturing technologies (Oxman [2011]).\n38\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\na\n\nAxiat Load (N) - Time Is)\n\n-mm inner dam\n2mm inner diam_\n\n_\n\nViscosity (Pa.sl - Shear Stress (Pal\n\n-a\n\n1% SA\n3% SA\n5% SA\n\nFigure 3-10: (a) Hydrogel material gradients vary from 1% to 12% concentration of biopolymer in water Material\ncharacterizationssuch as axial load and shear rate are used to inform hardware design and software implementation.\n(b) The hardwareplatform is composed of a custom multi-barreldeposition system and a positioningrobotic arm. Figure\nfrom Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2015a].\n\nHardware: The pneumatic assembly is designed to additively fabricate large-scale structures made\nof water-based materials. It is composed of six large-capacity clear plastic barrels containing hydrogels of different viscosities and is attached to the end-effector of an existing 6-axis robotic arm,\nconnected to a positive and negative air pressure system. Both pneumatic assembly and robotic arm\nare digitally controlled to tune pressure and speed on-the-fly based on desired extrusion geometries\nand material properties (Figure 3-10b) (Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2015a]).\nSoftware: An integrated design workflow is implemented in the C# language within the Rhinoceros3D\nplatform; in C++ language as a stand-alone applet for mechanical synchronization of deposition and\npositioning platforms; and as custom firmware loaded into the deposition electronic assembly. Instructions generated by the software are implemented to achieve full synchronization of deposition\nand positioning, including the incorporation of material metadata with direct feedback to and from\nhardware (Figure 3-1 la) (Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2015b]).\n39\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nA Material-driven Computational Workflow: The computational workflow is designed to integrate physical parameters associated with material and hardware constraints, to compute relationships between these parameters based on material viscosity, extrusion pressure, and deposition\nspeed; and to encode these relationships through customized instructions in the forms of metadata\nthat is communicated to the fabrication platform (Duro-Royo et al. [2015], Mogas-Soldevila et al.\n\n[2015b]).\nMaterial-driven Property Variation: The system encodes an array of independent parameters\nassociated with basic mechanical and chemical material properties, as well as platform-dependent\nconstraints given by the fabrication system such as viscosities; shear rates, barrel types, hardware\nresponse times, and/or envelope size. These parameters are then combined with design-specific variants such as nozzle type, material composition, as well as time-dependent pressure maps. Resulting\ncalculations output necessary flow-rates, barrel refill patterns and positioning speeds. Finally, custom fabrication instructions are generated as output, encoding motion and extrusion commands to\nthe pneumatic deposition and robotic positioning systems respectively. Computer-controlled negative pressure is achieved via a vacuum pump (v), positive pressure via a compressed air tank (c)\nand a digital PSI regulator (r). Synchronized instructions given by both deposition and positioning\nplatforms are represented by the home position in 3D space (H), motion (M), extrusion initiation\nvalues based on material properties (E), partial and final position targets including time delays (T)\nand barrel refill pattern (R) (Figure 3-11 a left) (Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2015b]).\n\nMaterial-driven Hierarchical Structuring: Hierarchical structuring of printed components is obtained across three levels of resolution associated with the additive manufacturing process (Figure 3-\n\n11 a, right, Figure 3-1 lb): At the first level of resolution, material is distributed locally through varying layering strategies and stiffness gradients. At the second level of resolution, material is extruded\nin longitudinal regions with variable extrusion height and width associated with pressure data given\nby the deposition platform and the nozzle (Figure 3-1 lb). Finally, at the third level of resolution,\nglobal topologic effects are obtained across the entire construct through geometrically patterning\nthe overall shape (Figure 3-11 a, right). It is important to note that local layering, regional extrusion gradients, and global geometric patterning are designed and fabricated in 2-dimensions (2D).\nSpecifically, designs are not modeled in 3D; rather, they are composed of 2D extrusions that are\nassociated with, and informed by, material properties, robotic arm speed and nozzle speed. Depositions of material hierarchies with varying stiffness are extruded flat on a two-dimensional substrate\n(Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2015b]).\n\nMaterial-driven Shape Formation: Hydration guided shape formation is informed by both intrinsic constraints (relating to material properties, e.g. elastic modulus) and extrinsic constraints\n(relating to the environment, e.g. thermal maps).

Chitosan is a polysaccharide derived from chitin (Fernandez and\nIngber [2014]). Chitins chemical structure is similar to cellulose and can be found in exoskeletons\nof insects and crustaceans as well as in some fungi (Vincent [2012]). The non-toxicity, solubility,\ncapacity for swelling, and chemical versatility of chitosan allow for the development of functionalized materials that can be used in multiple scales such as drug delivery, tissue scaffolding, consumer\nproducts or architectural parts (Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014], Fernandez and Ingber [2014], Billiet\net al. [2012], Malda et al. [2013]).\nFor the purpose of this research, chitosan powder 85% de-acetylated and acetic acid are purchased\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich. Chitosan powder is processed into gel at 3%, 6%, 9%, and 12% w/v concentrations using 4% w/v acetic acid in aqueous solution. A concentration of 3% has a translucent\nappearance and displays similar consistency to watery honey. A concentration of 12% has an opaque\nappearance and displays the consistency of natural rubber.\n\n42\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nb\n\na Material [concentration w/vI - UTStMPal\n27.72\n\n4% in 5%AA\n\n37.19\n\n6% (Sigma)\nS(Prim)\n\nw/v\n\n45.68\n\n3% LV (Primex)\n0.00\n\nc\n\n6% w/v\n\n.__\n\n34%\n\n3%____________3__\n\n5.00\n\n10.00\n\n15.00\n\n20.00\n\n25A\n\n30.0\n\n3500\n\nA00\n\n45.00\n\n3% w/v\n\n50.00\n\nd\n\nFigure 3-13: (a) Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) testing results of chitosanfilm dog-bones in different concentrations\nand purchasedfrom diferentcompanies (b) Chitosan concentrationsin gel state (c) 3D printedand lasercut dog-bones\nbefore being tested (d) Instron mechanical tester with a 9071.85kg reversible load cell.

Extensive empirical testing results demonstrate that\na maximum axial load of 75N and maximum linear plunger motion of 50mm/s present a consistent flow rate with the different gel viscosities (Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014], Mogas-Soldevila and\nOxman [2015]). Such material-driven parameters are used to dimension and design the presented\nenabling technology for large-scale digital fabrication of chitosan gels.\nPreliminary testing of deposited materials shows promising 40MPa UTS (Ultimate Tensile Strength)\ncomparable to other 3D-printing filament materials such as Nylon, ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene\nStyrene) or PLA (Polylactic Acid). To perform UTS testing, deposited chitosan materials in different concentrations (3%, 4% and 6% w/v in 4% acetic acid in aqueous solution) and sourced from\ndifferent manufacturers (Sigma Aldrich and Primex) are dried overnight into 0.5mm thick films and\nlaser cut into dog-bones that are tested under an Instron machine (Figure 3-13).\nFurther research is being conducted in chitosan-based composites incorporating glycerin plasticizers for increased flexibility, as well as fibrous and granular fillers in order to generate components\nwith compression and bending capabilities (Mogas-Soldevila and Oxman [2015]).\n\n3.3.1\n\nComposites Design Catalogue\n\nThe objects presented in this section, are fabricated and cured at room temperature, dramatically\nreducing the need for external energy sources other than air-actuated extrusion and displacement of\n\n43\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nthe nozzle head [16, 18, 19]. Initial results of deposited and dried chitosan bio-plastic films show an\nultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 40mPa comparable to nylon or wood in the direction of the fiber\n(Figure 3-15d) (Mogas-Soldevila and Oxman [2015]).\nNatural thickeners such as sodium alginate powder can be incorporated into chitosan gels to generate shear thinning effects in the material barrel, allowing for the materials to extrude easily under\nshear forces, and to become more viscous once extruded effectively defining the extruded geometry\n(Figure 3-15c). Various other fillers such as sand, soil, hemp fiber, seeds, calcium carbonate, sodium\nbicarbonate or polyacrylamide storing crystals, have been combined with chitosan and sodium alginate hydrogels (Figure 3-15b). Such structures display integrity after drying due to the binding\ncapabilities of polysaccharide gels. Hemp long fibers, sodium bicarbonate, and polyacrylamide\nchitosan-based composites display irregularities, material heterogeneity, and pose extrusion issues\ndue to the difficult control of chemical reactions or filler distribution at the nozzle. Sand, soil, and\ncalcium carbonate chitosan-based composites display sub-millimeter surface resolution when dried\ndue to the dense packing of their grains (Mogas-Soldevila and Oxman [2015]).\nIn future research other water-based materials can be used that are stored in air-tight extruder barrels\nat room temperature and that cure at room temperature by natural evaporation once out of the barrel.\nFor instance, organic resins, polyvinyl alcohols, clay, plaster, calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate\ncompounds in concrete. These materials can also be combined with granular or fibrous fillers. In\nfuture iterations, the platforms end-effector could be replaced with a heated nozzle and a filament\nmaterial feed to extrude thermoplastics typically used in fused deposition modeling (FDM) such as\npoly-lactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), nylon etc.\nInitial Fabrication Results: These initial results encourage further research into natural volumetric\nfillers for 3D printing of fully recyclable and naturally biodegradable objects such as compost containers or vegetation planters harvesting chitosans fertilizer and plant growth promoting properties.\n\nMoreover, the antimicrobial effects of chitosan gels, combined with fibrous or granular fillers, could\nbe applied to food packaging, exo-prosthetic devices, toys, or single-use consumer products such as\ncups or tableware (Mogas-Soldevila and Oxman [2015]).\nIn order to test and evaluate some of the materials designed, constructs are digitally fabricated layer\nby layer with composite materials containing; chitosan (CHI) in diverse concentrations (3%, 6%\nand 10% w/v) in acetic acid aqueous solution (1% w/v); cellulose microfibers (CEL) in CHI solution (100% w/v in 3% CHI solution); and sodium alginate powder (SA) in CHI solution (4%\nw/v). Novel explorations on ceramic-chitosan composites have also been undertaken. In particular,\ninsoluble kaolinite ceramic nano platelets in slurry (KAO) in 50%, 100%, and 150% by volume,\nare combined with chitosan (CHI), cellulose micro-fibers (CEL) and sodium alginate (SA) solutions in diverse concentrations and deposited in layers resulting in bio-ceramic composites inspired\nby naturally occurring nacre nano-scale arrangements. The multi-material 3D printing system is\nequipped with 6 material containers that can be connected to nozzles of varying sizes (from 0.7 to\n9mm inner diam.) in order to achieve different resolutions along the printed objects.

For instance, in a 50cm long design inspired by the dragonfly wing,\nCHI and SA composites can be printed as structural bending-resistant venations, and clear CHI 3%\nsolutions can be deposited and bonded to such venations to create a tension-resistant membrane in\nthe construct [18] (Figure 3-16a top). The concentration of SA in CHI solution can be graded to\nprovide for optical density variation from: 1% CHI and 10% SA, to 10% CHI and 1% SA (Figure 316a bottom).

CEL extrusions can also be combined with 3% CHI depositions as in the membrane\nof a strong lm long object with CEL spine-like venations (Figure 3-16b bottom). The combination of strong CEL members and tensile 3% CHI membrane results in a higher degree of structural\nbioperformance of the final dried object (Mogas-Soldevila and Oxman [2015]). The deposited\nceramic samples basedon kaolinite and chitosan are analyzed using scanning electron microscopy\nis\nand display local alignment of the platelets (Figure 3-14) (Lizardo [2015]). Moreover, kaolinite\ncoma soft white layered silicate clay mineral that constitutes the most abundant clay on Earth, its\nrelevant for\nbination with chitosan and cellulose, the most abundant polymers on Earth, can be very\nmacro-scale applications in architectural additively manufactured components under compressive\nas well as tensile loads.

However, research into additive manufacturing processes for sustainable structures is still in\nits infancy, specifically in disciplines such as product engineering, product design and architectural\ndesign. Chitin, alginate and their respective chitosan and sodium alginate derivates, are responsible\nfor some of the most remarkable mechanical properties exhibited by natural materials, including\nseaweed gum, nacre, insect cuticle, and crustacean shells, and are as abundant on earth as cellulose, the main constituent of cotton or wood (Wiggins [1990], Lieleg and Ribbeck [2011], Vincent\n[2012]).\n\n47\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nThe Cycle of Water: In Nature, water provides for invisible support, its function is structural,\nmediating between the internal chemistry and the external environment. In Water-based Design\nResearch water composes a full closed cycle as it is used in all steps of the design process - from\nmaterial formation to product biodegradability. Specifically, in the research presented here water\nis used to; (I) chemically tune bio-materials to obtain different structural capacity properties, (II)\nenable \"fabricabitity\" in a liquid-to-paste extrusion-based digital manufacturing platform, (III) provide for the behavioral, functional and structural design of deposited constructs by hydration storage\nbased flexibility, (IV) drive the shape-finding behavior of structures via hierarchical load distribution by differential evaporation patterns, and finally, (V) induce full recyclability and reuse of the\nbio-materials composing the objects produced with the fabrication platform.\n\n3.4\n\nMaterial Studies for Design Templating\n\nI define design templates as frameworks for data translation that inform and encode material and\nimmaterial performance criteria. For example, an anticipated load map can be used as a template\nfor structural component thickness; whereas a thermal map can be used to template surface thickness and porosity for ventilation purposes. Such templates accommodate property variation in the\ncourse of the design process, while ensuring the implementation of the main algorithm. They tailor\nand integrate structural, manufacturing and environmental design templates relating to multi-scale\nfeature resolution and global structure formation and performance.\nIn order to do so, Jorge Duro-Royo and I implemented a seamless computational process encoding\nvirtual design and physical digital fabrication that relates to the MIT Mediated Matter Group's ongoing research on multi-dimensional, media and trans-disciplinary data informed design workflows.\nI demonstrate in this thesis the results of water-based fabrication: fully biodegradable architectural-\n\nscale structures that are additively manufactured, self-supportive, lightweight, and materially heterogeneous. Variable flow rates, differentially distributed material properties, and environmental\ncontrol inform self-folding by shrinkage of the constructs as water evaporates from the water-based\ndeposited gels (Duro-Royo et al. [2015, 2014a], Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014]). Results display\na range of structural behavior (Figure 3-17b) and represent a response to some of the planets distresses related to the construction industrys unsustainable practices.\nBioinspiration: Initial bottom-up empirical studies involve the design and fabrication of functional\npatterns inspired by insect wing and leaf venation geometry, mimicking structure-and-skin graded\narchitectures. In particular, dragonfly wings are passive lightweight structures supporting dynamic\nloading and employing high corrugation to increase stiffness and strength (Jongerius and Lentink\n[2010]) (Figure 3-17a). It is interesting to note that the Youngs modulus of dragonfly wings can vary\nwidely within the structure partly due to hydration patterns induced in the presence of chitin and\nproteins altering local properties (Donoughe et al. [2011], Jongerius and Lentink [2010]) and providing for both graded flexibility and graded tensile strength along the wing from the joint to the tip\n48\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nb\n\na\n\nb\n\nI,\n\nI\n\nIi\n\nEL-\n\ni\n\n/\n\n/M\n\n1cm\nFigure 3-17: Experiments in hierarchicaladditive manufacturingstrategies.

Bottom: front view of large-scalestructural experiments when dried. Figurefrom\nMogas-Soldevila et al. [2015a].\n\n(Fernandez and Ingber [2014]). As insect wings, leafs are flat structures that maximize surface-tovolume ratios. Their venations are two-dimensional ramifying structures that tightly relate form and\nfunction performing both transportation of mass and energy, and distributing force fields across the\nsurface area of the leaf structure (Roth-Nebelsick et al. [2001], Sack and Scoffoni [2013]). The highest mechanical stresses in leafs occur along their longitudinal axes; and transversal parallel veins\ncontribute to stabilize bending forces (Figure 3-17a). Both longitudinal and transversal structural\nsystems are lignin-based with a high elastic modulus, which, when combined with hydration and\nturgor pressure within cells, provides support and allows for high flexibility to reconfigure or fold\nunder mechanical loading (Roth-Nebelsick et al. [2001], Sack and Scoffoni [2013]). Such support\nand functional variation strategies, as well as the use of primary and secondary structural systems,\nare applicable to architectural structural cantilevers, shells and spatial structures (Mogas-Soldevila\net al. [2015a]).\nDigitalization: Structural design patterns are synthesized combining strategies from both voronoibased insect wing patterns, and leaf ramifying venations in order to obtain functional and mechanical gradients. Functional gradients, spanning column-like behavior to surface-like behavior, are\nobtained by negotiating geometrical pattern density and hydration rates (Figure 3-17b bottom).

Finally,\noptical gradients are obtained that are directly proportional to structural gradients and are a result\nof grading material concentration from 3% w/v -translucent- to 12% w/v opaque - in deposited\ngels. The constructs are lm to 70cm wide and range from 2.5 to 3m tall when dry (Figure 3-17b\nbottom). In the presented implementation, as in insect wings and many leaf types (Roth-Nebelsick\net al. [2001], Sack and Scoffoni [2013]), the size of the local diameter of load bearing members\nwith respect to the global size of the structure is key to guaranty self-support and bending stability\nfor cantilevered performance of the constructs.\n\n3.4.1\n\nStructural Design Templating\n\nIn the constructs designed and presented next, structural template maps are designed based on hierarchical flow of loads encoded into principal and secondary structure streamlines. The principal\nstructure is longitudinal to the global shape of the construct and provides for stiffness employing\nthicker diameter members and higher material concentrations as can be observed in leaf venation\nand insect wing structures. The secondary structure can be semi-parallel or semi-perpendicular to\nthe principal structure and is composed of hierarchical networks of thinner member diameters and\nlower concentration materials. Parallel secondary structures allow for column-forming structures,\n\n50\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nand perpendicular secondary structures allow for wall-forming structures. Figure 3-18a shows principal and secondary streamlined structural pattern generation by interpolating 2D vector fields from\n3D scalar fields. Desired 3D surfaces are modeled and their gradient of slope mapped into 2D vector\nfields that represent local structural behavior. The vector fields are then computed into continuous\nprincipal and secondary directions of flow (Figure 3-18a) (Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2015a]).\n\nRobotic Manufacturing Templating\n\n3.4.2\n\nOnce the streamlines for principal and secondary directions are determined, hierarchical material\ndistribution is implemented. There are three ways to determine differentiated material distribution\nto achieve selective structural capacity; pressure variation can be implemented along selected lines\nresulting in continuously varying material accumulation (Figure 3-18b); material concentration can\nbe assigned to each trajectory resulting in stiffness gradients from lower to higher concentrations;\nand, finally, layering onto dry deposited material provides higher degree of reinforcement (DuroRoyo et al. [2015], Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014]). Such strategies are encoded into position, speed,\npressure, and material instructions that are sent in real-time to both positioning and deposition\nplatforms (for further detail on manufacturing instruction generation see Duro-Royo et al. [2015,\n2014a]).\n\n3.4.3\n\nEnvironmental Performance Templating\n\nHydrogel materials are deposited in geometrical and pressure patterns onto a flat substrate following\ninstruction parameters. As water evaporates, shrinking forces accumulate across the networked gel\nand induce self-folding once the construct is removed from the substrate. In order to distribute\nhydration across large-scale depositions, a computerized evaporation control system can be easily\nimplemented composed of 100 variable speed fans with differential control according to desired\ndegrees of final hydration compared against thermal imaging of the deposition (Figure 3-18c) (see\nMogas-Soldevila et al. [2015b], Duro-Royo et al. [2015] for additional detail). Hydration control\nallows for increased final folding in hydrated areas providing for structural interface joints as shown\nat the foot of the dry structure in Figure 3-18c. If uncoated, the structures will fully biodegrade\nproviding nutrients as they decay in contact with the environment. Such materials can be fully\nrecovered and reused if dissolved in water (Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014]).\n\n3.5\n\nResulting Water-based Products and Utilities\n\nPresented here are variable property biomaterial-based components 3D printed at room temperature, using relatively little energy and mild chemicals. Applications of the design and manufacturing method range in scale and function form lightweight robotics such as flapping micro vehicles,\ncell growth promoting environments such as biocompatible wearable devices in contact with regenerating tissue, biofuel-producing bacterial culture supports (Patrick [2015]), fully compostable\n\n51\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nFigure 3-19: Perspective view of a typical structural assembly and research exhibit focusing on water-based additive\nfabricationand biologicaldesign at the MIT Media Lab, 2014.\n\nconsumables, ecosystem-enhancing constructs that replenish soils with nutrients as they decay, and\ntemporary biodegradable architectural structures or building skins.

[2015a, 2014]).\nBy deriving fabrication technologies, structural design, and environmental adaptability from materialdriven research, novel cross-disciplinary multi-functional properties such as; optical gradation proportional to load-baring capacity; merging of structure and skin functions within the same material\nsystem; energy and resources savings due to material environmental responsiveness; emergence\nof functionally-graded shape induced by time, air and water; or the possibility to flow biofuelproducing organisms within structural stress lines of the constructs. The lightweight robotically\nfabricated biomaterial structures represent an ecological and economical approach to materially\nheterogeneous formation by design, and an innovative exploration into future biocompatible living\n\n52\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nFigure3-20: Bioplastic-basedfully recyclable packagingproducts composed of plasticized CHI 10% concentrationand\nplasticized CHI 10% concentrationwith black food coloring additive.\n\nspaces that can have a high impact in alleviating our planets resources and health issues.\n\n3.5.2\n\nMeso: Product Design Applications\n\nProduct-scale fully recyclable applications of this research are very promising and range in scale\nand function. Lightweight robotics applications can include flapping micro vehicles. Wearable\ndevices include fashion items such as skirts and jackets (Figure 3-24), jewelry, purses, or baskets\n(Figure 3-22). In fashion items, flexibility and body adaptation are achieved through discontinuous\nrobotic deposition of CHI 6%, 8% and 10%, on top of CHI 3% continuously deposited layer.\nFully compostable consumables include packaging boxes (Figure 3-20), cups, cutlery or grocery\nbags (Figure 3-21) that could help alleviate plastic pollution affecting ocean ecosystems. Mediumscale recyclable facade components include flexible panels composed of chitosan or chitosan-cellulose\ncomposites (Figure 3-25). These bio-materials can be dyed with non-toxic food coloring products\nand achieve richer opacity qualities on top of the ones achieved by material concentration ranges\n(Figure 3-20).\n\n3.5.3\n\nMicro: Biological Design Applications\n\nChitosan is a naturally produced (Figure 3-26a) biocompatible material that is used in the medical\nindustry as cell scaffold for tissue growth Li and Ortiz [2014], Gutowska et al.

Consequently, in future iterations of the manufacturing platform presented herein, materials that can be used for biocompatible wearable devices in contact with regenerating tissue, or\nbiological microorganisms can be printed or placed using the pneumatic extruder with fine pressure\ntunability. Bacterial biofuel production pockets can be designed and deposited along with waterstoring gels and embedded nutrient and collection devices (Figure 3-23) (Mogas-Soldevila et al.\n[2015a]).\nFigure 3-26 illustrates preliminary results of bacterial culture growth on top of deposited chitosan samples (Figure 3-26b) (Patrick [2015]).\n\nBiological-driven design for medical or human-\n\naugmentation applications will involve further integration of environmental parameters and biological phenomena such as solar and airflow exposure patterns, temperature gradients, photosynthetic\nrates, nutrient availability, etc. As in leaf venation patterns, multifunctional aspects of hydraulic\ntransport and mechanical protection (Sack and Scoffoni [2013]) can be integrated into hierarchical\nstructures generating a true material-based ecosystem (Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2015a]).\n\n57\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\n58\n\nChapter 4\n\nConclusion\nArchitectural and environmental motivations encourage material-driven research in Water-based\nDigital Design and Fabrication. The role of water in manufacturing methods has the potential to\napproach the role of water in the biological world. Water-based Digital Design and Fabrication\nproposes the use of water as a key ingredient in all phases of the design and production process:\ninitiation, activation, shape formation and biodegradation. The platform and its associated methods\nserve to advance sustainable digital manufacturing techniques and propel them towards biologically inspired and informed manufacturing. Initial outcomes show the design and production of\nsustainable and self-supporting structural components across scales. Combining the use of natural regenerated abundant materials with a computer-controlled additive technology, structural and\nmaterial hierarchies can be designed and manufactured achieving sustainable products and building\ncomponents characterized by high spatial resolution in manufacturing that are multifunctional and\ncan biodegrade upon contact with water. Moreover, the design of the platform dramatically reduces\nthe need for external energy sources for fabrication other than air-actuated extrusion and displacement of the nozzle head, pointing towards new possibilities for sustainable additive manufacturing.\n\n4.1\n\nContributions\n\n4.1.1\n\nMaterial Studies in Practice\n\nArchitectural design and building construction can highly benefit from a deeper understanding of the\nstrategies and processes that lie behind formation of non-toxic, robust and efficient, yet chemically\nsimple and fully recyclable, materials and structures in nature. Today's industrial manufacturing\nprocesses are generally characterized as wasteful and their products often highly difficult to recycle.\nSpecifically, man-made plastics are the most energy intensive materials to degrade posing global\nhealth and resource issues as plastic pollution increases and fuel availability decreases. However,\nwater-based material structures in particular are naturally degradable while displaying exceptional\nand diverse mechanical properties. The present thesis' case study focuses on low-energy and mildcondition deposition systems for polysaccharide gels in order to design large-scale functionally\n\n59\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\ngraded structures with environmental capabilities for applications in architectural and product design.\n\n4.1.2\n\nMaterial Studies in Scholarship\n\nIt is fundamental that we identify the extraordinary properties of simple assembly, hierarchical structure, and material organization present in biological systems in order to develop efficient strategies\nfor energy and matter conservation in architecture. Architecture and product design scholarship can\nbenefit from; implementation of biological concepts of sustainability, comparison of disadvantages\nof current sustainable design practices with advantages of naturally formed sustainable systems,\nbottom-up design exploration strategies based on local material property design and assembly, to\nglobal structural system performance, and production of functionally complex and energy efficient\ndesigns inspired by biological sustainable strategies. Such integrated knowledge can be achieved\nby implementing novel architectural education and research practices informed by the disciplines\nof biology, material science, and advanced manufacturing.\n\n4.2\n\nPerspectives\n\n4.2.1\n\nResearch Limitations\n\nIn the presented Water-based Fabrication case study; natural materials are combined via bottom-up\nmatter behavior explorations and design of novel digital fabrication systems. The complex chemistry of the material composites studied for direct product fabrication, render the process rich yet\nunpredictable. However, the ecological implications of using and reusing, in a closed-cycle process,\nEarth's most abundant natural polymers and ceramics cellulose, chitosan and kaolinite - are vast and\nexciting. Moreover, such biologically produced materials also hold the potential to sustain life and\npromote growth of microorganisms allowing \"functionalization\" of manufactured structures into,\nfor example, b-iofuel producing fadctOriles (Patrick, [2v15).)\n\n%_therwate-ae\n\nconU eLional f\n\ntion materials can be used that are stored in air-tight extruder barrels at room temperature and that\ncure at room temperature by natural evaporation. For instance, organic resins, polyvinyl alcohols,\nclay, plaster, calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate compounds in concrete. These materials can\nalso be combined with granular or fibrous fillers proposing further work into the composites possibilities of this research.\n\n4.2.2\n\nFuture Directions\n\nBiological structures adapt to external stimuli by water-induced material property variation resulting in hierarchically structured forms (Vincent [2012], Mogas-Soldevila et al. [2014]). This thesis argues that conventional digital design tools and processes, by contrast, lack robust integration\nof computational design tools, digital fabrication environments and material. Preliminary results\n\n60\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nshown here demonstrate chemical tuning of biomaterials with digitally designed and fabricated\nstructured hierarchies informed by load-responsive arrangements as can be found in the biological world. Such case studies have informed my research into form generation and fabrication of\noptimized load distribution in meso-scale (product) and macro-scale (architectural) components.\nImportantly, I observe that, in the Water-based Fabrication platform presented here, the shear forces\ninvolved in the extrusion process of chitosan solutions induce alignment of the crystalline regions\nof the polymer in the direction of printing at the nano-scale, which affects the shaping of the cured\nconstructs at the meso-, and macro-scale. Consequently, hydration guided shape-formation studies are currently being conducted by the Mediated Matter group in collaboration with Prof. Katia\nBertoldi and doctoral student Johannes Overvelde (Bertoldi Group, Harvard School of Engineering\nand Applied Sciences) in order to establish informed nano-to-macro scale relationships between\nshape, material composition, hydration rates, and design-induced deformation.\nOur research into Water-based Digital Design and Fabrication engages all aspects of a complex\ndesign process - material-driven research, bottom-up experimentation, parallel novel technology\ndevelopment, and file-to-production feedback. Finally, the thesis advocates for the architect to play\nthe role of a cohesive thinker, as well as a rigorous science and aesthetics explorer, able to seed\nnovel processes that emerge from material studies towards digital design and advanced fabrication.\n\n61\n\nLaia Mogas Soldevila\nWater-based Digital Design and Fabrication - MIT 2015\n\nBiography\nLaia Mogas Soldevila is an Architect, currently a Research Assistant at the Mediated Matter Group,\nMIT Media Lab, focusing on design and digital fabrication of natural and biologically inspired\nmaterial systems.
