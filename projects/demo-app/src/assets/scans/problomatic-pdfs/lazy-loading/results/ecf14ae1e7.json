INTRODUCTION\nReinforced concrete is a strong durable building material that can be formed into many varied shapes\nand sizes ranging from a simple rectangular column, to a slender curved dome. Its utility and versatility is\nachieved by combining the best features of concrete and steel. Thus when they are combined, the steel is able to\nprovide the tensile strength and probably some of the shear strength while the concrete, strong in compression,\nprotects the steel to give durability and fire resistance. The tensile strength of concrete is only about 10 percent\nof the compressive strength. Hence, nearly all reinforced concrete structures are designed on the assumption that\nthe concrete does not resist any tensile forces. Reinforcement is designed to carry these tensile forces, which are\ntransferred by bond between the interfaces of the two materials (Mosley and Bungney, 1990).\nIn long span, solid reinforced concrete slabs of lengths greater than 5 meters, the self-weight becomes\nexcessive when compared to the applied dead and imposed loads, resulting in an uneconomic method of\nconstruction. One major way of overcoming this problem is to use ribbed slabs. A ribbed slab is a slab which\nvoids have been introduced to the underside to reduce dead weight and increase the efficiency of the concrete\nsection. A slightly deeper section is required but these stiffer floors facilitate longer spans and provision of\nholes. These longer spans are economic in the range of 8 to 12metres. The saving of materials tends to be offset\nby some complications in formwork (BS8110, 1997).\nWhen a structure is loaded, it will respond in a manner which depends on the type and magnitude of the\nload and the strength and stiffness of the structure. The satisfaction of these responses depends on the\nrequirements which must be satisfied. Such requirements might include safety of the structure against collapse,\nlimitation on damage or on deflection or any of a range of other criteria. These requirements are the limit state\nrequirements (Melchers, 1987).\nSlabs are major structural elements in structures, other than beams and columns. Standardized and\noptimized slabs can significantly enhance safety and durability of structures. This requires special techniques to\nachieve standardized and optimized slabs which can satisfy all the important design standards. These techniques\nenable the design of the most optimized floors. Structural floor systems made of reinforced concrete are required\nto efficiently transmit the floor loads to the vertical systems through shear, bending and torsion resisting\ncapacities. In addition to these requirements of strength, they are required to satisfy the deformation criteria also\nin terms of low deflection and crack width (Melchers, 1987).\nThis work elaborates the results obtained from the analytical study carried out on ribbed floor system\nvia obtaining the most optimum ribbed slabs design using the BS 8110 (1985; 1997) and EC2 (2008) design\nrequirements and propose a comprehensive design using an optimization technique for one of the most\ncommonly used slabs in building construction i.e ribbed slabs. An objective function was developed for the\npurpose of achieving an optimum slab design which will fulfill the entire BS 8110 (1985; 1997) and EC2 (2008)\ndesign requirements and simultaneously save construction cost.\n\nwww.ajer.org\n\nPage 60\n\nAmerican Journal of Engineering Research (AJER)\n\n2015\n\nII. BACKGROUND OF RIBBED/HOLLOW SLABS.\nRibbed slabs used herein refer to singly reinforced concrete slabs with hollow blocks or voids in them.\nThese types of structural plate systems can minimize formwork complexity by using standard modular, reusable\nformwork. Ribbed slab floors are very adaptable for accommodating a range of service openings. According to\nBS8110; 1:1997, hollow or solid blocks may be of any suitable material. When required to contribute to the\nstructural strength of a slab, slabs should be made of concrete or burnt clay; Have a characteristic strength of at\nleast 14N/mm2, measured on the net section, when axially loaded in the direction of compressive stress in the\nslab. When made of fired brick earth, clay or shale, conform to BS3921 (1985), BS EN772-1 (2000), BS EN\n772-3 (1998) and BS EN772-7 (1998).\n2.1\n\nSlabs with Permanent Blocks\nThe clear distance between ribs should not be more than 500mm. The width of the rib will be\ndetermined by consideration of cover, bar spacing and fire requirements. But the depth of the rib excluding the\ntopping should not exceed four times the width. If the blocks are suitably manufactured and have adequate\nstrength they can be considered to contribute to the strength of the slab in the design calculations, but in many\ndesigns no such allowance is made. These permanent blocks which are capable of contributing to the structural\nstrength if it can be jointed with cement-sand mortar. During construction the hollow tiles should be well soaked\nin water prior to placing the concrete, otherwise shrinkage cracking of the top concrete flange is liable to occur.\nThis probably develops strength for topping (Mohammed, 2006).\n\nFig 1: Permanent Blocks Contributing to Structural Strength. (Source: Mohammed, 2006).\n2.2\n\nConcept of Optimization\nThe concept of optimization is basic to much of what we do in our daily lives: a desire to do better or\nbe the best in one field or another. In engineering we wish to produce the best possible result with the available\nresources. The term optimization has been used in operations management, operations research, and engineering\nfor decades. The idea is to use mathematical techniques to arrive at the best solution, given what is being\noptimized (cost, profit, or time, for instance). To optimize a manufacturing system means that the effort to find\nbest solutions focuses on finding the most effective use of resources over time. In a highly competitive modern\nworld it is no longer sufficient to design a system whose performance of the required task is just satisfactory, it\nis essential to design the best system. Thus in modern design we must use tools which provide the desired\nresults in a timely and economical fashion (Vanderplaats, 2009).\nOptimization, or Mathematical Programming, refers to choosing the best element from some set of\navailable alternatives (Yang, 2008). In mathematical programming, this means solving problems in which one\nseeks to minimize or maximize a real function by systematically choosing the values of real or integer variables\nfrom within an allowed set. More generally, it means finding best available values of some objective function\ngiven a defined domain, including a variety of different types of objective functions and different types of\ndomains.\nAn optimization problem may be represented in the following way (Avriel, 2003):\nGiven: a function f: A\nR from some set A to the real numbers\nSought: an element x0 in A such that f (x0) ≤ f(x) for all x in A (minimization) or such that f(x0) ≥ f(x) for all x\nin A (maximization).\nA is some subset of the Euclidean space Rn , often specified by a set of constraints, equalities or\ninequalities that the members of A have to satisfy. The domain of A of f is called the search space or the choice\nset, while the elements of A are called feasible solutions. The f function is called an objective function. A\n\nwww.ajer.org\n\nPage 61\n\nAmerican Journal of Engineering Research (AJER)\n\n2015\n\nfeasible solution that maximizes (or minimizes, if that is the goal) the objective function is called an optimal\nsolution.\nGenerally, when the feasible region, or the objective function of the problem does not present\nconvexity, there may be several local minima and maxima, where a local minimum x* is defined as a point for\nwhich there exists some δ > 0 so that for all x such that\nx – x* ≤ δ;\nThe expression\nf (x*) ≤ f (x)\nHolds; that is to say, on some region around x* all of the function values are greater than or equal to the\nvalue at that point. Local maxima are defined similarly (Avriel, 2003).\n2.3\n\nMulti-Objective Optimization\nAdding more than one objective to an optimization problem adds complexity. For example, if you\nwanted to optimize a structural design, you would want a design that is both light and rigid. Since these two\nobjectives conflict, a trade-off exists. There will be one lightest design, one stiffest design, and an infinite\nnumber of designs that are some compromise of weight and stiffness. This set of trade-off designs is known as a\nPareto set. The curve created plotting weight against stiffness of the best designs is known as the Pareto frontier.\nA design is judged to be Pareto optimal if it is not dominated by other designs: a Pareto optimal design must be\nbetter than another design in at least one aspect. If it is worse than another design in all respects, then it is\ndominated and is not Pareto optimal (Papalambros and Wilde, 2000).\n2.4\n\nMulti-Modal Optimization\nOptimization problems are often multi-modal, that is they possess multiple good solutions\n(Papalambros and Wilde, 2000). They could all be globally good (same cost function value) or there could be a\nmix of globally good and locally good solutions. Obtaining all (or at least some of) the multiple solutions is the\ngoal of a multi-modal optimizer. Classical optimization techniques due to their iterative approach do not\nperform satisfactorily when they are used to obtain multiple solutions, since it is not guaranteed that different\nsolutions will be obtained even with different starting points in multiple runs of the algorithm. Evolutionary\nAlgorithms are however a very popular approach to obtain multiple solutions in a multi-modal optimization task\n(Papalambros and Wilde, 2000).\n2.5\n\nAnalytical Characterization of Optima\nThe extreme value theorem of Karl Weierstrass states that if a real-valued function f is continuous in\nthe closed and bounded interval [a,b], then f must attain its maximum and minimum value, each at least once.\nThat is, there exist numbers c and d in [a,b] such that (Jerome, 1986):\nf (c) ≥ f (x) ≥ f (d) for all x [ a,b ].\nA related theorem is the boundedness theorem which states that a continuous function f in the closed\ninterval [a,b] is bounded on that interval. That is, there exist real numbers m and M such that:\nm ≤ f (x) ≤ M for all x [ a,b ].\nThe extreme value theorem enriches the boundedness theorem by saying that not only is the function\nbounded, but it also attains its least upper bound as its maximum and its greatest lower bound as its minimum\n(Jerome, 1986).\nThe satisfiability problem, also called the feasibility problem, is just the problem of finding any\nfeasible solution at all without regard to objective value. This can be regarded as the special case of\nmathematical optimization where the objective value is the same for every solution, and thus any solution is\noptimal (Elster, 1993).\nMany optimization algorithms need to start from a feasible point. One way to obtain such a point is to\nrelax the feasibility conditions using a slack variable; with enough slack, any starting point is feasible. Then,\nminimize that slack variable until slack is null or negative (Elster, 1993).\nFermat's theorem states that optima of unconstrained problems are found at stationary points, where the\nfirst derivative or the gradient of the objective function is zero. More generally, they may be found at critical\npoints, where the first derivative or gradient of the objective function is zero or is undefined, or on the boundary\nof the choice set. An equation stating that the first derivative equals zero at an interior optimum is sometimes\ncalled a 'first-order condition'.\nOptima of inequality-constrained problems are instead found by the Lagrange multiplier method. This\nmethod calculates a system of inequalities called the 'Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions' or 'complementary\nslackness conditions', which may then be used to calculate the optimum.\n\nwww.ajer.org\n\nPage 62\n\nAmerican Journal of Engineering Research (AJER)\n\n2015\n\nWhile the first derivative test identifies points that might be optima, it cannot distinguish a point which\nis a minimum from one that is a maximum or one that is neither. When the objective function is twice\ndifferentiable, these cases can be distinguished by checking the second derivative or the matrix of second\nderivatives (called the Hessian matrix) in unconstrained problems, or a matrix of second derivatives of the\nobjective function and the constraints called the bordered Hessian. The conditions that distinguish maxima and\nminima from other stationary points are sometimes called 'second-order conditions' (Papalambros and Wilde,\n2000).\n\nIII. METHODOLOGY\n3.1\n\nConcept of Lagranges Multipliers Method\nThis is a popular optimization method. In mathematical optimization, the method of Lagrange\nmultipliers (named after Joseph Louis Lagrange) provides a strategy for finding the maximum/minimum of a\nfunction subject to constraints (Arfken, 1985).\nConsider the optimization problem\nf ( x , y)\nSubject to g(x, y) = c\nA new variable (λ) called a Lagrange multiplier is introduced, and the Lagrange function is defined by\n( x , y , ) = f ( x , y) +\n(g ( x , y) – c)\n(λ may be either added or subtracted). If (x,y) is a maximum for the original constrained problem, then there\nexists a λ such that (x,y,λ) is a stationary point for the Lagrange function (stationary points are those points\nwhere the partial derivatives of are zero). However, not all stationary points yield a solution of the original\nproblem. Thus, the method of Lagrange multipliers yields a necessary condition for optimality in constrained\nproblems (Arfken, 1985).\nConsider the two-dimensional problem introduced above:\nMaximize f (x, y)\nSubject to g(x, y) = c\nWe can visualize contours of f given by\nf ( x , y) = d\nFor various values of d, and the contour of g given by g(x,y) = c.\n\nFigure 2: Continuous line showing constraint g(x, y) = c. (Source: Arfken, 1985)\nThe dotted lines are the contours of f (x , y). The point where the continuous line touches the dotted line\ntangentially is our solution.\nSuppose we walk along the contour line with g = c. In general the contour lines of f and g may be\ndistinct, so following the contour line for g = c one could intersect with or cross the contour lines of f. This is\nequivalent to saying that while moving along the contour line for g = c the value of f can vary. Only when the\ncontour line for g = c meets contour lines of f tangentially, we do not increase or decrease the value of f — that\nis, when the contour lines touch but do not cross. The contour lines of f and g touch when the tangent vectors of\nthe contour lines are parallel. Since the gradient of a function is perpendicular to the contour lines, this is the\nsame as saying that the gradients of f and g are parallel (Arfken, 1985).\nThus we want points (x,y) where g(x,y) = c and\nx,y f = –\nx,yg,\nWhere\n/ , / )\nx,y f = (\nAnd\n/ , / )\nx,y g = (\n\nwww.ajer.org\n\nPage 63\n\nAmerican Journal of Engineering Research (AJER)\n\n2015\n\nare the respective gradients. The constant λ is required because although the two gradient vectors are parallel,\nthe magnitudes of the gradient vectors are generally not equal.\nTo incorporate these conditions into one equation, we introduce an auxiliary function:\n( x , y , ) = f ( x , y) + (g ( x , y) – c)\nand solve\n( x , y , ) = 0.\nx,y,λ\nThis is the method of Lagrange multipliers. Note that λ ( x ,y, ) = 0 implies g(x, y) = c.\n3.2\n\nDesign Procedure\nA ribbed slab floor will be adequately designed to comfortably support a given design load using the\nBS8110 (1985; 1997) and EC2 (2008) code. Using the ultimate moment of resistance of singly reinforced\nconcrete slabs, the optimization technique will thus be formulated. The goal here is to obtain the most cost\neffective, smallest and most reliable ribbed concrete slab section. It is important to note here that in order to\nachieve the optimum section, the major variables to be taken into consideration will be the height of slab,\neffective depth, area of reinforcing steel, and depth of concrete in compression. Also, member size restrictions\nwill not be imposed.\n\nIV. ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF A CONTINOUS RIBBED/HOLLOW SLAB\nA sample floor slab, consists of several units of ribbed slab, is simply supported at the ends. The\neffective span is 5.0 m, while the chosen characteristic dead load including finishes and partition is 1.5KN/m2\nand the characteristic live load is 2.0 kN/m2. The distance of the center to the center of the ribs is 300 mm,\nconcrete strength fcu = 30N/mm2, and characteristic reinforcement, fy = 460N/mm2\n4.1\n\nOptimization Process\nThe optimization of the above designed ribbed floor will thus be commenced using minimum weight\napproach and the Lagrange’s Multipliers Method. The target or aim as earlier mentioned will be to choose the\nmost cost effective, smallest, and most effective concrete section and reinforcement. The major variables to be\nconsidered will be the height of slab, effective depth, area of reinforcing steel, and depth of concrete in\ncompression.\nSince optimization definitely focuses on quantity of materials to be used, the cost function will consist of\nthe total sum of the cost of each material multiplied by its unit volume.\nWhere Vc is total volume of section minus volume of steel\n\nSince a unit volume is being considered\n\nDividing through by Cc\n\nƒ\n\nwww.ajer.org\n\nPage 64\n\nAmerican Journal of Engineering Research (AJER)\n\n2015\n\nMinimize\nSubject to\n\nWhere the value of ρ is restricted by BS8110 (1997) code and EC2 (2008) specifications for singly\nreinforced concrete slabs, the constraint is presented as:\nEquations\n,\nand\nare the ultimate moment of resistance of singly reinforced concrete\nsections presented in terms of concrete and steel strengths respectively according to BS8110 (1997) and EC\n(2008).\n\nwww.ajer.org\n\nPage 65\n\nAmerican Journal of Engineering Research (AJER)\n\nSince\n\n4.2\n\n2015\n\n, Therefore\n\n0.95\n\nρ\n\n0.87\n\nρ\n\nApplying Lagranges Multipliers Method\n\nwww.ajer.org\n\nPage 66\n\nAmerican Journal of Engineering Research (AJER)\n\n2015\n\nSubstituting λ from equation (33) into (35)\n\nRecall\n\nwww.ajer.org\n\nPage 67\n\nAmerican Journal of Engineering Research (AJER)\n\n2015\n\nTo optimize K, we obtain its partial derivative with respect to its principal variables R and D\n–\n\n– 2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n=0\n\nFor\n\nwww.ajer.org\n\nPage 68\n\nAmerican Journal of Engineering Research (AJER)\n\nFor\n\n2015\n\n,\n\n=\n=\n\nwww.ajer.org\n\nPage 69\n\nAmerican Journal of Engineering Research (AJER)\n\n2015\n\nThus the optimum values of the reinforcement ratio and the parameter K can be derived for any\ncombination of reinforcement and concrete strengths from equations (50) and (53) respectively using BS8110,\n(1997) and EC2 (2008).\n4.3 Results of Lagranges Multipliers Optimization Technique\nHaving successfully derived the formula for K, it is now obvious that the under-estimations for the various\ncombinations of concrete strength and steel strength can be obtained by substituting each value of K into the\nultimate moment of resistance formulae. Using the above derived formulae, the ribbed floor slab designed on\npage (25) can now be optimized. From that problem, the respective steel and concrete strengths were:fy = 460N/mm2 and,\nfcu = 30N/mm2\nTherefore from equation\n\nThe ultimate moment for a singly reinforced concrete section is given by BS8110 (1997) as :\n\nIn order to evaluate the resistance moment, equation (55) is represented as :\n\nEquating equation (56) to (54)\n\n30N/mm2 , therefore\n\nBut\n\nTherefore, for a singly reinforced concrete section made up of grade 30 concrete and steel strength of\n460N/mm2, the ultimate method of resistance is under-estimated by about 27.679 percent using the BS8110\n(1997).\nThe amount of reduction in the value of under-estimation as indicated in BS8110 (1997) simply shows the\nquantitative value of the quality control and cost savings associated with it. The value of o can be obtained for\nthe other reinforced ribbed floor slab concrete sections with various combinations of steel and concrete\nstrengths. An objective function value of less than 1 signifies the degree of effectiveness of the optimization\ntechnique used. The value of D has been taken as 0.06 as an example.\nAlso, steel strengths of 250N/mm2 and 460N/mm2 will be used by BS8110 (1997) as they are more\nrecognized by the code though EC2 (2008) will use steel strengths of 250N/mm2 and 500N/mm2. Other steel\nstrengths may also be used.\n\nS/NO\n\nTable 1: Data for Percentage Under-Estimation for Various Singly Reinforced\nRibbed Slab Concrete Sections Using BS8110 (1997).\nSteel\nConcrete\nPercentage\nstrength\nstrength\nKmopt\nUndero\n( fy )\n( fcu )\nestimation\nN/mm2\nN/mm2\n20\n3.981617437\n1.276159435\n27.6159\n25\n4.972927866\n1.275109709\n27.5110\n\nwww.ajer.org\n\nObjective\nFunction\n(ƒ)\n0.51266\n0.45440\n\nPage 70\n\nAmerican Journal of Engineering Research (AJER)\n1\n\n250\n\n2\n\n460\n\nS/NO\n\n1\n\n2\n\n30\n40\n50\n60\n20\n25\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\n5.961481481\n7.927765607\n9.874917709\n11.7966012\n3.985792558\n4.98098076\n5.97537042\n7.961121098\n9.941719533\n11.91574158\n\n1.273820829\n1.270475258\n1.266015091\n1.260320641\n1.277497615\n1.277174554\n1.276788511\n1.275820689\n1.274579427\n1.273049314\n\n2015\n27.3821\n27.0475\n26.6015\n26.0321\n27.7498\n27.7175\n27.6789\n27.5821\n27.4579\n27.3049\n\nTable 2: Data for Percentage Under-Estimation for Various Singly Reinforced\nRibbed Slab Concrete Sections Using EC2 (2008).\nSteel\nConcrete\nPercentage\nstrength\nstrength\nKmopt\nUndero\n( fy )\n( fcu )\nestimation\nN/mm2\nN/mm2\n20\n3.985256748\n1.193190643\n19.3191\n25\n4.976778921\n1.192042855\n19.2043\n250\n30\n5.965020821\n1.190622918\n19.0623\n40\n7.928516621\n1.186903686\n18.6904\n50\n9.868844856\n1.181897588\n18.1898\n60\n11.77803431\n1.175452526\n17.5453\n20\n3.990389914\n1.194727519\n19.4728\n25\n4.986761303\n1.194433845\n19.4434\n500\n30\n5.98234541\n1.19408092\n19.4081\n40\n7.970513496\n1.193190643\n19.3191\n50\n9.953557843\n1.192042855\n19.2043\n60\n11.93004164\n1.190622918\n19.0623\n\n0.41098\n0.34921\n0.30623\n0.27385\n0.52102\n0.46380\n0.42136\n0.36137\n0.32002\n0.28919\n\nObjective\nFunction\n(ƒ)\n0.51065\n0.45220\n0.40860\n0.34649\n0.30317\n0.27046\n0.52067\n0.46348\n0.42106\n0.36109\n0.31975\n0.28893\n\nV. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION\nFrom the results, it is obvious that optimization is possible as the current ultimate limit allowed by\nBS8110 (1997) and EC2 (2008) favors structure reliability over cost minimization. As observed in table 1 and 2\nabove, an under-estimation of averagely about 27 percent was deduced using BS8110 (1997) while the EC2\n(2008) had a lesser under-estimation percentage value of about 19 percent. For a major construction project,\noptimization could greatly reduce cost in terms of material usage.\nIt is also important to note that the under-estimation allowed by the British standard code and the EC2\n(2008) create accommodation for uncertainties in engineering design like human errors, variations in material\nstrength and variations in wind loading. It also ensures that high expense is traded by safety and reliability of the\nstructure.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n\nArfken G.: “Lagrange Multipliers in Mathematical Methods for Physicists”, 3rd edition, Orlando, FL: Academic Press, pp. 945950, 1985.\nAvriel M.: “Nonlinear Programming”, Analysis and Methods, Dover Publishing, 2003.\nBS8110: “British Standard Institution: The structural use of concrete:” Parts 1, 2, and 3.
