resources in Nova Scotia. Its utilization is the base of\nmany industries in the province. Wood which comes from the forest may be regarded as the final\nstage in the development of a living tree. It should be used wisely. To understand how wood\nmay be used to best advantage, it must be looked at closely. Learning about how wood grows,\nabout its structure, and about its strength, will provide the information you need. After reading\nthis module, you will look at your woodlot and be able to assess the quality of individual trees\nand the tree stand more effectively.\nThis module is dedicated to the wise utilization of wood through an understanding of its structure\nand properties. You may find the first part of this module quite technical but this information\nforms the framework for later lessons when sawmill products, strength properties, grading\ntechniques, and markets are discussed.\n\nTraditional Wood Products\nHistorically, wood was used mainly as a fuel, and the ash as a fertilizer (potash). Later it became\nwidely used as a building material; first as logs and later still as lumber. The list of wood\nproducts is endless since wood is such a versatile material and a renewable resource.\nUses of Wood\nIn general, the softwoods have been used primarily for pulp and paper, lumber, timbers, posts\nand poles, panel products such as plywood, laminated timbers, shingles and shakes, boats,\njoinery and interior finish, furniture, containers, musical instruments, and concrete formwork and\nscaffolding. Hardwoods are also used for some of the above applications, but primarily for\nfurniture, cabinetry, decorative veneer and plywood, flooring, cooperage (barrels, and casks),\npallets, turned products such as dowels, handles, etc., sporting goods, and toys and novelties, and\nfuelwood.\nChanges in Use\nThe above list is by no means complete. New used continually evolve while many traditional\nproducts are displaced by more modern materials. For example, excelsior (or wood-wool),\nmanufactured from poplar, basswood and pine, was once used extensively as a packing material\nwhen shipping fragile goods; today, styrofoam has displaced excelsior for this purpose. One\nexample of a reverse trend is the dramatic recapture of the flooring market by hardwood strips\nand parquet, displacing carpeting to a large extent. Many of the principal wood products will\nappear in more detail in a later section of this module.\n\nLesson One\n\nThe Structure of Wood\nIntroduction\nLessons 1 and 2 are the most `technical' in this Module. A good understanding of the structure\nof wood, and its properties, is helpful to achieve wise use.\nClassification of Woods\nWoods are grouped into `hardwoods' and `softwoods'. The terms are not entirely correct since\nsome `softwoods' are harder than some `hardwoods'. For example tamarack (eastern larch), a\nsoftwood, is harder than trembling aspen, a hardwood. However, the structure of the wood is\ndifferent for the two classes. A better classification would be needle-bearing trees and broad\nleaved trees.\nHow Wood is Formed\nAnnual Rings - Springwood and Summerwood\nWhen a tree seed germinates, it sends up a shoot of soft pith around which a layer of wood is\nformed. In a temperate climate like Nova Scotia, growing seasons are well defined: spring, and\nsummer/fall. As the young shoot grows the following year, another layer of wood is formed.\nThis annual growth pattern creates a series of circular or annual rings. When growth resumes\nin the spring, earlywood (or springwood) is formed. Springwood is usually light in colour and\nof low density. It contains much of the wood tissue that conducts water up and down the tree.\nWood produced later in the growing season is called latewood (or summerwood). It is usually\ndenser and darker than springwood. A freshly cut cross-section of a tree shows a layer of\nearlywood and a layer of latewood which form the annual rings (see Figure 1).\nCell Structure-Softwoods and Hardwoods\nSoftwoods\nCells - Using an inexpensive magnifier, the holes you\nsee on the endgrain of wood are\ncells. These cells\nare shaped like\nvery small tubes\nw i t h c l o s e d , Figure 1 Cross-section of pine showing cells of\npointed ends which cambium region, wood, bark and annual rings.\nare packed closely (Adapted from Mullins & McKnight. 1981)\ntogether in rows in the radial direction (see Figure 2) usually\nin a straight line from pith to bark.\nFigure 2 Cross-section of pine showing\nresin duct, wood rays and cells.\n(Adapted from Mullins & McKnight, 1981)\n\nThe cells are long, averaging about 3 mm for eastern softwood species and up to one and-a-half\ntimes as long for some of the large Western Canadian species. These are called longitudinal\ncells since they are arranged with their length running parallel to the length of the tree stem (see\nFigure 3). The earlywood cells are generally thin-walled and have large cavities while those of\nthe latewood have thicker walls and smaller cavities. This difference in cell wall thickness\nbetween summerwood and springwood accounts for the differences in density between the two\nlayers mentioned in the previous section. Some of these longitudinal cells provide a mechanism\nfor passage of water or sap up and down the tree by means of interconnecting channels through\nthe cell wall. These openings between cells are known as pits (Figure 3) which allow an\nunbroken communication from tree root up to the crown. The cells also provide strength to the\ntree stem.\nRays and Resin Ducts - Two other features appear in\nthe magnified cross-section. The first are long, radial\nlines running between the rows of longitudinal cells.\nThese rays (see Figure 4), are composed of horizontal\ncells usually in groups. In softwoods, rays are very\nsmall and are not readily seen with the naked eye.\nSecond are resin canals or resin ducts (Fig. 2), which\nappear on the cross-section interspersed among the\nnormal longitudinal cells. They are absent in some\nspecies, very noticeable in others - particularly pines,\nand are useful in identifying these woods.\n\nFigure 3 Longitudinal cells illustrating pits.\n(Adapted from Mullins & McKnight, 1981)\n\nThe Cambium - Another important element\nin tree growth and wood formation is the\ncambium. It is a single layer of living cells\nlocated between the inner bark and the wood\nin both softwoods and hardwoods. All wood Figure 4 Cross-section through hardwood showing rays and\nvessels. (Adapted from Mullins & McKnight, 1981)\noriginates at the cambium, except for twig and\nroot tips. These cells are responsible for increases in tree height and branch and root length. The\ncambium might be thought of as a \"rubber glove\" enveloping the entire tree - trunk and branches.\nCells in the cambium reproduce by division and deposit identical new wood cells on the previous\nlayer. At the same time, bark cells are deposited on previous bark layers on the opposite side.\nThis is how a tree grows -layer upon layer of wood cells being continually deposited during the\ngrowing season. Bark, as it grows old and dies, does not become extremely thick because it is\nsloughed off continually so that only very small increases in thickness occur during the life of\na tree.\nHardwoods\n\nVessels or Pores - Examining a cleanly cut cross section of yellow birch or sugar maple, you will\nsee a surface that has a number of visible holes (much larger holes than in the softwood section)\ninterspersed within what appears to be a solid surface. These holes are called vessels or pores\n(see Figure 5). They conduct water up the stem and provide channels for delivery of food to\nliving cells, particularly at the cambium. They do not occur in softwood. The remainder of the\nhardwood substance is largely made up of longitudinal cells similar to those in softwoods.\nHowever, the longitudinal cells in hardwoods are\nusually much smaller than in softwood and cannot as\na rule, be seen with a magnifier. They are also much\nshorter.\nDiffuse-porous and Ring-porous Woods Because of the presence of vessels, or pores, in\nhardwoods we refer to these species as porous, and\nsoftwoods as non-porous. Depending on the\ndistribution of the pores, or vessels, hardwoods are\nfurther divided into (a) ring-porous woods and (b)\nFigure 5 Cross-section of a diffuse-porous\ndiffuse-porous woods. In maple or birch the vessels\nhardwood.(Adapted from Mullins & McKnight,\nare more or less randomly distributed across the\n1981)\nannual ring as in Figure 5. The maples and birches\nare diffuse-porous woods. In the case of ash, elm, or oak, the vessels are largely concentrated\nin the inner, springwood, portion of the ring, forming a distinct ring of their own (see Figure 4).\nThese are known as ring-porous species.\nRing-porous woods exhibit smaller vessels elsewhere across the ring, but large ones occur in the\nspringwood, accenting annual rings.\nRays - Hardwoods do not contain resin ducts but they do have rays. You will recall that ray\ncells run horizontally across the tree stem (cross-section) in a radial direction. In hardwoods the\nrays vary greatly in character between species. In birch the rays appear as fine lines similar to\nsoftwoods. In sugar maple the rays are wider and more distinct, and appear as noticeable flecks\non the tangential surface. Tangential, radial and longitudinal represent the three different\ndirections (planes) in a piece of solid wood (see Figure 6).\nIn soft maple, they are less distinct but appear as staggered ridges on the radial face. Red oak\nshows its wide rays very clearly and, together with the large ring-oriented pores, create the\ndistinctive grain pattern of this species.\n\nGrain and Texture\nWood grain has a variety of meanings. The most widely accepted meaning refers to the\ndirection that wood will split. For example, straight grain, or cross grain. Axe handles are made\nfrom straight grained ash.\nGrain also describes the size and arrangement of\ncells in the wood. As mentioned earlier, this\nfeature gives oak its distinctive appearance.\nCarpenters and cabinet makers use the term open\ngrained (or coarse grained) for some ring-porous\nhardwoods.\nDiffuse-porous hardwoods and softwoods are\noften referred to as close-grained (or fine grained)\nwoods.\n\nFigure 6 Three planes used in describing cross-sections.\n\nFinally, grain can describe how a piece of lumber\nwas sawn in relation to the annual rings in the\ntree. Edge-grain (quarter sawn) and flat grain (flatsawn) are shown in Figure 7.\n\nTexture is another term used to describe grain. It usually refers to the size of the cells and is\ndescribed as fine-textured, even-textured, or coarse-textured. For example, white pine is regarded\nas fine-textured. The oaks are course-textured.\n\nFigure 7 Characteristics and slope of grain.\n\nVariations and Abnormal Wood\nBeing a natural substance, wood varies greatly, even within the same species. The following\nexamples show what variations you can expect to find.\nSpringwood/Summerwood Content/Density\nVariation in density in hardwoods is greatest for the ring-porous species. As growth slows, the\nlarge vessels, or pores, in the springwood of the rings make up an increasingly greater proportion\nof total wood substance. Since the pores contain large cavities the amount of wood substance\n(longitudinal cells) becomes quite small. This results in very light, low density wood.\nNote: Density, as will be seen in Lesson 2, is an excellent indicator of many wood properties particularly strength and yield, as related to the production of pulp.\nReaction Wood\nReaction wood is abnormal wood that occurs in the boles of leaning and crooked trees (and in\n\nbranches). It results in abnormal rings wider on one side than the other and is formed by the tree\nto counteract lean. It is the tree's response to this stress and its attempt to straighten itself. In\nhardwoods, this tension wood forms on the upper side of the lean. In softwoods, this\ncompression wood forms on the lower side of the leaning tree.\nTension Wood - Tension wood, formed on the upper side of leaning hardwood trees, is usually\nindicated by eccentric, or off-centre, growth rings (see Figure 8a). It may be seen on cut ends\nas a somewhat lustrous surface, sometimes with an uncharacteristic colour. On a piece of lumber\nit may often be detected by a fuzzy or woolly surface. Tension wood may cause warping during\ndrying, and in general is of lower strength than normal wood.\nWhen a piece containing tension wood does break, it shows a brashy failure - ie. a rather abrupt\nfailure across the piece, without the usual splintering as in normal wood. Hardwoods showing\nlarge amounts of tension wood are generally not acceptable for products where strength is a\nfactor, or for some grades of peeler logs.\nCompression Wood - Compression wood, formed on the underside of leaning softwood trees,\nis usually detected by: (1) a dark, reddish, colour; (2) annual rings on the underside that are wider\nthan normal and appear to have a high proportion of summerwood (see Figure 8b); and (3) a dull\nappearance.\nAlthough compression wood has a higher than-normal density, it is weak in some critical\nstrength properties. The most serious drawback of compression wood is its abnormal drying\nbehaviour. When normal wood in the form of lumber dries, it shrinks in thickness and width (by\npredictable amounts).\n\nIt shrinks very little (practically negligible) in length. Compression wood, however, shrinks in\nlength by more than 10 times that of normal wood. This causes bowing and twisting of certain\npieces of lumber. Compression wood is more easily recognized than tension wood and should\nbe avoided where strength is a prime requirement.\nHEARTWOOD AND SAPWOOD\nWhile a tree is young the wood conducts water (or sap) up the tree, stores food for growing, and\nprovides strength to the tree stem. This wood is called sapwood. Later, as the tree grows in\ndiameter, the cells toward the centre (pith) of the stem die. This core of dead cells around the pith\nis called heartwood. As the tree grows, the core of heartwood moves outward as well.\nThere is great variability in the proportion of sapwood to heartwood. In some woods, when the\ncells die and form heartwood, noticeable changes take place. The most common change is a\ndarkening in colour of the heartwood. Red oak and eastern white cedar are good examples of this\ndarkening process while the eastern spruces, balsam fir, and other hardwoods show practically\nno colour change in the heartwood. Heartwood should not be confused with the darkening in\ncolour due to activity of decay organisms.\nImportant changes occur when heartwood is created by dying sapwood cells. In some woods cedars and white oak for example -chemicals are deposited in the heartwood cells which impart\na high degree of natural decay resistance. In other species, the cells are completely blocked by\nanother kind of deposit that, in turn, reduces its ability to conduct water. This means that water\nis difficult to remove during drying. For the same reason, liquid preservatives are difficult to\nintroduce beyond the sapwood.\nWOOD IDENTIFICATION\nWe have touched on some of the features of wood that will help with identification. If you want\nto learn more about wood identification we suggest (1) Canadian Woods. 3rd Edition (see\nbelow); (2) Forintek Canada Corp., 319 rue Franquet, Ste-Foy, Quebec, GlV 4CF, have small,\nlabelled wood samples available, in boxes of 40 ($100 per box for non-members; $50 per box\nfor supporting members of Forintek); (3) You may wish to make up your own samples 1/4 in.\nthick, by 2 1⁄2 inches by 4 inches. They should be dry. With the above noted key, or by simply\nobserving prominent features, you will become proficient at identifying local species.\nFURTHER READING\n1.

Physical properties refer\nto density and moisture relations that affect its use. Mechanical properties refer to the strength\ncharacteristics of wood.\nPhysical Properties\nDensity\nLesson 1 showed that wood is a porous material made up of cells of various kinds. Depending\non the nature of these cells, some woods have more or less solid wood substance for a given\nsized piece. If you think of a brick of Swiss cheese (with all its holes) and an identical-size brick\nof cheddar, you can guess that the cheddar brick contains more cheese. So with wood, the fewer\nholes (cells), the more wood substance.\nThe amount of wood substance for a given volume determines density. Woods with more\nweight for a given volume have a higher density than woods with less weight. Both weight and\nvolume of wood are affected by the amount of moisture it contains. Therefore, when specifying\ndensity it is important to also state moisture conditions. For example, the density of air-dried\nbalsam fir is 430. This means it weighs 430 kg. per m3, at 12 percent moisture content - a\nstandard for strength testing and density measurement. By comparison, the density of red spruce\nis 450; and sugar maple, is 740, again both in the air-dry condition.\nAs discussed in Lesson 1, density is an excellent indicator of wood strength; the higher the\ndensity the stronger the wood. However, a wood with a density of 600 may not be twice as\nstrong as one with a density of 300. It depends on the strength properties being discussed. For\nexample, the amount of deflection of wood in response to a load (modulus of elasticity), as in\na joist or rafter, is an important strength property. The actual breaking strength of the piece,\nrupture (modulus of rupture), is also important.\nGrowth Rate\nIt has been shown how rate of growth affects the mechanical properties of wood. But how does\ngrowth rate affect density? There are no hard and fast rules applying to all species, on how\ngrowth affects density. Individual species, or groups of species, must be considered to get some\nidea how rate of growth affects density, and in turn, strength.\nGrowth rate affects the density of softwood differently for different species. In general, density\nvalues fall off more severely with very rapid growth, than with very slow growth. The optimum\nbeing something in between. The pulp and paper industry found out long ago that maximum\nyield of pulp was not simply an expression of volume of wood per hectare but had a lot to do\nwith growth rate of the trees.\nThe effect of growth rate on density is easier to predict for hardwoods. Density of diffuseporous species - maples, birches, and beech -do not vary with growth except perhaps for\nextremely slow growth. On the other hand, ring-porous species - oak and ash - show highest\ndensities (and strength) for moderately rapid growth. Very slow growth in this group results in\nmarked reduction of density. For hardwoods, strength is usually not a critical property.\n\nHardwoods are used more for their appearance and decorative features. However, for pallets,\nframe stock, and timbers, strength is a factor.\nProportions of Springwood & Summerwood\nTimber showing the greatest proportion of latewood - with thick-walled cells - has the highest\ndensity and in turn strength. Both growth rate and percentage of latewood are used in certain\ngrading rules for some species. When safety factors are especially important such as for\nscaffolding or bridge work, inspectors visually check the ends of timbers for percentage\nlatewood.\n\nMoisture Content\nFree Water and Bound Water\nWater exists in wood as either free water or bound water. Free water occurs within a cell\ncavity as a liquid. It is the easiest and first to be removed during drying. This free water moves\ntoward the end surfaces through connecting cells, and laterally through the pits of neighbouring\ncells. It is evaporated from the wood faces as well as the ends. The point at which all free water\nis removed from the cell cavity is known as the fibre saturation point (fsp) and is reached at\naround 30 percent moisture content.\nBound water is moisture absorbed within the cell wall. This water is molecularly bound to the\nwood molecules of the cell. It is therefore much more difficult to remove than free water. Figure\n9 shows this process. Shrinkage takes place only\nwhen bound water is removed.\n\nEffect of Moisture Loss on Strength\nThe loss of free water, down to the fsp, has no effect\non the strength of wood. However, when bound\nwater begins to be removed, most strength properties\nincrease. The increase in strength is directly related\nto the amount of moisture removed. Thus, other\nthings being equal, a spruce 2 x 4 (stud) is stronger at\n18 percent moisture content than one green from the\nsaw.\nFigure 9 Anatomy of longitudinal cells, in relation\nto moisture loss.\n\nOther Properties Affecting Strength\n\nSlope of Grain\nThis refers to a deviation of the line of longitudinal cells, to a straight line parallel to the sides\nof the piece of lumber. It may be caused by an abnormal growth pattern in the tree, or how the\nlog was sawn. It is usually expressed as a ratio; for example, 1 in 12 (finch of slope in 12-inches\nlength). A slope of grain of 1 in 6 results in a 60 percent reduction in bending strength (strength\nof a horizontal beam, such as a floor joist, for example). A 1 in 16 slope causes only a 20\npercent reduction (see Figure 7). Most lumber grading rules specify the maximum slope of grain\npermitted in the grade.\nKnots\nKnots, common in sawn products, are caused by limbs on the tree stem. When a saw cuts\n\nthrough a limb (or its stub) a knot remains. Depending on the angle of both the limb and the\nsaw, a round knot, an oval knot, or a spike knot (longitudinal) will result. For strength purposes\nknots are classified by size, number, form, and quality. The first two classes are self-evident.\nKnot form and quality are described as: tight, loose, intergrown, firm and rotten. Most grading\nrules take these factors into account.\nShakes and Checks\nThese are separations occurring in the wood (see Figure 10). Shakes parallel to the annual rings\nare called ring shake and those in the heart of the tree and perpendicular to the annual rings are\ncalled star shake. In living trees, both forms of shake are caused by wounds, but not all wounds\nresult in shake. Factors that may extend the formation of shake are, internal growth stresses,\nbending of the tree by wind and the freezing of free water within the cells. Checks are generally\nproduced in the rays of sawn-wood products during drying. Depending on their severity, checks\nand shakes have a very great affect in reducing the strength of wood.\n\nAgents Causing Wood Decay\nDecay\nDecay, or rot; is not permitted in wood used for structural purposes. Recognizing decay in wood\nis very important. Most decay in wood is caused by fungi. Some of these mushroom like\norganisms (see Figure 11) attack the wood, eventually destroying its cellular structure. Fungi\nmay originate in the growing tree or the wood may become infected after it is in use. Most fungi\noriginating in the growing tree do not continue to degrade the wood during use.\nThe most serious and common type of wood decay in softwoods in Canada is known as brown\nrot, or brown cubical rot. It is caused by two fungi and proceeds very quickly under favourable\nconditions for rot. These fungi cause most of the extensive losses from decay in wooden\nbuildings in North America. In hardwoods, the white rots are most common.\nStains, Molds, and Bacteria\nStains and molds in wood are not as serious as decay and are usually accepted in structural\ntimber in local markets. Stain may be caused by fungi and is often an indication of worse things\nto come. Usually, molds and stain fungi merely give an unpleasant colour to the wood. One\ncommon example is the sap staining fungi causing blue-stain in green wood. Bacteria, another\ntype of organism that attacks wood, and was once thought to result in little damage is now known\nto produce enzymes, which cause shakes in red oak. During kiln drying of red oak affected by\nthese bacteria, honeycombing and serious checking may often develop.\nConditions Promoting Decay\nTo develop and cause wood damage, fungi requires food, air, moisture, and warmth. If any one\nof these conditions is removed, the fungi will die or remain dormant. One of the most common\nmisconceptions and misused terms is `dry-rot'; often used to describe the brown cubical rot\nmentioned earlier. The dry condition may be due to the time one observes the damage - long after\nthe rot has taken place and perhaps on a dry day. Decay will not proceed unless there is sufficient\nmoisture available. The critical moisture content below which fungi cannot function is 20\npercent.\n\nFigure 10 Shakes and Checks\n\nFigure 11 Tree stem showing fungi conks, indicating\nvery advanced decay.\n(Adapter from Calvert & Petro, 1993)\n\nEffect of Silviculture on Wood Properties\nGood silviculture practices affect wood properties. In softwoods, good thinning and proper\nspacing can enhance growth rates, strength, and other properties. Moreover, spacing can be\ntailored to the targeted product. For pulpwood species, proper spacing can produce high quality\nfibre and yield which may not be the same as high volume. For trees destined for structural\nlumber, spacing can be done to produce a growth rate giving optimum strength. For yard lumber\n(general construction lumber) - where volume is the main goal - other spacing prescriptions\napply.\nIn hardwoods, quality is more important than volume. Remember, fairly high growth rates in\ndiffuse-porous woods are desirable. For ring-porous species, extremely high growth rates are\nnot desirable. Nor are extremely slow growth rates. Where strength is a factor six rings per inch\nis a minimum.\nFor decorative uses, somewhat slower growth rates are preferred to produce a finer texture.\nStands can be tended to provide the required qualities. For example, a sudden and severe\nopening up of the stand may cause the formation of branches in many trees. These become\nknots, in lumber or veneer. Selection harvesting and shelterwoods can be designed to remove\nold, decay-ridden trees. This practice will decrease the chances of infection occurring in the\nyounger trees in the stand. More will be said on silviculture and harvesting methods in the next\nlesson.\n\nWood Properties for Selected Products\nPulp & Paper\n1. Newsprint - mechanical and groundwood pulps. Most softwood species are acceptable, but\nthose with considerable latewood are not favoured (eg. larch, pine). Length of longitudinal cells;\nie. fibres, is important. Spruces, particularly black spruce, produce the highest quality newsprint\nlargely due to cell length. Thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP), now mainly used in newsprint\ninstallations, requires the same properties.\n2. Chemical Pulps - Sulphite and Kraft. Sulphite pulp is usually mixed with groundwood pulp\nfor newsprint. Kraft pulp is used in many applications, particularly for linerboard. Almost any\nspecies and quality of wood may be used for kraft. For sulphite, woods with very heavy latewood\nare not usable. Both produce strong pulps, and strength is related to longitudinal cell length.\nBlack spruce best demonstrates these qualities.\nLumber\n1. Softwood - Softwoods are used primarily for structural and construction lumber, but also find\ntheir way into products such as trusses and laminated timbers. These must contain pieces that\nhave properties favouring high strength, such as: moderate growth rate; high proportion of\nsummerwood; straight grain, no compression wood; low moisture content; no decay. For less\ndemanding uses, including construction lumber, most of these properties are not as important.\n2. Hardwood - Since hardwood is used extensively in decorative applications such as mouldings,\nfurniture and cabinets, its appearance is most important. Properties that enhance appearance and\nperformance include: moderate growth rate; well-defined annual rings, rays and pores to produce\na pleasing `grain'; absence of shakes or checks in finished product; all heartwood or all sapwood\nto feature colour integrity; very exact moisture content with little or no variation within or\nbetween pieces so that shrinkage does not take place in use.\n\nHandles and Turnery\nPieces should be strong, straight-grained, with a moderate growth rate, no tension wood, no\nknots, shakes, checks, or decay, high proportion of late wood.\nPanel Products\nThere is a range of panel products. One type is made from veneer logs, other types from lowdensity woods, and others from mill residue. Plywood is made from veneer, oriented strand\nboard (OSB) from aligned wafers, particle board from small particles, and fibreboard from fibres\nand fibre bundles.\nOSB wafers are sliced from small roundwood, usually poplar. Particleboard and fibreboard are\nproduced from a mixture of chipped roundwood (softwood and poplar) and softwood sawmill\nresidues (sawdust and planer shavings).\nSoftwood plywood and OSB can be used for structural purposes. Hardwood plywood is used in\nfurniture and cabinet making. Particleboard and fibreboard are also often used in finished\nproducts such as furniture.\nOther Products\nThere are many other wood products. Some of them have specialized properties. Recently\ndeveloped products include laminated veneer lumber (LVL), finger jointed lumber and\nedged glued panels. These are generally made from lower grade material (with corresponding\nlower level properties) to make a highly usable, high strength product.\n\nSelected Strength Values\nTable 1 showing strength and mechanical properties of wood is extracted from Canadian Woods\n(1). The following brief comments refer to it:\n1. Regard the values as relative to each other to get a good impression of strength.\n2. Rupture is a measure of the ultimate strength of wood at the breaking point.\n3. Elasticity is deflection in response to load. Even though a piece of wood will not break under\na load (weight) it may deflect to such an extent that it cannot be used. This applies to such\napplications as floor joists, rafters, etc.\n\nFurther Reading\n1. Mullins, E.J. and T.S.

For example, saw logs and pulpwood, are roundwood products. If you\nproceed to the next stage converting sawlogs into lumber in a small mill - you should have a\ngood idea of what affects the quality and value of roundwood. The following list of roundwood\nproducts proceeds from most valuable to least valuable: veneer logs, sawlogs, boltwood, posts\nand poles, pulpwood, and fuelwood, which includes domestic firewood and commercial\nfuelwood (to be chipped). Other roundwood products that may be exported include softwood\nlogs for plywood, bolts for hard board manufacture, bolts for bentwood products, and furniture\nbolts.\nIn addition, a number of special roundwood products\nare described in Lesson 5, where it seemed the grading\nand marketing elements were of greatest importance.\nThese include bolts for musical instrument stock, shakes\nand shingles, cooperage, and spoolwood\n\nRecognizing Products in the Standing Tree\nIt may be easier to recognize roundwood products in the standing tree before it has been felled.\nAll faces of the stem can be seen, which allows you to make some preliminary plans on how to\nbest buck the stem. Before looking at individual trees for what they will yield, examine the area\nto be cut. This will give you an overview of potential products, their quality and the type of\ndefects present. Some of the advantages are as follows:\n(1)\n\nYou may obtain an idea of relative volumes and qualities of products, making it easier to\nmark trees for removal.\n\n(2)\n\nIn mixed-wood stands, you may decide which species to favour.\n\n(3)\n\nHigh-quality trees tend to occur in groups, as do low-quality trees. Therefore, consider not\nonly an individual tree but also its neighbours in the stand.\n\n(4)\n\nAllows you to identify repetition of tree defects. For example, wood borers, and decay\nfungi, are often found in infected clusters of trees.\n\n(5)\n\nAllows you to identify past logging damage such as wounds at the base of trees. Infection\nby very aggressive fungi can cause widespread damage in hardwoods.\n\n(6)\n\nAllows you to identify repeated damage or evidence of decay fungi in its late stages. Where\ncertain areas are heavily infected, it may be necessary to amend your cutting plans and to\nremove such trees early on.\n\n(7) Allows you to identify damage in white pine by red rot in the stump area, and repeated\nweevil damage indicated by very acute branching in the stem and crooked stems (see Figure\n12). In general, spruces, younger fir, and other softwoods are quite resistant to various fungi\nand insect damage, such as borers.\n\nFigure 12 Acute branch knot in white pine, indicating prior weevil damage.\n\n(8)\n\nIn hardwoods, insect damage and decay fungi are more prevalent and can be identified.\nHowever, do not over estimate the amount of defect. Northern hardwoods - sugar maple\nin particular -have a way of sealing off their wounds.\n\nYou will also be able to assess the stand in terms of required size specifications for various\nroundwood products. Are there enough good softwood stems to leave growing for recovery of\nsaw logs? Can you get 13 inch, minimum 10 feet, butts in your hardwoods to qualify for a grade\n1 log? Or should they be allowed to grow a little longer?\n\nSilviculture Considerations\nSetting future stand objectives are at least as important as looking for products: A preliminary\nexamination of the area to be cut also allows you to think about silvicultural treatments. These\ntreatments may enhance certain properties of wood for specific products. For example, in a\nvigorous young stand of white pine you might prune the butt logs (16 ft.) of high-potential stems.\nThe effort will more than pay for itself in increased lumber grade and value in the future. Also\nconsider pruning young hardwood to increase veneer log yield.\nThere are several harvesting systems to consider: clearcutting, shelterwood cutting, selection\ncutting, seed tree cutting, and commercial thinning. Your choice will depend on the species you\nhave to work with, its condition, available markets, and, most importantly, your objectives. For\nmore information refer to Harvesting Methods in this series. Some systems focus on removing\nlow quality trees initially, which requires finding a market for the low quality wood. As a side\nnote, some poor quality and/or small trees can be left behind to compost into nutrients. They will\nnot be wasted.\n\nHarvesting implies two goals which should be considered:\n1. A supply of timber available at defined intervals, in perpetuity, from the woodlot (ie. it\nshould be sustainable).\n2. Quality of individual trees to be constantly up-graded by various silviculture and harvesting\ntechniques.\nOther goals of good management include aesthetic and ecological objectives. Finally, many\ntechniques can be used, within the terms of a specific treatment to enhance certain wood\nproperties already covered. Quality of softwood trees destined for sawlogs can be manipulated\nby growth rates and spacing treatment. Certain hardwoods, when released by cutting of adjacent\ntrees, are prone to spontaneous branching that reduces value substantially. To avoid this, ensure\nthat release is not too great or abrupt. The formation of reaction wood can to some extent be\ncontrolled by ensuring that those factors causing lean are minimized.\n\nProducts\nGeneral\nYou are now ready to determine the products to cut. Review the hardwood log and bolt grading\nrules (Tables 2, 3, 4 & 5). Reference 5, in Further Reading, provides a white pine saw log\ngrading rule. For other softwoods you will not require grading specifications unless you have\na special market; for example, spruce `clears'. In that case, one of the hardwood log grades, or\nthe pine log grades, could serve as a rough guide. At the outset develop your own product\npriority list. A typical list might be: hardwood veneer log (grades: prime, Select, No. 1);\nhardwood sawlogs (grade 1) and softwood sawlogs; hardwood veneer logs (grades 2 and 4);\nvarious hardwood bolt grades; hardwood sawlogs (grades 2 & 3); pulpwood; firewood.\nNOTE: If you are considering poles, contact the utility company, or Canadian Standards\nAssociation, Ottawa, with regard to specifications and handling procedures.\nFigures 13, 14 and 15 show the procedure for product-grading standing hardwood trees. There\nare no similar drawings for softwood since, as we mentioned, they are not normally graded.\nHowever, the following section does provide a number of guidelines in manufacturing logs and\nbolts, for either softwood or hardwood.\nHarvest your woodlot for a variety of products rather than a single product. This will allow you\nmore flexibility and will usually result in a higher dollar return.\nTo determine whether your product meets specifications, become familiar with the requirements\nfor each item. A number of these specifications and grading rules are provided. Also, think back\nto some of the wood properties discussed in Lessons One and Two. Some good references are\n4, 5, 7, 8 in Further Reading.\n\nFigure 13 Product grading a\nstanding hardwood tree. (Adapted\nfrom Calvert & Petro, 1993)\n\nFigure 14 Product grading a standing\nhardware tree. (Adapted from Calvert\n& Petro, 1993)\n\nFigure 15 Product grading a\nstanding hardwood tree. (Adapted\nfrom Calvert & Petro, 1993)\n\nVeneer Logs\nThere are no softwood plywood manufacturers in Nova Scotia. However, export markets\nexist. Softwood peeler log specifications vary with end product. Sheathing grade plywood has\nminimal log specifications. Decorative plywood panels; eg. white pine, require high quality logs.\nThere is a ready market for hardwood veneer logs. Three plants - one in Maine and two in New\nBrunswick - regularly purchase hardwood veneer peeler logs in Nova Scotia. Table 3 provides\nspecifications and grading rules for yellow and white birch veneer logs. Other species purchased\ninclude red maple, sugar maple, white ash, and aspen. Veneer logs usually, but not always, occur\nin the butt section of the tree. These logs must be very carefully harvested with square cuts, and\nexact lengths, and should be shipped soon after felling. Veneer buyers do not like to see\nexcessive tension wood in the log as revealed by an off-centre core.\nSawlogs\n1. Softwood - Extreme branching is not permitted and sweep, crook, and rot must be kept to a\nminimum. There is a good market for sawlogs with a sawmill within a short distance of nearly\nevery woodlot in the province. Again, when you are cutting up the stem, keep in mind other\nproducts you may wish to make. It is often easier to visualize these while the tree is standing.\nOccasionally, softwood mills buy according to log grade with a particular product in mind.\n2. Hardwood - Hardwood sawlogs have in the past often been regarded as a by-product,\nresulting from the harvesting of softwood sawlogs and pulpwood. Today a new interest in\nhardwood products seems to be pushing that notion aside. Woodlot owners are looking at\nhardwood trees in their own right and determining their best use. They are also considering the\nbest management system to enhance hardwood growth for future harvests\nIn general, the best hardwood sawlogs are in the butt section of the tree, with quality decreasing\nup the stem. It is important to assess the butt section carefully, prior to bucking up the stem.\nTable 4 provides a widely used hardwood sawlog grading system. It can serve as a guide during\nlog marking. More will be said regarding this system later.\nBoltwood\nBoltwood is defined as a section of a tree stem, 3 - 8 feet in length, normally for specialized uses.\nBolts are usually of fairly high quality and are sawn from both softwoods and hardwoods. In\nsoftwood, products include lobster trap lath, snow fence and other lath; and white pine furniture\ndimension stock. In hardwood, bolts are sawn and further processed into furniture dimension\nstock, flooring blanks or billets, dowel boards, turning squares, and frame stock. The principal\nadvantage of cutting a tree stem into short pieces is that often sweep and crook can be\nminimized. Tables 5 and 6 provide bolt specifications for a number of sawn products.\nPosts and Poles\nPosts are fairly short (8'), usually debarked, sharpened on one end, and sometimes treated with\npreservatives. In Nova Scotia, spruce and tamarack are the preferred species. They are generally\nused for fencing and represent a very local market.\nPoles are long sections (20' and up) used by telephone companies 'aria -other utilities to carry\ntransmission lines. Poles are always debarked and are pressure treated with a wood preservative.\nRed pine is the species of choice for transmission poles. The preference for red pine is due to the\nease of penetrating the sapwood with the liquid preservative, due to the nature of the cells and\ntheir interconnecting pits. Spruce, by contrast, is much more difficult to treat. Poles are structural\nproducts, carrying heavy loads and therefore, compression wood should be kept to a minimum.\n\nPulpwood\nThe forest economy of Nova Scotia in recent years has been highly dependent on harvesting\npulpwood. Almost three million cubic metres (less than one million cords) of pulpwood is\nharvested annually in the province; about 90 percent of this total in softwood species. The\nhighest grades of pulpwood are required for newsprint and therefore green material is preferred.\nPulp bolts may be recovered from most trees with the exception of those with large knots and\nexcessive cull.\nFirewood and Fuelwood\nHardwood firewood has been a saleable commodity for years. The OPEC oil embargo of the\n1960's gave this market a real boost,\nand it hasn't looked back since. This material may be produced and delivered in 8-ft lengths, or\nit may be cut into shorter lengths and split. It offers a reasonable return for the energy expended.\nIt is also a good way to use tops, and poor quality material in the stem that cannot be converted\nprofitably into more valuable products.\nFuelwood is that material destined for use as a commercial fuel. This will ultimately be in the\nform of chips, hogged wood, or as pellets. These markets are growing with the advent of wood\nburning boilers, and pellet-burning stoves.\nA number of other specialty roundwood products are listed in Lesson 5 under Markets.\nGUIDES TO MAKING BETTER LOGS AND BOLTS\nFor Sawlogs\n1. Study the log and bolt grade specifications.\n2. Know how to recognize various types of tree quality characteristics and their acceptability for\nspecific products.\n3. It is good practice to cut stumps as low as the quality of the wood will permit. Excessive butt\nflare may have to be removed from veneer logs, and is not generally acceptable in sawlogs.\n4. If at all possible, use the Humbolt undercut (see Figure 16) during felling to reduce loss due\nto shorts.\n5. In cutting back cull ends, keep butts as short as possible. Testing the butt for soundness should\nnot exceed 2-foot intervals. Jump butting or jump cutting should stop when 50 percent or less\nof the cross-sectional area contains rot.\n6. Buck logs at the grade-break or minimum diameter for the best log grade.\n7. Concentrate defective stem portions in lower grade logs (ie. portions containing\nknots, overgrown knots, insect damage, bark distortions, etc.) and clear stem portions in clear\nor higher grade logs. Follow the log and bolt grade specifications.\n8. Reduce the effect of sweep or crook by cutting a tree stem into shorter, variable length\nstraighter logs and bolts.\n9. Establish a uniform trim or broomage allowance for bucking logs - 4-inches is a safe amount.\n10. Buck forked trees to exclude the fork in the top end of the log.\n11. Remove all major log protuberances by cutting them flush with the log surface.\n12. Make all bucking cuts perpendicular to the log axis.\n13. Do not include cull sections between the ends of a log.\n14. Practice jump cutting. Such major cull indicators as stem bulges, canker type fungi, and large\nholes containing rot, should not be included in logs.\n\nFor Veneer Logs\n1. Know the veneer log grades.\n2. Focus on identifying top 3 grades, ie. 11\" and up.\n3. Learn the relative market values between hardwood\nsawlogs and veneer logs to help you decide which to\nproduce.\n4. In felling a tree containing a veneer log, it is very\nimportant to put the undercut on the stump (Humbolt);\notherwise the length of the log will be reduced during\nscaling (see Figure 16).\n5. Make all bucking cuts perpendicular to log.\n6. Measure and cut to exact log length.\n7. Become familiar with your customers' requirements; they\nmay not always be clear in the specifications.\n\nMORE INFORMATION ON ROUNDWOOD SPECIFICATIONS\nGeneral\nLearning log specifications can be a real challenge. Generally, correctly bucking up a tree stem\nis simply common sense. However, there are a few rather specific requirements, particularly in\nhardwoods.\nDiameter\nFor hardwood factory sawlogs the minimum diameter and length for grade 1 logs is 13 inches,\ninside bark (i.b.), small end, and 10 ft., respectively (butt logs only). When you look at a standing\ntree, visualize these measurements in terms of a cut log.\nFor grade 1 pine and other softwoods, 10 inches i.b., at the small end would be an equivalent\nbreaking point.\nSweep & Crook\nKeep sweep and crook to a minimum by bucking your logs at the maximum point of deviation,\nor as shown in Figure 17.\nFigures 17 to 19, taken from Reference 8 of Further Reading, show how bucking can affect\nlumber value. In these examples for hardwoods, it is assumed that all portions are being cut for\nsawlogs. For softwood logs, similar comparisons are not nearly as dramatic. The reason for this\nis the softwood lumber grades do not have such marked differences in value between grades.\nAlso softwood lumber tends to be allocated to a combination grade, such as: No. l including 15\npercent No.2. Defects, such as sweep, affect volume recovery; therefore, it is important to keep\nthese to a minimum for all sawlogs.\nNOTE: In figures 17 to 19 the author used the Ontario Log\nRule (O. L. R.) to determine volume. The O.L.R. gives slightly\nhigher overrun values than the New Brunswick Log Rule. The\nobject of the comparison, poor bucking versus good bucking\npractices, is not compromised by the log rule chosen.\n\nFigure 17- Bucking alternatives-crooked trees\n\nFigure 18- Bucking alternatives - trees with frequent knots\n\nFigure 19 -Bucking alternatives -trees requiring jump butting\n\nMEASURING ROUNDWOOD VOLUME\nGeneral\nMany woodlot owners accept their customer's measure of incoming roundwood, and are paid on\nthat basis. There is no problem with this, provided both parties are satisfied with the\narrangement. With pulpwood, there is usually no alternative. There are a number of good texts\non scaling roundwood of all kinds, particularly Further Reading 1,3.\nPulpwood\nThe major pulp and paper companies in Nova Scotia use different methods of measurement,\nwhich complicates things. One company uses stacked cubic metres, another cords, while a third\npurchases their requirements on a weight basis.\nTo determine the volume of a stack of wood 2.44m (8') in length, pile length and height\nmeasurements are taken on both sides of the stack (see Figure 20).\n\nFigure 20 - Measuring stacked pulpwood\nThe average length and height are computed from these measurements. Defects are assumed to\nextend half the bolt length and deductions are made on both sides of the pile. Heights are\nmeasured at the mid points of equal intervals.\nMaximum recommended interval is 1.5m (5').\nGross volume of a stack is calculated as follows:\nGross volume stacked (m3) _ Avg. length(m) x avg. ht.(m) x bolt length(m)\nDeductions from gross volume are made for (i) shortwood, and (ii) defects and voids. In terms\nof shortwood, measure a number of sticks to determine average bolt length. If short, you must\nadjust volume accordingly. Deducting for defects and voids is much more complicated. See the\nN.S. Scalers Manual.\nAlthough most wood in Nova Scotia is now scaled in metric units, some is still measured in\ncords. A cord is 128 cubic feet of stacked wood containing both wood and air spaces. In 8-foot\nwood a cord would be 8' (bolt length), 4' height, 4' length pile:\n(L' x W' x H)l128 = cords\nMeasuring stacked volume is similar to scaling in cubic metres. Average heights and lengths are\ntaken as before. Deductions are also made for defects, voids and short wood. Although not\nmentioned previously, all stacked wood is assumed to contain bark.\nWeight scaling is used to a limited extent in Nova Scotia and is a quick way to determine the\namount of incoming wood to a pulp yard. The truck is weighed in and weighed out, the\ndifference being the weight of wood. Companies using this method have developed relationships\nbetween weight and volume, either in cubic metres stacked or cords. Due to moisture content\n\nvariation, seasonal adjustments to the relationship may apply. Weighing automatically takes care\nof shortwood and voids; however, deduction for defective wood may still be required.\nSawlogs\nSawlogs are usually bought or sold on the basis of board feet. A board foot is, in a piece of\nlumber, a section 1-inch thick, by 1-foot long, by 1-foot wide or its equivalent in volume. In\nterms of log scale, it is the volume in board feet of lumber that the log is expected to yield during\nsawing under a fixed set of conditions.\nMany years ago, Nova Scotia adopted the New Brunswick Log Rule for scaling sawlogs. Table\n6 shows gross volumes in board feet for various diameter logs (measured inside bark at the small\nend to the last full inch) and for various lengths. Deduction for log defects are made by reducing\nscaling diameter, or scaling length, while for some defects, percentage deduction to board\nfootage is made. Because of the large number of possibilities, consult the provincial Scaling\nManual.\nMost log rules underestimate the amount of lumber produced from small logs (over-run) and\noverestimate it for larger logs (underrun). The New Brunswick rule is one of the most accurate\nrules used in Canada. Figure 21 shows the comparison of values for four log rules.\nNote how inaccurate the Doyle rule is; this is to the buyers advantage. Log rules are not good\nmeasures of sawmill efficiency because of the built-in bias, or inaccuracies noted in the figure.\nWeight scaling is also an acceptable method of determining sawlog volume. For softwood logs,\nit is estimated that between 4.76 and 5.50 metric tonnes of green softwood logs are equivalent\nto 1000 fbm as scaled by the New Brunswick rule. Corresponding values for green hardwood\nlogs are: 5.67 metric tonnes per 1000 fbm, New Brunswick scale.\n\nFigure 21 - Comparison of overrun values for four log rules.\n\nFURTHER READING\n1.

The\ndistinction between a primary product, lumber for example, and a secondary or semi-finished\nproduct, like furniture stock, may be rather small. Consequently, while our focus will be on\nprimary conversion techniques, we may occasionally refer to secondary processing to clarify the\ndescription.\nBecause there are so many conversion techniques in the industry the treatment of any particular\nprocess will be brief. The focus will be on the conversion of roundwood into solid wood\nproducts. Other items, such as panel products (particle board), pulp and paper, and sawmill\nresidue products (pellets), will be referred to briefly.\nThe Sawmill\nTraditional equipment will be described with occasional brief reference to modern, up-todate\ntechnology.\nA sawmill consists of the following pieces of equipment which have been identified on a floor\nplan (see Figure 22). A log live deck (1) brings softwood or hardwood logs to the carriage (3).\nLogs are loaded onto a carriage (3), with the assistance of a log turner (2). Logs are held firm on\nthe carriage by dogs (see Figure 23). The carriage and log pulled by a cable, runs on tracks (10),\nwith the log encountering a circular headsaw (19) along its path.\nA slab (see Figure 24A) is removed, the carriage is pulled back to its original position and the\nlog is advanced toward the sawline, through the action of the setworks, by the amount to be cut;\neg. 1 inch'. The carriage and log are again pulled through the headsaw, this time removing a\nboard with bark along each edge. The log is turned and this process is repeated until the log is\ncompletely sawn, as shown in Figure 24B. The main 8-inch thick cant is sawn on another\nmachine and will be described later.\nEdging and Trimming\nAfter the board leaves the headsaw, it falls onto a short live roll case (10) to a stop where it is\nkicked sideways onto a transfer chain (5). In some mills the roll case (10) also dips below the\nfloor surface allowing slabs to be dumped beneath the mill floor, to a chipper. The transfer chain\nconveys the board to a combination edger (6) where the two live edges are removed and the\nboard is now square-edged. Later you will note that square edge lumber is produced in one pass\nby the cant side of the combination edger (see Figure 24A). Sometimes a timber will be produced\nfrom the centre of the log (see Figure 24B). These will travel the length of the mill to a trimmer\n(16). Lumber from the edger must also travel, by conveyor, to a trimmer (13). After being\ntrimmed, lumber exits the mill and is placed in piles.\n' Actually, when the carriage setworks moves the log into the line of the saw for 1-inch lumber,\nit must also include allowance for the thickness of the headsaw (kerfi. If the saw tooth is 1/4 inch\nthick, then the advance is 1 1/4 inches. The same would apply for 2-inch lumber; eg. the set\nwould be 21/4-inches. The sawyer must always keep the saw kerf allowance in mind. When using\nan automatic carriage, as shown in Figure 23, this allowance is programmed into the setting\ndevice.\n\nFigure 22 - Schematic of a modern circular sawmill\n\nFigure 23 - Modern log carriage\n\nFigure 24 - Sawing patterns\n\nSawmill Technology\nWe have described a traditional circular sawmill which is found commonly throughout Nova\nScotia. Other headsaw options include single or double-cutting bandsaws (see Figure 26); twin\ncircular (Scragg) headrigs; twinbands or quad-bands (see Figure 27) and many other\narrangements including profiling chipper canters, frame saws, etc. Even a large chainsaw with\nan adapter kit can produce lumber. In the example, log feed is accomplished on a traditional\ncarriage (see Figure 23). In other headrig options log feed may be achieved through lug chains,\nsharp chains, alligator chains (see Figure 27) and overhead end-dogging devices. Similarly, there\nis a variety of secondary equipment, including edgers, trimmers, and resaws, commercially\navailable.\nPortable Sawmills\nIf you have a fairly large woodlot and are regularly harvesting a substantial number of sawlogs,\nyou may consider a portable band or circular sawmill. These units are gaining popularity and\nproduce excellent lumber. The band variety produces a superb surface. They are quite accurate\nwhen the saws are sharp and feed speed is kept low. The disadvantage is that they are very slow.\nGetting 2000 fbm per day from these units is really pushing it. Figure 25 shows a number of\nthese machines on the market.\nPRODUCTS OF THE SAWMILL\nLumber\nThe most important product of the sawmill is lumber. In softwood sawmills, lumber is usually\nsawn to construction grade requirements (lumber grades will be discussed in the Lesson Five).\nThis means mostly 2-inch material, such as 2 x 4, 2 x 6, 2 x 8 - in various lengths. One-inch\nmaterial is usually taken from the slab area. The 2-inch material is called dimension lumber;\nwhile one-inch is called boards. Softwood lumber is used in light construction, and most finds\nits way into wood-frame housing (see Figure 28). Examples of softwood dimension lumber\ninclude studs, joists, and rafters, while boards are used for sheathing and strapping.\nThe product of a sawmill is rough lumber. Before it is used in wood frame construction, it is\nusually dressed, four sides. Dressing is performed by high-speed planers, having four or more\ncutter heads. Dry dimension lumber (19% m.c. and lower) is dressed to 1 1⁄2 inches in thickness.\nGreen dimension lumber from the sawmill is dressed to 1 9/16 inches in thickness.\nFor those not familiar with the conversion of hardwood logs into lumber, few similarities exist\nbetween it and softwood lumber. Although the milling process may be similar (see sawing\npattern, Figure 24B) the sawmill ideally should be designed specifically for hardwoods. Little\nhardwood is used for light frame construction. Hardwood, or factory lumber is principally used\nin remanufacturing, or secondary manufacturing, and is cut up into other products.\nFactory lumber is usually cut up into shorter, narrower pieces, while softwood lumber is usually\nused as is. It is graded in a different way than softwood. Strength is not generally as important\nin hardwood as appearance. In most applications, defects (knots, bark, holes, etc.) are removed\nto obtain a clear cutting. Clear cuttings will be discussed in more detail later on.\nA large percentage of sawn hardwood lumber is used by the furniture industry. Figure 29 shows\na hardwood board of medium grade, No.2 Common. When the furniture plant receives this board\nit cuts out the defects to produce clear cuttings. These cuttings are then glued into panels\n(cuttings of the same length and thickness but random widths), which are then machined and\nassembled into a piece of furniture.\nAn important feature of this production process is the utilization of short lengths. Eighty-five\npercent of all furniture parts are less than 4-feet in length. As a result many furniture companies\nsaw only short logs (3 to 7 ft) in their sawmills. Today, many more purchase part of their\nrequirements as dimension stock rather than long lumber.\n\nFigure 25 - Examples of portable band and circular sawmills\n\nFigure 26 -Single-cutting band headsaw\n\nFigure 27 - Twin-band scragg headrig\n\nFigure 28 - Wood frame construction\n\nFigure 29 - Cutting layout for No. 2 Common\n\nDimension stock\nDimension stock is a cut-to-size, wood component normally kiln-dried, usually one-inch in\nthickness (4/4), that is supplied by a plant other than the furniture manufacturer. Do not confuse\nhardwood dimension stock, with softwood dimension lumber. In softwoods the term `dimension'\nalways refers to the thickness of the material; ie. 2-inches (8/4) and up. One of the most common\ntypes of primary break-down machines to produce dimension stock is the short-log bolter (Figure\n30). These machines, however, are gradually being replaced by short-log carriages - specifically\ndesigned for bolts 3 - 8 ft. in length. Dimension stock may also be produced from standard\nfactory lumber.\nOther Softwood Products\nWhile construction lumber is certainly the most important product sawn from softwood logs,\nmany others find good markets. Most of these fall into the category of `remanufactured products'\nor as is known in the trade, simply `reman'. Examples include:\n1. ladder rails: No compression wood; straight; rate of growth must be about 6 rings per inch;\nmaximum slope of grain is 1 in 12; knots are generally not permitted; no rot; maximum moisture\ncontent - 15 percent; these are manufactured to customers' sizes; Wooden ladders are still widely\nused, particularly by utility companies, since they are less of a hazard in transmitting electrical\ncurrent. Most ladder rails are made from West Coast species, but other softwood species may be\nused.\n2. moulding stock: This material, in a variety of lengths, widths, and thicknesses, is used to make\ninterior and exterior mouldings used in house construction. It includes quarter round, half round,\ncrown, cornice and many other patterns. Softwood mouldings are usually painted, although some\nspecies such as white pine and spruce are given a natural finish.\nMoulding stock must be free of defect, usually straight-grained, the mouldings themselves must\nbe free of dressing skips and similar imperfections. Mouldings are produced on a multi-head\nmoulder.\n3. other millwork: Mouldings are usually classified as millwork. This category also includes\nhandrails, stair treads, window sashes and frames, picture frames and others. Many of these\nproducts require a high proportion of long lengths which is being met increasingly by fingerjointing. In this process, short clear pieces of lumber are end-glued into long continuous strips.\nWhite pine, aspen, and clear spruce are excellent species for millwork.\n4. furniture: This industry is based primarily on hardwoods. However, furniture is also\nmanufactured from softwood species. White pine - because it was plentiful and very easy to work\n- was a favourite furniture wood of the early settlers. In the last 15 to 20 years, there has been a\nstrong renewed demand for white pine furniture. Much of this has been in the form of\nreproductions of the early `Canadiana' designs. Other softwood species used for furniture include\ncedar, larch, Jack pine and red pine. Some very interesting designs can be found in furniture from\nthese species, particularly in the finishing techniques used. The grade requirements for softwood\nfurniture sometimes follow those of hardwood, that is, clear cuttings. However, rustic pine\nfurniture is manufactured that incorporates knots, colour variations, bark pockets, etc., providing\na very pleasing effect.\nProducts from Low Grade Hardwoods\nClear hardwood stock for furniture and other products was covered earlier. Another type of\nfurniture component is called frame stock, which is used in (1) the upholstered furniture\nindustry as the frame to which upholstery is stapled and (2) as the interior frames of cabinets and\nother pieces of furniture. Hidden within the finished product,\n\nFigure 30 - Short-log bolter\n\nframe stock needs only be strong enough to perform its function. It is usually selectively\nrecovered from the lower grades of lumber. Its main feature is market price, up to three times that\nof pallet stock, with which it competes. However, pallet stock can also be a good outlet for lowgrade material. Furthermore, pallet lumber can be easily upgraded into cut-to-size pallet stock,\nready to nail. Prices for pallet stock are generally low but there is a fairly good market in Nova\nScotia.\nSAWING PATTERNS\nSoftwood\nThe `traditional' mill, you may recall, has a combination edger. This means it can handle boards\nand dimension on one side, and cants on the other. In the example shown in Figure 24A, the\nsoftwood log is being `cant sawn'. Boards and dimension are removed on the headsaw from\nopposite faces until an 8-inch thick cant is made. The cant is then kicked off the carriage and\nmakes its way to the cant side of the edger. In one pass the cant is sawn into about 6 pieces of\n2 x 8.\nThe material in the two-slab portions of the cant can be sawn, into boards and dimension lumber\nrequiring edging. Or the slabs (thick) can be directed to a resaw (not shown) further down the\nline. Speed is of the essence. The quicker the log can be processed and removed from the\ncarriage (to receive the next log), the higher the production.\nHardwood\nTwo sawing patterns (see Figure 24B) are shown for hardwoods. In B 1, the log is completely\n\ncut up on the carriage into boards. (We might have sawn some 2-inch stock as well.) The cutting\nlines in the figure show the log was turned many times. This is called turning for grade and is\nthe accepted method of sawing quality hardwood. This way sawing continues on a face until\ndefects are encountered.\nThe log is turned to a new face and sawn until defects occur on that face - and so on. Usually,\nwhen all faces are showing defects, the remainder of the log is quickly cut into whatever it will\nyield.\nIn B2, the log has also been turned frequently for grade but the centre portion has been reserved\nfor production of a timber (or tie, mine pack, pallet cant, etc.). The production of timbers\nincreases productivity somewhat. The down-side is that the timber may contain potentially high\nquality lumber on one or more of its faces.\nLUMBER DRYING\nAir-drying\nBefore lumber is used, it should be dried. As a minimal requirement, air drying should be carried\nout. Building codes usually allow a maximum of 19 percent m.c. which can be easily obtained\nby air-drying during the summer. Air-drying requires holding lumber inventories for lengthy\nperiods.\nTo air-dry lumber effectively, the piles must be prepared carefully. Stickers between each course\nof lumber must be placed accurately across the pile, and they must be lined-up accurately with\nrespect to pile height. Ideally, the top of the pile should be capped by a slanted piece of plywood\nto shed rain.\nPiles should be located so their length is at right angles to prevailing wind direction to improve\nthe flow of dry air through the courses in the pile.\nPre-drying\nPre-drying is usually carried out on lumber that will eventually be kiln-dried. The techniques can\nbe elaborate or very simple. The simplest method uses a large fan to direct outside air through\nthe pile. The process is done only on warm, dry days and the only energy required is for the fan.\nDepending on outside temperature and humidity, pre-drying can quickly reduce the moisture\ncontent of green lumber.\nKiln-drying\nBefore installing and operating a kiln, read extensively on the subject. More important, attend\none of the many kiln-drying short courses such as those offered by the Maritime Forest Ranger\nSchool in Fredericton.\nThere are many types of dry kilns on the market. Only steam kilns and dehumidification kilns\nwill be discussed. But first, the drying process will be discussed to see what is required and what\nthe dangers are.\nHow Wood Dries\nMoisture is mainly removed at the wood surface by evaporation. To obtain good evaporation\nconditions, the surrounding air must be dry enough to absorb the water at the surface. To speed\nup the process heat is applied to the wood, and with fans, increase the movement of air across\nits surface.\nMoisture Gradients and Shrinkage\nIn the early stages of kiln-drying the following happens: (1) moisture is rapidly lost at the surface\nin a shell (see Figure 31); (2) a moisture gradient is set up between the shell and interior; (3) the\n\nshell dries below fsp and begins to shrink; (4) the interior, or core, does not shrink because its\nm.c. is still very high; (5) thus, the shell tries to become smaller (stretch) around a core that\nresists this shrinkage; (6) stresses are set up in the shell (as if a piece of rubber was stretched\naround the core); and (7) if the stresses are great enough, the shell cracks. These cracks are called\nseasoning checks (see Figure 10) and can permanently damage the wood. In oak, for example,\nwith its large rays, checks develop along these lines of weakness.\nHow to Prevent Checking\nTo prevent severe checking, fairly mild conditions must be used during the early stage of drying.\nThis means keeping temperature low and humidity high. Eventually, the drying shell becomes\n`set' in its stretched state. Once this point is reached, drying conditions can be `turned up'.\nTemperature may be increased which causes the relative humidity to fall, and more rapid drying\nto begin.\nCompleting the Kiln-drying Process\nDuring the kiln-drying process, temperature is gradually increased, and humidity is continually\nlowered. Increasing the heat causes more rapid drying and in the late stages this overcomes the\nincreasing difficulty of removing the moisture. What usually happens, referring back to Figure\n31, is the moisture gradient remains. This may cause trouble later in furniture (for example) if\nthe core area dries and shrinks. To overcome this, wood is usually over dried slightly, and then\nconditioned. Moisture is introduced and absorbed back in the shell and the cross-section reaches\na constant moisture content. Drying stresses are relieved by this type of conditioning.\nThe Steam Kiln\nThis type of kiln is most common in the industry (although perhaps not in Nova Scotia). A boiler\nproduces steam heat transferred through vaned-pipes to the kiln. Reversible fans move air\nthrough the lumber courses. Conditions within the kiln are governed by remote controllerrecorders, which respond to a pre-set schedule. A wet bulb thermometer, covered by a cloth\nwick, measures humidity. The difference between the dry and wet bulb thermometer readings the depression - is a measure of the ability of the air to evaporate moisture from the wood\nsurface.\nThe Dehumidification Kiln\nThe dehumidification kiln has gained favour in recent years, largely because of its efficiency and\nit can be tailored to almost any capacity. In this type of kiln, moisture is drawn from the air in\nthe kiln and condensed on cold evaporator coils, where it `gives up its heat'. This heat, in turn,\nis transferred to the refrigerant fluid causing it to vaporize. Vapour is cycled through the\ncompressor where additional heat (the friction generated by the compressor) is picked up. At this\npoint, the hot vapour is passed through the condenser where it gives up its heat to the dry kiln\nair. The vapour (refrigerant) then reverts back to the liquid state. Heat is generated and recycled\ncontinuously. Today, most dehumidification kilns have auxiliary heat sources that can be used\nfor short periods, to bring the charge up to temperature initially and for increasing temperature\nquickly at other times - particularly during winter conditions.\nGLUED PRODUCTS\nVeneer\nSoftwood and hardwood veneer may be produced by: (i) sawing (very thin-kerf saw); (ii) slicing\nflitches, and by (iii) peeling round logs and bolts. The last process, peeling, is the most common\nfor Canadian species. For very specialized applications, where the decorative features are most\n\nimportant, sawing or slicing must be used.\nVeneer is peeled in long, more or less continuous, ribbons on a veneer lathe (see Figure 32).\nLogs that have been `conditioned' by soaking in hot water are charged into the lathe and\nchucked. The log turns, while the veneer knife engages the log. The knife is moved continuously\nand automatically inward as the log becomes ever smaller in diameter. The veneer `flows' on to\nconveyors where it is clipped into sheets, defects are removed, and it is finally dried in a veneer\nkiln or drier while still moving on line.\nPlywood\nIn some cases veneer is the final product. However, many plants also operate a plywood\nmanufacturing facility. Standard size plywood panels are 4 ft. x 8 ft. In making up the typical\nsandwich construction of plywood, plies are always `balanced'. This means that on each side of\nthe central core of veneer, an equal number of plies are added, the last on one side being the\nfinish or decorative face; while on the opposite a lower quality face. Total plies are always an\nodd number; eg. 3, 5, 7, 9 and so on. This is because of grain orientation. Beginning with the\ncore (except for 3-ply panels) grain is oriented along the length of the panel (8'), the next two\nplies run at right-angles to the core (consequently these sheets are only 4' in length, but 8' in\nwidth). In all cases the two outside veneer plies are oriented along the length of the panel. During\nassembly of the panel, glue is applied to each sheet. The loose panel is then placed in a hotpress,\nwhere the adhesive is cured.\nBoard or Panel Products\nThere are many panel products on the market which utilize both residues from other operations;\neg. sawmill, as well as under-used species. One of the more recent developments in this category\nis oriented strand board (OSB) which is made up of flakes or strands similar to the manufacture\nof waferboard (Aspenite). The main difference is that OSB aligns the component strands in such\na way as to impart strength as desired - it is an engineered product. The strands may all be\naligned in the same direction to provide strength along the board, similar to a laminated product.\nOr, as is usually the case, strands are aligned in layers in alternating 90 degree angles to each\nother providing strength along and across the board, similar to sheathing grade plywood, with\nwhich it competes.\n\nFigure 31 - Cross section of drying wood (early stage) showing moisture gradient\n\nFigure 32 - Schematic of Veneer lathe and peeler log\n\nOther Panel products\nThese include waferboard, particle board, conventional fibre board, medium density fibre board\n(mdf), and others. There are also a number of composite panel products using a decorative\nveneer over a particle board core. While similar in many respects, each of these products is\nmanufactured differently using techniques that impart the special properties required. See\nFurther Reading.\nPulp and Paper\nGreat strides have been made in pulp and paper manufacture, including the recycling of used\npaper products. The development of thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) for newsprint is perhaps\nthe most important advance in recent years. TMP uses large amounts of heat energy as opposed\nto mechanical energy required by stone groundwood, which it has all but replaced. The chipped\nwood, after being heated for a lengthy period, is fed to a disc refiner which separates the\nindividual fibres, or cells. The resulting pulp is much stronger than groundwood. Therefore, it\nrequires the addition of little chemical pulp to meet strength and other properties required for\nnewsprint. In time, chemical pulps may be eliminated in the newsprint industry. Largely because\nof its size, this industry has had to adjust perhaps more than any other to environmental\npressures, resulting in the development of less toxic refining and bleaching processes.\nWOOD RESIDUES\nWood residues include those generated in the forest during harvesting, and those generated at\nprimary and secondary manufacturing plants.\nForest Residues\nResidues such as tops, roots and stumps, and defective stems represent huge volumes of biomass usually left in the woods. This material provides a source of soil nutrients for future\n\ngrowing stock. On average, this volume is estimated to be around 50 percent of the total stand.\nIn some operations, where fulltree logging is carried out, almost all aboveground material is\nchipped and used.\nPlant Residues\nThe average small circular or rotary sawmill recovers only about half (50 percent) of the wood\nvolume of each log in the form of lumber. Up to 16 percent may be converted into sawdust,\nwhile 34% may be in the form of slabs, edgings, and trim-ends. Bark may represent up to about\n14 per cent of total tree volume. The net lumber component for softwoods is further reduced\nwhen the lumber is dressed. As mentioned, hardwoods are usually sold rough.\nIn softwoods, the planing mill will produce large volumes of shavings and further amounts of\nsawdust if resawing is practised. In hardwood plants, the residue will be in the form of dry\nsawdust, edgings, trim ends, and shavings.\nUses for Wood Residues\nMost softwood sawmills convert about a third of solid residues into pulp chips. These are\nshipped to the nearest mill where they form an excellent pulp furnish. However, hardwood\nsawmills often cannot economically take advantage of this market. Only one pulp mill in the\nprovince accepts hardwood sawmill chips for pulp furnish.\nFuel pellets, and the stoves that are designed to burn them, have become very popular lately. To\nbe economically attractive the plant must gear up for a modest production - often beyond the\ncapacity of a single sawmill or secondary plant's residue.\nMany sawmills, dry-kiln operators, and secondary plants use their residue to heat their plants and\nfire the boilers for dry kilns. However, most sawmills produce more fuel capacity than they can\nuse. Co-generation power plants built in locations central to a source of wood fuel are another\noption for utilizing residue. The mill, or plant, receives all the heat it needs and disposes of the\nsurplus to the power utility grid at a profit.\nA number of hardwood sawmills have installed relatively inexpensive slab saws which\nautomatically cut up slabs and edgings into stove lengths. These, together with trim ends, are\nsold by the truck load around the countryside. This provides a ready cash product to such\nproducers and they do not have to rely on the fluctuations of the pulp chip market.\nSawdust, shavings, and bark have been used for many years as animal bedding, poultry litter,\nagricultural mulch, and other similar uses. Indeed, by using simple treating processes, wood can\nbe transformed into a diet supplement for farm animals.\nWe have already mentioned some panel and board products that can use a certain amount of\nsawdust as raw material. A product called wood flour was very popular and is still being shipped\nto producers of moulded plastics. Wood flour is used as a neutral extender or bulking agent.\n\nFURTHER READING\n1. Anon.

In this lesson the focus is on the products recovered from these logs. Markets for\nroundwood and converted products are also covered. Please keep in mind, however, that market\ninformation - especially prices - can become obsolete very quickly.\nMARKETING WOOD PRODUCTS\nPulpwood\nIf you are a member of a group venture or a producer's association, you will have access to\ncurrent marketing information. Otherwise, you may negotiate your own deal with the pulp mill\npurchasing representative. Periodically, there is a good export market for pulpwood from Nova\nScotia in both hardwoods and softwoods. For a list of brokers dealing in export pulpwood, refer\nto publication No. I on the Further Reading list.\nHardwood Veneer Logs\nIn 1995 the following firms purchase hardwood veneer logs:\n(1) Columbia Forest Products, Indian Head Division, P.O. Box 848, Presque Isle, Maine, U.\nS.A. 04769. 1-207-764-4428\n(2) Veneer Products of New Brunswick 1981 Ltd. Napadogan, N.B. EOH IEO.\n1-506-367-2574\n(3) McAdam Plywood & Veneer Products Ltd. McAdam, N.B. EOH lK0.\n1-506-784-2227\nFor first-time sales, these companies will often send their buyers to your location. This provides\nyou with hands-on experience in grading veneer logs which may avoid costly rejection at their\nyards.\nSawlogs\nA listing of sawmills in the province is provided in publication No. 1, on the Further Reading\nlist.\nOther roundwood products include studwood (8' softwood logs), fence posts, poles, fuel wood,\nand pallet logs.\nSpecialty Products\nThis category includes roundwood destined for very specific applications, such as musical\ninstruments and turned products. Markets are usually small but very rewarding, especially when\nthe product is in short supply. The following provides a brief description of both the round\nproduct, and its' converted format.\n1. Bolts (or flitches) for musical instruments\nBoth straight-grained spruce and sugar maple are in demand. Spruce is used for guitar sounding\nboards, while sugar maple is used in building fiddles and violins. Special grain patterns in sugar\nmaple, such as curly grain, and fiddle-back grain are preferred and command high prices. In\n1995, two Nova Scotia instrument makers are:\n1. Nicholas Tipney Oldtree Instruments\nRussia Road, Black Rock\nKings Co., N. S.\nBOP IVO 1-902-53 8-3271.\n\n2.\n\nOtis A. Tomas\nMeadow North River,\nVictoria Co., N. S. BOE I BO.\n1-902-929-2766.\n\n2. Bolts for shakes and shingles\nThere are no firms manufacturing split shakes in Nova Scotia. Reference No. I at the end of this\nLesson cites 12 shingle manufacturers. Shingles are produced from short (18\") bolts of spruce,\nfir, pine, and poplar preferably with no knots and straight grained.\n3. Cooperage bolts\nThese are tree sections (bolts) destined for the manufacture of barrels and kegs. `Slack cooperage'\n(barrels and kegs used for dry or bulk goods) are manufactured in Nova Scotia. The staves and\nheadings may be of almost any species, unless food-stuffs are to be packaged. Aspen and spruce\nare preferred species for some slack barrels and kegs, particularly those used for decorative\npurposes (flower pots and plants). Reference No. 1 cites three manufacturers in the province.\n4. Spool wood bolts\nSpool wood was the common industry term for 4-foot white birch bolts, destined to be converted\ninto squares and subsequently turned into spools and bobbins, and other products. Plastics have\ncut into the market for spools but many other wood turnings are still very much in demand. Sugar\nmaple, yellow birch, and other species are now being used in this market. The turning industry\nitself is largely concentrated in New England, particularly in Maine.\nOther specialty products are listed below.\nBirds eye maple - occurs predominately in sugar maple, and frequently in red maple. This\npoorly understood figure has fascinated people for years. Wood containing birdseye commands\na high price. It is especially prized for the manufacture of small wooden containers, furniture\nsuch as coffee and end tables, and cabinets. Birds eye veneer is similarly in demand. In this case\nthe veneer is either sawn or sliced from flitches. If you can recognize birds eye in the standing\ntree, and you have enough of it, get in touch with buyers of specialty products such as those listed\nin the yellow pages of the Halifax directory .\nCurly and fiddleback maple - this has also been referred to earlier in relation to musical instrument makers. Curly maple is also in demand for the same products listed for birds eye. A great\ndeal of birds eye and curly maple is salvaged from firewood piles. Fiddle makers often obtain\nmuch of their requirements in this way.\nSporting goods and related products - small industries, producing a variety of sporting goods,\nrequire wood with special qualities. Hockey sticks, for example, require white ash handle and\nrock elm blade. The method of bonding the handle and blade requires specialized machinery.\nBaseball bats are also produced from white ash. Initially, the blanks or squares are sawn on a\nbolter to obtain straight grain - the major requirement. Squares are then turned on a multispindle\nlathe from a steel pattern. The ash should have at least six annual rings per inch for bats.\nBowling pins - made from hard maple. Small, Canadian type pins are turned from a one-piece\nblank, while the larger pins are made up from laminated blanks. Bowling pins are finished with\na high-resistant plastic coating.\n\nBilliard, pool and snooker cues - are usually made from hard maple from straight-grained\nblanks. These are turned on back knife lathes. Specifications for cue-stock are very high as is\nmarket price.\nWood turning, general - bats, cues, and pins have already been noted. There are hundreds of\nother uses for turned goods from plain, round dowels to complicated cross-sections. Turnings\nwith round cross-sections are turned on lathes of the kind described. Turnings that are not round\nin cross-section (axe handle), and which may also depart from a straight long axis (chair legs,\nFrench Provincial) are turned on a shaping lathe. In these lathes, the wood blank turns very\nslowly, while a rotating cutter-head is brought to bear against the piece. The cutter head, in turn,\nfollows a similarly slowly turning steel pattern.\nSawn Products\nDomestic - There are various ways to handle sales. Softwood lumber can be sold dressed, or\nrough, green. Well manufactured lumber can usually be sold in rough form to a lumber company.\nThey will put it through their planing mill and sell it along with their own material.\nFinally, you can sell direct. This means selling softwood lumber to (i) a retail yard or (ii) to a\nuser such as a house construction firm.\nHardwood lumber can be sold the same way with one important exception. In the hardwood trade\n(not including hardwood retailers selling to small cabinet shops, etc.) lumber is always sold\nrough. There are a number of hardwood brokers and wholesalers in the yellow pages of the\ntelephone directory.\nExport - Few people are in a position to export lumber out of Canada. Nonetheless, export\nmarkets are described briefly. Softwood lumber to be exported to Europe must be kilndried or\notherwise heat-treated to satisfy sanitation requirements. This is not required for the U.S. The\nbest course of action is to sell to one of the lumber firms that do export. They will dry the lumber\nin their kilns, and do all the paper work required to prove drying (sanitation) took place.\nSome subtle differences exist when exporting hardwood lumber. You can put up fairly small\nquantities of kiln dried lumber for export to Europe. Hardwood lumber for export is often in the\nhigher grades - No. 1 Common and Better - and is shipped either in a container or well wrapped\nand strapped, as break-bulk. Lists of agents and importers appear in reference No. 2, Further\nReading. To export hardwood lumber to the U. S. you should contact one of their importers or\nwholesalers. To get appropriate names to refer to the yellow pages for Boston, or New York. A\nbetter way is to contact the Office of Nova Scotia in New England, through the Economic\nRenewal Agency in Halifax.\nOther Wood Products\nOther wood products were listed earlier under the collective heading `reman'. These include\nhardwood dimension stock, mouldings, trim, window cases, and virtually all the architectural\nmillwork - both softwood and hardwood. There is a large domestic and export market for reman\nand cut-up stock. Listings for both domestic and export possibilities are in Further Reading.\nGRADING WOOD PRODUCTS\nTo sell something as variable as wood, requires specifications that are understandable and consistent. In the 1800's, large North American lumber producers developed their own grading rules.\nIn many cases the grades developed in one region bore little resemblance to those from another\nregion. The market, such as it was, tended to be chaotic.\nAt the onset of World War II, North American industry began gearing up for a major conflict,\nrequiring an all out effort to produce war materiel. This huge effort provided the impetus to\n\nstandardize grading specifications for most wood products, of which lumber and plywood were\nmajor items. Eventually these efforts toward standardization led to the formation of national\nauthorities charged with producing and administering grading rules. These thrusts to standardize\nwere coordinated between the U.S. and Canada, resulting in few differences in present-day\ngrading specifications between the two countries.\nNational Lumber Grades Authority (NLGA)\nThe NLGA was incorporated under the federal Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs\nin 1971, to deal with all species and grading rules in Canada. Its membership includes all\nregional lumber inspection agencies such as the Maritime Lumber Bureau. The NLGA turned\nover supervision of grading to the Canadian Lumber Standards (CLS) Division of the Canadian\nStandards Association.\nThe CLS is responsible for establishing policy and control of grade marking Canadian lumber,\nthrough a variety of boards or bureaus. It should be mentioned that the formation of the NLGA,\nand CLS, was primarily- to ensure safety in the application of softwood lumber. Except for the\npoplars, it does not apply to hardwoods. The grading rule then, for softwoods throughout Canada,\nis the `Standard Grading Rules for Canadian Lumber'.\nSoftwood Lumber Grade Basics\nSince most softwood lumber is used `as is' it must be graded with that in mind. For example, a\npiece of dressed lumber, 2\" x 10\" by 12-feet in length (nominal dimensions) will probably be\nused as a joist or rafter. The following describes a typical softwood lumber grade:\nNo. 1 - Structural light framing (2\" - 4\" wi de - Checks - checks on the ends are limited to a\nlength equal to the width of the piece; knots - sound, firm, encased, and pith knots if tight and\nwell-spaced, are permitted in sizes not to exceed the following:\n\nKNOTS\nwidth of piece\n\nat edge\n\ncentreline\n\nunsoundknots & holes\n\n2\"\n\n1⁄2\"\n\n1⁄2\"\n\n1⁄2\"\n\n3\"\n\n3/4\"\n\n3/4\"\n\n3/4\"\n\n4\"\n\n1\"\n\n1 1⁄2\"\n\n1\"\n\nShakes - on ends, limited to half the thickness. Away from ends, several heart shakes up to 2'\nlong, none through.\nSlope of grain - 1 in 10\nSplits - as for checks\nStain - firm\nWane - 1/4 the thickness, 1/4 the width. 5 percent of pieces may have wane up to 1⁄2 thickness\nand 1 /3 width, for 1 /4 length.\nThe above is just one of many softwood lumber grades and categories. It is shown to illustrate\nthe concept that the piece is graded with its strength (in this case as a stud or for minor framing)\nin mind. Again, it is to be used `as is'. It is often called a `defect grading system'.\n\nHardwood Lumber Grade Basics\nThe grading of hardwood lumber and related products evolved differently over the years. The\nimpetus for establishing uniform, national grades for hardwoods came primarily from the United\nStates. These developments culminated in the formation of the National Hardwood Lumber\nAssociation (NHLA), based in Memphis, Tennessee. The NHLA publish and periodically update\nthe applicable grading rules `Rules for the Measurement and Inspection of Hardwood and\nCypress'. The NHLA rules are recognized world wide and, interestingly, have not been converted\nto metric units. They are published in many languages.\nHardwood is graded on an entirely different system than softwood lumber. Factory lumber is\nintended to be cut up into components. Usually, these components must be clear - free from all\ndefects. These are called \"clear cuttings\" system and can be considered in the same way as\ndescribed for the production of dimension stock. Hardwood grades are based on the yield of clear\ncuttings (yield being expressed as percentage of the area of the board). However, the width,\nlength, and number of cuttings permitted also comes into play.\nCutting unit method - In determining yield, the cutting unit method is used. A cutting unit is\none inch by one foot. The number of units in a clear cutting is found by multiplying width (in\ninches), by length (in feet). Use fractions if necessary in both width and length. In actual grading,\nthe total cutting units for all clear cuttings is obtained and compared with the `yield' requirement\nfor the grade. Table 7 shows cutting requirements for standard grades.\n\nAdditional Specifications\nIn addition to grades many wood products have parallel specifications such as standards and\ncodes to govern their use. Standards are the grading rules just discussed as well as others dealing\nwith safety, strength, etc. Codes are legal documents that require products to be manufactured\naccording to certain standards. The National Building Code (NBC), for example, sets out\nminimum standards for construction, and is `legal' to the extent that its provisions are mandatory\nfor all construction financed under the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. If a province\nadopts the NBC then it is a legal code for all light frame construction within the province. Nova\nScotia adopted the NBC in 1987.\nThe Canadian Standards Association (CSA) publishes standards for all types of products in\nCanada. There are two standards for wood; one for softwood lumber, and one for the\n\"Engineering Design of Wood\". The CSA authorizes the Canadian Lumber Standards\nAccreditation Board for monitoring all softwood lumber grade marking in Canada.\nThe Underwriters' Laboratories of Canada (ULC) develops and publishes standards, and\nspecifications for products that relate to fire or accident hazards or crime prevention. Through\nits laboratory it also provides certification and testing services for fire-retardant treatments and\npressure treating facilities for wood products.\nENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS\nThere is no human endeavour today that does not come under the scrutiny of the environmental\nmovement. For the most part this is a good thing because all of our activities impact on the\nenvironment. Only when this scrutiny unfairly limits our ability to do business do we object.\nForestry has come under particularly heavy attention from environmentalist activists.\nClear cutting, the use of herbicides and insecticides, and other forestry practices are under fire.\nSo how does this relate to the utilization of wood?\nThere is a trend in Europe, and to a lesser extent, North America, to examine the `forestry' behind\neach product being sold. Who is doing the examining? It began with the environmental\nmovement, but today individual firms - furniture companies, large importers of softwood lumber,\nand consumer organizations - are taking on this task. Some believe that consumers have\neffectively shut down the tropical hardwood industry. We do know that in the hardwood trade,\nthe switch from tropical (dark coloured) to temperate (light coloured) hardwoods has been\nmonumental. The huge softwood lumber industry has not escaped either. Buyers question the\npractices of all Canadian suppliers, especially those from British Columbia.\nOne area of concern focuses on the habitat for wildlife in the forest environment. Nova Scotia\nhas joined other provinces in developing forest/wildlife guidelines and standards to be\nimplemented on Crown lands. Where possible these guidelines should also be practiced on\nprivate lands by incorporating these standards in your forest management programs. The\nguidelines include practical techniques to enhance wildlife habitat and recommendations on\nforest diversity (age, openings, cutting areas), establishment of wildlife corridors and edges,\nmanagement of forest adjacent to water courses, protection of cavity trees for birds and small\nmammals, and other common sense practices. Fish habitat is also an area that should be\naddressed in this context. A comprehensive publication (No. 8, Further Reading) provides\nwoodlot owners with information on selection, location, and construction of stream crossings\nto protect fish habitat.\n\nHow can owners of woodlots and producers of primary and secondary wood products respond\nto these forces? Each of you must decide where you stand on the issues. In the long run your\ndecisions and actions will affect how you do business.\nA standards certification agency will be responsible for determining whether your products have\noriginated from a sustainably managed forest. Sound far-fetched? Not so! It's happening as this\nis being written. To sell wood, certain standards of conduct will have to be met. Plan on it!\nTHE FUTURE OF WOOD\nWood is one of Canada's major resources, and if not the largest in terms of industrial activity,\ncertainly near the top. Nova Scotia's economy depends significantly on what the future brings\nfor this huge renewable resource.\nWill wood products maintain their position in the next century?\nWorld population is predicted to increase steadily. Under-developed third world nations are\nstriving for better standards of living for existing populations. Thus, it would appear that the\nmarket for wood products will keep on growing.\nThere are also world wide movements aimed at reducing the by-products of human activity garbage. These would substitute bio-degradable materials like wood for plastics and metals,\nespecially in `throw-away' items like packaging. Wood is also making a come back for certain\nindustrial uses. Replacement of carpeting by wood flooring is an example. In Canada, woodframe housing is taken for granted. But the traditional house building material in a large part of\nthe world is masonry and metal. We believe wood will form a greater content of houses,\nworldwide, in the future. Even feeding a growing world population may have an impact on wood\nuse since cellulose - the basic constituent of wood - can be converted into food for both animals\nand humans.\nNonetheless, while it appears the forests of the world will be called upon to produce even greater\nvolumes of wood products, a parallel force suggests that forests and wildlands be used for\nactivities and purposes other than wood production. This is not only an environmental\nmovement. As people have more time for leisure activities many would like to see more space\nset aside where they can enjoy these activities.\nEven though we may be sorry for industry, we still ask politicians to have these areas set aside.\nMost only want to see them reserved as wilderness to protect the downstream effect such as\nwater levels and water quality in streams and lakes, where we angle for salmon and trout. The\namount of forested land to be taken out of production in the future will be large. Furthermore,\nforestry practices on remaining lands will be ever more closely scrutinized. Smaller cuts will be\nthe rule.\nAre these incompatible trends? First, the problem is not as simple as the one we have described.\nMany more factors such as technology come into play. Trends can also change. Forecasting can\nbe a risky business. In 1952, the Stanford Research Institute, a world renowned organization,\nforecast the demand for forest products in the U. S. by the year 1975. As it happened, they\nunderestimated demand by 200% for plywood, 50% for pulpwood; and gave no estimate at all\nfor other panel products - which by 1975 was a huge industry.\nTo sum up, the production of forest products will increase to meet increased demands. The\nincreased production will be from a smaller land base. More fibre per hectare will be grown by\ndoing better forest management on more of the available land. Converting these managed trees\nto products will become much more sophisticated.\n\nThe production of lumber will gradually decrease. In its place will be wood-based building\nproducts including joists and studs, and other structural members, extruded from our composite\nmaterial feed stock. True wood, as we know it, with its pleasing grain and colour and other\nattributes, may be reserved for decorative purposes only.\nFURTHER READING\n1.

The rays serve primarily to store\nfood and transport it horizontally through the tree.\nreaction wood: Wood with abnormal structure and properties formed in parts of leaning or\ncrooked stems and in branches. In hardwoods it is called 'tension wood'; in softwoods, 'compression wood'.\nrelative density: Formerly called specific gravity. As applied to wood, the ratio of the oven-dry\nweight of a sample to the weight of a volume of water equal to the volume of the sample at\nspecified moisture content (green, air-dry, or oven-dry).\nresaw: A sawing machine used to break down cants into lumber, for recovering lumber from\nslabs, and for upgrading lumber by ripping off defective portions.\nresin ducts: Intercellular canals or passages that contain and transmit resinous materials. They\nmay extend vertically parallel to the axis of the tree or at right angles to the axis and parallel to\nthe rays.\nring-porous: Used in referring to a group of hardwoods in which the annual growth layers\nconsist of a more or less continuous zone or large earlywood pores that changes relatively\nabruptly to a denser latewood zone having smaller pores and an abundance of fibrous tissue (e.g.,\noak and ash).\nring shake: A separation along the grain that occurs most commonly between adjoining annual\nlayers.\nrotary-cut veneer: Veneer cut in a lathe that rotates a log or bolt gainst a knife set in such a\nmanner as to peel off a continuous thin sheet.\nrough lumber: Lumber that has been sawn, edged, and trimmed but not dressed (planed).\nrupture: Means the point at which wood fails in response to an applied load (see also modulus\nof rupture).\nsap: Fluid contents of the living wood cells.\nsapwood: The wood located near the outside of the tree stem containing the tissues actively\ninvolved in the transport of sap. It is generally lighter in colour than heartwood and has lower\nnatural resistance to decay.\n\nsawing around: Breaking down a log by turning it on the carriage of a headsaw to obtain the\nbest yield of lumber from the clear outer portion of the log.\nsawn veneer: Veneer produced by sawing.\nscrag saw: Two or more pairs of saws, one pair to a drive shaft, or two or more pairs of saws,\neach saw on an individual drive shaft, all sawing different lines. Saws may be fixed or adjustable\nto different settings.\nsetworks: The mechanism on an edger, on a log carriage, or on twin and quad bandsaws for\nregulating the thickness of the wood being cut.\nshake: A rupture or separation along the grain. The term is most commonly applied to 'ring\nshakes', which develop tangentially either within a given annual layer or at the boundary between\ntwo layers.\nshrinkage: Contraction caused by drying wood below the fibre saturation point; it is greater in\nthe wide face of flat-grain than in edge-grain lumber, and minimal in the longitudinal direction.\nslab: The exterior portion of a log removed in sawing lumber.\nsliced veneer: Veneer that is sliced off a log, bolt, or flitch with a knife.\nsoftwoods: Generally, one of the botanical groups of trees that in most cases have needlelike or\nscalelike leaves (the conifers); also the wood produced by such trees. The wood does not contain\npores. The term has no reference to the actual hardness of the wood.\nsplits: Separations along the grain extending through piece.

In practice, however, it often means roughly coincident with an annual layer.\nA tangential section is a longitudinal section through a tree or limb perpendicular to a radius. Flat\ngrain lumber is sawn tangentially.\ntension wood: Reaction wood formed on the upper side of branches and inclined stems of\nhardwood trees. Tension wood is characterized anatomically by lack of cell-wall lignification\nand often by the presence of gelatinous fibres. It has excessive longitudinal shrinkage, and sawn\nsurfaces usually have projecting fibres. Planed surfaces often are torn or have raised grain.\ntexture: Refers to the size of the cellular components of wood; may also describe their relative\nuniformity in size.\n\nthermo-mechanical pulp: Is a newsprint pulping process whereby wood chips are first\nsubjected to extremely high heat in a water medium; then refined through a disc-refiner to separate fibres from lignin. Basically, replaces the mechanical ground wood system.\ntrimmer: A battery of adjustable saws for trimming lumber to specific lengths or for removing\ndefects.\ntwin and quad bandsaws: A twin bandsaw is an adjustable, double bandsaw headrig making\ntwo cuts simultaneously. A quad bandsaw makes four cuts simultaneously.\nveneer: A thin layer or sheet of wood.\nvessels: Tube-like structures in porous woods (hardwoods only) made up of longitudinal series\nof relatively short, large-diameter cells having more or less open ends. Open vessels exposed on\nthe surfaces of a piece of wood are known as pores.\nwaferboard: A type of particleboard composed of wafers cut from roundwood bolts (mostly\npoplar) of uniform length and thickness resembling small pieces of veneer. The wafers re bonded\ntogether with resin binder, under heat and pressure, by a process similar to that by which\nparticleboard is made.\nwane: Bark or lack of wood from any cause on any edge or corner of a piece of lumber.\nwet-bulb temperature: The temperature when the thermometer bulb is kept moistened and\nhence cooled by evaporation. Because evaporation is greater in dry air, the thermometer will\nregister a lower temperature at lower relative humidity.\nwhite rot: A condition caused by fungi attacking the cellulose and lignin of wood\nsimultaneously, resulting in whitish residue that may be spongy or stringy. May occur as pocket\nrot.\n\nQUIZ ANSWERS\n\nLESSON ONE\n\nLESSON TWO\n\nLESSON THREE\n\nLESSON FOUR\n\nLESSON FIVE\n\n1. True\n2. False\n3. True\n4. False\n5. True\n6. True\n7. True\n8. False\n9.
