We used it as an example to argue that its inherently embedded spatial metaphor could compensate for the physical disconnectedness, and allow interaction on many different levels. Our paper proposes an interactive archiving and networking location where discourse is not only stored but categorised, analysed, retrieved and used to start new topics, or can be used to improve new debates. The focus is on the social values of PAP network and its empowering nature. The design and the structure is not simply a system for online socialisation rather it is a result of thoroughly studying available networks and their principles. It is a result of deep analysis of reality behind this community. We finally propose a set of principles that can secure a real innovative and creative knowledge exchange. \n\n\n\nseries\nASCAAD\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2008/01/21 21:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\nijac20075405\n\n\n\nid\nijac20075405\n\n\n\nauthors\nOxman, Neri\n\n\n\nyear\n2007\n\n\n\ntitle\nGet Real Towards Performance-Driven Computational Geometry\n\n\n\nsource\nInternational Journal of Architectural Computing vol. 5 - no. 4, pp. 663-684\n\n\n\nsummary\nIn historic design conventions geometry has traditionally promoted descriptive manifestations of form. Beyond the realm of geometry, the concept of performance which may inform such manifestations also carries important potential for design generation. This work explores the relation between geometry and performance from a computational-geometry perspective. It does so by revisiting certain analytical tools offered in most of today's 3-D modelers which support the evaluation of any generated surface geometry specifically curvature and draft angle analysis. It is demonstrated that these tools can be reconstructed with added functionality assigning 3-D geometrical features informed by structural and environmental performance respectively. In the examples illustrated surface thickness (as a function of structural performance) is assigned to curvature values, and transparency (as a function of light performance) is assigned to light analysis values. In a broader scope this work promotes a methodology of performance-informed form generation by means of computational geometry. Vector and tensor math was exploited to reconstruct existing analytical tools adapted to function as design generators.\n\n\n\nseries\njournal\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2008/02/25 19:30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\ncaadria2007_005\n\n\n\nid\ncaadria2007_005\n\n\n\nauthors\nOxman, Neri; Jesse L.

Scientists are tagging sea creatures, from salmon to whales, with tiny transmitters so that their movements can be tracked for over 20 years by receivers placed at one-kilometre intervals along the ocean floor. Pressure sensors added to these receivers allow real-time measurements of ocean depth, temperature and salinity, all of which provide significant information about climate change and the likelihood of natural disasters such as tsunamis. On shore, scientists around the world can receive this information regularly and upload it to a central database, resulting in current and reliable international records. \n\n\n\nseries\nACADIA\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2022/06/07 05:49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\nijac20075212\n\n\n\nid\nijac20075212\n\n\n\nauthors\nPapagiannakis, George; Magnenat-Thalmann, Nadia\n\n\n\nyear\n2007\n\n\n\ntitle\nMobile Augmented Heritage: Enabling Human Life in Ancient Pompeii\n\n\n\nsource\nInternational Journal of Architectural Computing vol. 5 - no. 2, pp. 396-415\n\n\n\nsummary\nWe propose a new methodology for real-time mobile mixed reality systems that feature realistic simulations of animated virtual human actors (clothes, body, skin, face) who augment real environments and re-enact staged storytelling dramas.

The remains of the past constitute culture and cultural heritage. Preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage appear to be, nowadays, a universal priority. Historic/architectural monuments are among the most significant categories of cultural heritage and their 3D digitization appears to be a chief way towards that direction. 3D digitization of architectural heritage is a very specific problem in the digitization domain. Since size, budget and applicability are some of the most important factors in choosing an appropriate digitization method, and since there is not an all-in-one solution in digitization, this problem cannot be always addressed by using one technique. In this paper we review methods that are available for 3D digitization of architectural heritage and we present two case studies of real-world digitization projects involving monuments and urban areas.\n\n\n\nseries\njournal\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2007/08/29 14:23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\nsigradi2007_af30\n\n\n\nid\nsigradi2007_af30\n\n\n\nauthors\nPayssé Alvarez, Marcelo; Silvana Demicheli Bonilla\n\n\n\nyear\n2007\n\n\n\ntitle\nARQ.NET.UY (ARChitecture by interNET from UruguaY) [ARQ.NET.UY (ARQuitectura por interNET desde UruguaY)]\n\n\n\nsource\nSIGraDi 2007 - [Proceedings of the 11th Iberoamerican Congress of Digital Graphics] México D.F. - México 23-25 October 2007, pp. 215-219\n\n\n\nsummary\nARQ.NET.UY is an academic initiative of the Technological Laboratory of Uruguay (LATU) and coordinated by the School of Architecture (UdelaR), which approaches the problematics of the formation, training, monitoring and evaluation in the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to achieve an effective insertion of the design in the \"global scenario\" that Internet offers us.\n\n\n\nseries\nSIGRADI\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2016/03/10 08:57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\ncf2007_417\n\n\n\nid\ncf2007_417\n\n\n\nauthors\nPeng, Wei; John S Gero\n\n\n\nyear\n2007\n\n\n\ntitle\nComputer-Aided Design Tools That Adapt\n\n\n\nsource\nComputer Aided Architectural Design Futures / 978-1-4020-6527-9 2007 [Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Computer Aided Architectural Design Futures / 978-1-4020-6527-9] Sydney (Australia) 1113 July 2007, pp. 417-430\n\n\n\nsummary\nThis paper describes an approach that enables a computer-aided design tool to learn conceptual knowledge as it is being used, and as a consequence adapts its behaviours to the changing environment.

The statistical sample included 49 fourth year architecture students, divided into three groups: the drawing group, the physical model group and the computer group. They were given a problem of designing a façade in an urban context in Glasgow over a two week period. The design process of each group was monitored over that period through observations, recordings and attitude measurement via a questionnaire survey. The results were analysed using the Statistical Programme for Social Sciences (SPSS). The dendrograms from cluster analysis revealed that there were well established perceptual dimensions, or clusters, for the façades design variables within the three groups because of using different media. The impact of media on design creativity, both as a process and a product, was investigated. All three media types yielded a positive correlation between media made design decisions more creative and media made design scheme more creative- with a correlation coefficient of 0.708 which was significant at the 0.01 level, p&lt;0.05.\n\n\n\nseries\nCAADRIA\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2022/06/07 05:50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\n4f70\n\n\n\nid\n4f70\n\n\n\nauthors\nPottmann; Helmut; Brell-Cokcan, Sigrid; Wallner, Johannes\n\n\n\nyear\n2007\n\n\n\ntitle\nDiscrete Surfacesfor Architectural Design\n\n\n\nsource\nNashboro Press 2007\n\n\n\nsummary\nGeometric problems originating in architecture can lead to interesting research and results in geometry processing, computer aided geometric design, and discrete differential geometry. In this ar- ticle we survey this development and consider an important problem of this kind: Discrete surfaces (meshes) which admit a multi-layered geometric support structure. It turns out that such meshes can be el- egantly studied via the concept of parallel mesh. Discrete versions of the network of principal curvature lines turn out to be parallel to ap- proximately spherical meshes. Both circular meshes and the conical meshes considered only recently are instances of this meta-theorem. We dicuss properties and interrelations of circular and conical meshes, and also their connections to meshes in static equilibrium and dis- crete minimal surfaces. We conclude with a list of research problems in geometry which are related to architectural design.\n\n\n\nseries\nbook\n\n\n\ntype\nnormal paper\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2008/03/14 14:59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\nascaad2007_036\n\n\n\nid\nascaad2007_036\n\n\n\nauthors\nPratini, E.F.\n\n\n\nyear\n2007\n\n\n\ntitle\nExperimental Tools for the Teaching of Technical Graphics and Improving Visualization\n\n\n\nsource\nEmbodying Virtual Architecture: The Third International Conference of the Arab Society for Computer Aided Architectural Design (ASCAAD 2007), 28-30 November 2007, Alexandria, Egypt, pp. 457-468\n\n\n\nsummary\nThis paper presents an updated evaluation of an experience of applying computer graphics, virtual reality and Internet resources in the teaching of technical graphics at the University of Brasilia, Brazil. It differs from a previous paper (Pratini, 2004) for the addition of an overview of the course, the context and the new teaching methodology. It is an extended, more detailed paper, which includes examples, and closes with some results of surveys on the didactic material and the methodology. Our motivation for this experiment is the fact that most of the students have a lack of previous knowledge on the basis of drawings, resulting difficulties in both understanding and visualizing technical drawings. In this experiment, we introduced VRML 3D modeling in addition to CAD and regular pencil-and-paper drawings study and practice. To support the learning of this broad knowledge not present in the technical graphics bibliography, we first provided a website with animations and virtual reality resources. Since 2003 we are providing a CD-ROM containing all the former website material which is updated each semester. At the present time, the CD-ROM contains almost all the needed didactic material and software for the one semester technical graphics course. This experience was intended to improve and to support learning in a way that motivates the students, young people who are used to play video and computer games. Classes, website and CD-ROM material were conceived to take advantage of computers ́ interactivity and animated resources. The use of computers ́ technology and new media to support the learning resulted a new methodology and several new unanswered questions. \n\n\n\nseries\nASCAAD\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2008/01/21 21:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\nijac20075106\n\n\n\nid\nijac20075106\n\n\n\nauthors\nPuusepp, Renee; Coates, Paul\n\n\n\nyear\n2007\n\n\n\ntitle\nSpatial Simulations with Cognitive and Design Agents\n\n\n\nsource\nInternational Journal of Architectural Computing vol. 5 - no. 1, pp. 100-114\n\n\n\nsummary\nAgent based design systems could provide useful decision help for architects working on spatial planning tasks that involve large number of actors or deal with complex urban situations. These systems are especially helpful in bridging the gap between concrete design proposals and high-level design abstractions such as frequency and flow diagrams. Every attempt to use computational design agents in the planning process will automatically raise many fundamental issues about spatial perception and representation of the environment. The paper discusses these issues in the light of some recent agent based simulations. Two case studies are presented in order to demonstrate different uses of computational agents in urban design. The first study shows how a simple agent-based design system placed in an urban context becomes a creative production tool. The second one reveals analytical capabilities of an agent system in urban environments.\n\n\n\nseries\njournal\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\n\n\nlast changed\n2007/06/14 10:11\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFor more results

We used it as an example to argue that its inherently embedded spatial metaphor could compensate for the physical disconnectedness, and allow interaction on many different levels. Our paper proposes an interactive archiving and networking location where discourse is not only stored but categorised, analysed, retrieved and used to start new topics, or can be used to improve new debates. The focus is on the social values of PAP network and its empowering nature. The design and the structure is not simply a system for online socialisation rather it is a result of thoroughly studying available networks and their principles. It is a result of deep analysis of reality behind this community. We finally propose a set of principles that can secure a real innovative and creative knowledge exchange. </td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\"><a href=\"https://papers.cumincad.org/cgi-bin/works/BrowseTree?field=series&amp;order=AZ\" target=\"_blank\">series</a></th>\n<td>ASCAAD</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">email</th>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">last changed</th>\n<td>2008/01/21 21:00</td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n<hr>\n<input name=\"idijac20075405\" type=\"CHECKBOX\">\n<table class=\"DATATABLE\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">_id</th>\n<td>ijac20075405</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">id</th>\n<td>ijac20075405</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">authors</th>\n<td>Oxman, Neri</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">year</th>\n<td>2007</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">title</th>\n<td>Get Real Towards Performance-Driven Computational Geometry</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">source</th>\n<td>International Journal of Architectural Computing vol. 5 - no. 4, pp. 663-684</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">summary</th>\n<td>In historic design conventions geometry has traditionally promoted descriptive manifestations of form. Beyond the realm of geometry, the concept of performance which may inform such manifestations also carries important potential for design generation. This work explores the relation between geometry and performance from a computational-geometry perspective. It does so by revisiting certain analytical tools offered in most of today's 3-D modelers which support the evaluation of any generated surface geometry specifically curvature and draft angle analysis. It is demonstrated that these tools can be reconstructed with added functionality assigning 3-D geometrical features informed by structural and environmental performance respectively. In the examples illustrated surface thickness (as a function of structural performance) is assigned to curvature values, and transparency (as a function of light performance) is assigned to light analysis values.

Historic/architectural monuments are among the most significant categories of cultural heritage and their 3D digitization appears to be a chief way towards that direction. 3D digitization of architectural heritage is a very specific problem in the digitization domain. Since size, budget and applicability are some of the most important factors in choosing an appropriate digitization method, and since there is not an all-in-one solution in digitization, this problem cannot be always addressed by using one technique.

There has been a change from the classical method of architectural composition, in which rather than linking diverse shapes together in a static layout, dynamic actions inspired by the landscape are linked instead.</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">keywords</th>\n<td>Landscape; design process; composition; morphology; topology</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\"><a href=\"https://papers.cumincad.org/cgi-bin/works/BrowseTree?field=series&amp;order=AZ\" target=\"_blank\">series</a></th>\n<td>SIGRADI</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">email</th>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">last changed</th>\n<td>2016/03/10 08:57</td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n<hr>\n<input name=\"idcf2007_197\" type=\"CHECKBOX\">\n<table class=\"DATATABLE\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">_id</th>\n<td>cf2007_197</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">id</th>\n<td>cf2007_197</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">authors</th>\n<td>Pickersgill, Sean</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">year</th>\n<td>2007</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">title</th>\n<td>Unreal Studio: Game Engine Software in the Architectural Design Studio</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">source</th>\n<td>Computer Aided Architectural Design Futures / 978-1-4020-6527-9 2007 [Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Computer Aided Architectural Design Futures / 978-1-4020-6527-9] Sydney (Australia) 1113 July 2007, pp. 197-210</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">summary</th>\n<td>This paper investigates the relationships between conventional modes of architectural design, those represented through and mediated by Cartesian schema, and the radical organization of spatial experience available through the use of NURBS modelling.

Within this software the first-person view attempts to provide a normalised experience of the VR environment (usually a game), yet there is significant scope for experiencing radically other spatial and topological presences.

They were given a problem of designing a façade in an urban context in Glasgow over a two week period. The design process of each group was monitored over that period through observations, recordings and attitude measurement via a questionnaire survey. The results were analysed using the Statistical Programme for Social Sciences (SPSS). The dendrograms from cluster analysis revealed that there were well established perceptual dimensions, or clusters, for the façades design variables within the three groups because of using different media. The impact of media on design creativity, both as a process and a product, was investigated. All three media types yielded a positive correlation between media made design decisions more creative and media made design scheme more creative- with a correlation coefficient of 0.708 which was significant at the 0.01 level, p&lt;0.05.</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\"><a href=\"https://papers.cumincad.org/cgi-bin/works/BrowseTree?field=series&amp;order=AZ\" target=\"_blank\">series</a></th>\n<td>CAADRIA</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">last changed</th>\n<td>2022/06/07 05:50</td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n<hr>\n<input name=\"id4f70\" type=\"CHECKBOX\">\n<table class=\"DATATABLE\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">_id</th>\n<td>4f70</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">id</th>\n<td>4f70</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">authors</th>\n<td>Pottmann; Helmut; Brell-Cokcan, Sigrid; Wallner, Johannes</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">year</th>\n<td>2007</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">title</th>\n<td>Discrete Surfacesfor Architectural Design</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">source</th>\n<td>Nashboro Press 2007</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">summary</th>\n<td>Geometric problems originating in architecture can lead to interesting research and results in geometry processing, computer aided geometric design, and discrete differential geometry. In this ar- ticle we survey this development and consider an important problem of this kind: Discrete surfaces (meshes) which admit a multi-layered geometric support structure. It turns out that such meshes can be el- egantly studied via the concept of parallel mesh. Discrete versions of the network of principal curvature lines turn out to be parallel to ap- proximately spherical meshes. Both circular meshes and the conical meshes considered only recently are instances of this meta-theorem. We dicuss properties and interrelations of circular and conical meshes, and also their connections to meshes in static equilibrium and dis- crete minimal surfaces. We conclude with a list of research problems in geometry which are related to architectural design.</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\"><a href=\"https://papers.cumincad.org/cgi-bin/works/BrowseTree?field=series&amp;order=AZ\" target=\"_blank\">series</a></th>\n<td>book</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\"><a href=\"https://papers.cumincad.org/cgi-bin/works/BrowseTree?field=type&amp;order=AZ\" target=\"_blank\">type</a></th>\n<td>normal paper</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">email</th>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">last changed</th>\n<td>2008/03/14 14:59</td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n<hr>\n<input name=\"idascaad2007_036\" type=\"CHECKBOX\">\n<table class=\"DATATABLE\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">_id</th>\n<td>ascaad2007_036</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">id</th>\n<td>ascaad2007_036</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">authors</th>\n<td>Pratini, E.F.</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">year</th>\n<td>2007</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">title</th>\n<td>Experimental Tools for the Teaching of Technical Graphics and Improving Visualization</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">source</th>\n<td>Embodying Virtual Architecture: The Third International Conference of the Arab Society for Computer Aided Architectural Design (ASCAAD 2007), 28-30 November 2007, Alexandria, Egypt, pp. 457-468</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">summary</th>\n<td>This paper presents an updated evaluation of an experience of applying computer graphics, virtual reality and Internet resources in the teaching of technical graphics at the University of Brasilia, Brazil. It differs from a previous paper (Pratini, 2004) for the addition of an overview of the course, the context and the new teaching methodology. It is an extended, more detailed paper, which includes examples, and closes with some results of surveys on the didactic material and the methodology. Our motivation for this experiment is the fact that most of the students have a lack of previous knowledge on the basis of drawings, resulting difficulties in both understanding and visualizing technical drawings. In this experiment, we introduced VRML 3D modeling in addition to CAD and regular pencil-and-paper drawings study and practice. To support the learning of this broad knowledge not present in the technical graphics bibliography, we first provided a website with animations and virtual reality resources. Since 2003 we are providing a CD-ROM containing all the former website material which is updated each semester. At the present time, the CD-ROM contains almost all the needed didactic material and software for the one semester technical graphics course. This experience was intended to improve and to support learning in a way that motivates the students, young people who are used to play video and computer games. Classes, website and CD-ROM material were conceived to take advantage of computers ́ interactivity and animated resources. The use of computers ́ technology and new media to support the learning resulted a new methodology and several new unanswered questions. </td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\"><a href=\"https://papers.cumincad.org/cgi-bin/works/BrowseTree?field=series&amp;order=AZ\" target=\"_blank\">series</a></th>\n<td>ASCAAD</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">email</th>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">last changed</th>\n<td>2008/01/21 21:00</td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n<hr>\n<input name=\"idijac20075106\" type=\"CHECKBOX\">\n<table class=\"DATATABLE\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">_id</th>\n<td>ijac20075106</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">id</th>\n<td>ijac20075106</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">authors</th>\n<td>Puusepp, Renee; Coates, Paul</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">year</th>\n<td>2007</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">title</th>\n<td>Spatial Simulations with Cognitive and Design Agents</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">source</th>\n<td>International Journal of Architectural Computing vol. 5 - no. 1, pp. 100-114</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">summary</th>\n<td>Agent based design systems could provide useful decision help for architects working on spatial planning tasks that involve large number of actors or deal with complex urban situations. These systems are especially helpful in bridging the gap between concrete design proposals and high-level design abstractions such as frequency and flow diagrams. Every attempt to use computational design agents in the planning process will automatically raise many fundamental issues about spatial perception and representation of the environment. The paper discusses these issues in the light of some recent agent based simulations. Two case studies are presented in order to demonstrate different uses of computational agents in urban design. The first study shows how a simple agent-based design system placed in an urban context becomes a creative production tool. The second one reveals analytical capabilities of an agent system in urban environments.</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\"><a href=\"https://papers.cumincad.org/cgi-bin/works/BrowseTree?field=series&amp;order=AZ\" target=\"_blank\">series</a></th>\n<td>journal</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">email</th>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr class=\"DATA\" valign=\"TOP\">\n<th align=\"RIGHT\">last changed</th>\n<td>2007/06/14 10:11</td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n<hr>\n</div>\n <input class=\"BUTTON\" type=\"SUBMIT\" value=\"Add checked items to favorite papers\">\n</form>\n<p>For more results click below:</p>\n</div>\n</body></html>"},"version":3}
