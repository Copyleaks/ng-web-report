There is increasing emphasis on materials efficiency—design that uses materials effectively and with as little damage to the environment as possible. All this takes place in a computer-based environment; teaching, too, draws increasingly on computerbased tools. This new edition has been comprehensively revised and reorganized to address these. The presentation has been enhanced and simplified; the figures, many of them new, have been redrawn in full color; worked intext examples illustrate methods and results in chapters that are not themselves collections of case studies; and additional features and supplements have been added. The key changes are outlined next.\n \n Key changes ■\n \n ■\n \n ■\n \n ■\n \n ■\n \n ■\n \n Chapter 1, Introduction, has been completely rewritten and illustrated to develop the history of materials and the evolution of materials in engineering. Engineering Design, introduced in Chapter 2, has been edited, with a full revision of all figures. Material Properties and Property Charts—a unique feature of the book, which appear in Chapters 3 and 4, have been redrawn in full color. Chapter 5 and 6—the central chapters that describe and illustrate selection methods—have been extensively revised with new explanations of the essential selection strategy. Chapters 7 and 8 (Multiple Constraints) have been revised, with in-text examples and more illuminating case studies. Chapters 9 and 10 (Materials and Shape) have been rewritten for greater clarity, with numerous in-text examples in Chapter 9.\n \n xiii\n \n xiv\n \n Features of the Fourth Edition\n \n ■\n \n ■\n \n ■\n \n ■\n \n ■ ■\n \n ■\n \n Chapters 11 and 12, Hybrid Materials, represent a further development of what was in the earlier edition, with a new development of the treatment of sandwich structures and with enhanced case studies. Chapters 13 and 14, Processing, contain sections and figures that emphasize the influence of processing on properties. Chapter 15, Materials and the Environment, is revised, with improved examples and links to the new information.1 Chapter 16, Industrial Design, is updated and linked to the second edition of the related text2 on this subject. Chapter 17, Forces for Change, has been updated. Appendices with Tables of Materials Properties, Useful Solutions, Indices, and Data Sources are updated, enlarged and reillustrated. The final appendix contains Exercises that are listed by chapter number.\n \n Material selection charts Full color versions of a number of the Material Selection Charts presented in this book are available. Samples can be found at www.grantadesign.com/ ashbycharts.htm.

Ashby, ButterworthHeinemann, ISBN 978-1-85617-608-8. 2 Materials and Design—The art and science of materials selection in Product Design, 2nd edition (2009), by M.F. Ashby and K. Johnson, Butterworth-Heinemann, ISBN 978-1-85617-497-8.\n \n Features of the Fourth Edition\n \n The CES EduPack The CES EduPack is a widely used software package that implements the methods developed here. The book does not rely on the software, but the learning experience is enhanced by using the two together to create an exciting teaching environment that stimulates exploration, self-teaching, and design innovation. For further information, see the last page of this book or visit http://www.grantadesign.com/education/.\n \n xv\n \n Preface\n \n Materials, of themselves, affect us little; it is the way we use them which influences our lives. Epictetus, AD 50–100, Discourses, Book 2, Chapter 5\n \n Materials influenced lives in Epictetus’ time and continue to do so today. In his day, the number of materials was small; today it is vast. The opportunities for innovation that materials offer now are equally immense. But advance is possible only if a procedure exists for making a rational choice from the materials on this great menu, and—if they are to be used—a way of identifying ways to shape, join, and finish them. This book develops a systematic procedure for selecting materials and processes, leading to the subset that best matches the requirements of a design. It is unique in the way that the information it contains has been structured. The structure gives rapid access to data and allows the user great freedom in exploring potential choices. The method is implemented in software* to provide greater flexibility. The approach here emphasizes design with materials rather than materials “science,” although the underlying science is used whenever possible to help with the structuring of selection criteria. The first six chapters require little prior knowledge: A first-year grasp of materials and mechanics is enough. The chapters dealing with shape and multiobjective selection are a little more advanced but can be omitted on a first reading. As far as possible, the book integrates materials selection with other aspects of design; the relationships with the stages of design and optimization and with the mechanics of material, are developed throughout. At the teaching level, the book is intended as a text for third- and fourth-year engineering courses on Materials for Design: A 6- to 10-lecture unit can be based on Chapters 1 through 6, 13, and 14; a full 20-lecture course, with project work using the associated software, will require use of the entire book. * The CES Edu materials and process selection platform is a product of Granta Design (www.grantadesign.com).\n \n xi\n \n xii\n \n Preface\n \n Beyond this, the book is intended as a reference of lasting value. The method, the charts, and the tables of performance indices have application in real problems of materials and process selection; and the table of data and the catalog of “useful solutions” (Appendices A and B) are particularly helpful in modeling—an essential ingredient in optimal design. The reader can use the content (and the software) at increasing levels of sophistication as his or her experience grows, starting with the material indices developed in the book’s case studies and graduating to the modeling of new design problems, leading to new material indices and penalty functions, as well as new—and perhaps novel—choices of material. This continuing education aspect is helped by the “Further readings” at the end of each chapter and Appendix E—a set of exercises covering all aspects of the text. Useful reference material is assembled in Appendices A, B, C, and D. As in any other book, the contents in this one are protected by copyright. Generally, it is an infringement to copy and distribute materials from a copyrighted source. However, the best way to use the charts that are a central feature of the book, for readers to have a clean copy on which they can draw, try out alternative selection criteria, write comments, and so forth; presenting the conclusion for a selected exercise is often most easily done in the same way. Although the book itself is copyrighted, instructors or readers are authorized to make unlimited copies of the charts and to reproduce these for teaching purposes, provided a full reference to their source is given.\n \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Many colleagues have been generous with discussion, criticism, and constructive suggestions.

Every manufactured thing, from the most lyrical of ladies’ hats to the greasiest of gearboxes, qualifies, in some sense or other, as a design. It can mean yet more. Nature, to some, is divine design; to others it is design by natural selection. The reader will agree that it is necessary to narrow the field, at least a little. This book is about mechanical design and the role of materials in it. Mechanical components have mass; they carry loads; they conduct heat and electricity; they are exposed to wear and to corrosive environments; they are made of one or more materials; they have shape; and they must be manufactured. The book describes how these activities are related. Materials have had limited design since man first made clothes, built shelters, and waged wars. They still do. But materials and processes to shape them are developing faster now than at any time in history; the challenges and opportunities they present are greater than ever before. This book develops a strategy for confronting such challenges and seizing those opportunities.\n \n 1.2 MATERIALS IN DESIGN Design is the process of translating a new idea or a market need into the detailed information from which a product can be manufactured. Each of its stages requires decisions about the materials of which the product is to be made and the process for making it. Normally, the choice of material is dictated by the design. But sometimes it is the other way around: The new product, or the evolution of the existing one, was suggested or made possible by a new material.\n \n 1.2 Materials in Design\n \n The number of materials available to engineers is vast: 160,000 or more. Although standardization strives to reduce the number, the continuing appearance of new materials with novel and exploitable properties expands the options further. How, then, do engineers choose, from this vast menu, the material best suited to their purpose? Do they rely on their experience? In the past that was how it was done, passing on this precious commodity to apprentices who, much later in their lives, might themselves assume the role of in-house materials guru. There is no question of the value of experience. But many things have changed in the world of engineering, and all of them work against the success of this model. There is the drawn-out time scale of apprentice-based learning. There is job mobility, meaning that the guru who is here today is usually gone tomorrow. And there is the rapid evolution of materials information, as already mentioned. A strategy that relies on experience is not in tune with today’s computer-based environment. We need a systematic procedure— one with steps that can be taught quickly, that is robust in the decisions it reaches, that allows computer implementation, and that is compatible with the other established tools of engineering design. The choice of material cannot be made independently of the choice of process by which the material is to be shaped, joined, and finished. Cost enters the equation, both in the choice of material and in the way the material is processed. So, too, does the influence of material usage on the environment in which we live. And it must be recognized that good engineering design alone is not enough to sell products. In almost everything from home appliances to automobiles and aircraft, the form, texture, feel, color, beauty, and meaning of the product—the satisfaction it gives the person who owns or uses it—are important. This aspect, known confusingly as industrial design, is one that, if neglected, can lose markets. Good design works; excellent design also gives pleasure. Design problems are almost always open-ended. They do not have a unique or “correct” solution, though some solutions will clearly be better than others. They differ from the analytical problems used in teaching mechanics, or structures, or thermodynamics, which generally do have single, correct answers. So the first tool a designer needs is an open mind: a willingness to consider all possibilities. But a net cast widely draws in many different fish. A procedure is necessary for selecting the excellent from the merely good. This book deals with the materials aspects of the design process. It develops a methodology that, properly applied, gives guidance through the forest of complex choices the designer faces. The ideas of material and process attributes are introduced. They are mapped on material and process selection charts that show the lay of the land, so to speak, and that simplify the initial\n \n 3\n \n 4\n \n CHAPTER 1:\n \n Introduction\n \n survey for potential candidate materials. Real life always involves conflicting objectives—minimizing mass while at the same time minimizing cost is an example—requiring the use of trade-off methods. The interaction between material and shape can be built into the method. Taken together, these suggest schemes for expanding the boundaries of material performance by creating hybrids—combinations of two or more materials, shapes, and configurations with unique property profiles. None of this can be implemented without data for material properties and process attributes: Ways to find them are described. The role of aesthetics in engineering design is discussed. The forces driving change in the materials world are surveyed, the most obvious of which is the force dealing with environmental concerns. The Appendices contain additional useful information. The methods lend themselves readily to implementation as computer-based tools; one, the CES Edu materials selection platform,1 is used for many of the case studies and figures in this book. They offer, too, potential for interfacing with tools for computer-aided design, finite element analysis, optimization routines, and product data management software. All this is found in the following chapters, with case studies illustrating applications. But first, a little history.\n \n 1.3 THE EVOLUTION OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS Throughout history, materials have had limited design. The ages of man are named for the materials he used: stone, bronze, iron. And when a man died, the materials he treasured were buried with him: Tutankhamun in his enameled sarcophagus, Agamemnon with his bronze sword and mask of gold, Viking chieftains in their burial ships—each treasure representing the high technology of their day. If these men had lived and died today, what would they have taken with them? Their titanium watch, perhaps; their carbon-fiber–reinforced tennis racquet; their metal-matrix composite mountain bike; their shape-memory alloy eyeglass frame with lenses coated with diamond-like carbon; their polyether-ethyl-ketone crash helmet; their carbon nanotube reinforced iPod? This is not the age of one material; it is the age of an immense range of materials. There has never been an era in which their evolution was faster and the range of their properties more varied. The menu of materials has expanded so rapidly that designers who left college 20 years ago can be forgiven for not knowing that many of them exist. But not to know is, for the 1\n \n Granta Design Ltd., Cambridge, U.K.—www.grantadesign.com.\n \n 1.3 The Evolution of Engineering Materials\n \n designer, risking disaster. Innovative design often means the imaginative exploitation of the properties offered by new or improved materials. And for the man on the street, the schoolboy even, not to know is to miss one of the great developments of our age: the age of advanced materials. This evolution and its increasing pace are illustrated on the cover page and, in more detail, in Figure 1.1. The materials of prehistory (before 10,000 BC, the Stone Age) were ceramics and glasses, natural polymers, and composites. Weapons—always the peak of technology—were made of wood and flint; buildings and bridges of stone and wood. Naturally occurring gold and silver were available locally and, through their rarity, assumed great influence as currency, but their role in technology was small. The development of rudimentary thermo-chemistry allowed the extraction of, first, copper and bronze, then iron (the Bronze Age, 4000–1000 BC and the Iron Age, 1000 BC–1620 AD), stimulating enormous advances in technology.2 Cast iron technology (1620s) established the dominance of metals in engineering; since then the evolution of steels (1850 onward), light alloys (1940s), and special alloys has consolidated their position. By the 1950s, “engineering materials” meant “metals.” Engineers were given courses in metallurgy; other materials were barely mentioned. There had, of course, been developments in the other classes of material. Improved cements, refractories, and glasses; and rubber, Bakelite, and polyethylene among polymers; but their share of the total materials market was small. Since 1950 all that has changed. The rate of development of new metallic alloys is now slow; demand for steel and cast iron has in some countries actually fallen.3 The polymer and composite industries, on the other hand, are growing rapidly, and projections of the growth of production of new high-performance ceramics suggests continued expansion here also. The material developments documented in the timeline of Figure 1.1 were driven by the desire for ever greater performance. One way of displaying this progression is by following the way in which properties have evolved on material-property charts. Figure 1.2 shows one of them—a strength-density chart. The oval bubbles plot the range of strength and density of materials; the larger colored envelopes enclose families. The chart is plotted for six successive points in historical time, ending with the present day. The materials of pre-history, shown in (a), cover only a tiny fraction of this strength-density 2 There is a cartoon on my office door, put there by a student, showing an aggrieved Celt confronting a swordsmith with the words, “You sold me this bronze sword last week and now I’m supposed to upgrade to iron!” 3 Do not, however, imagine that the days of steel are over. Steel production accounts for 90% of all world metal output, and its unique combination of strength, ductility, toughness, and low price makes it irreplaceable.\n \n 5\n \n 6\n \n CHAPTER 1:\n \n Introduction\n \n FIGURE 1.1 A materials timeline.

By the time of the peak of the Roman Empire, around 50 BC (b), the area occupied by metals had expanded considerably, giving Rome critical advantages in weaponry and defense. The progress thereafter was slow: 1500 years later (c) not much has changed, although, significantly, cast iron started to appear. Even 500 years after that (d), expansion of the occupied area of the chart is small; aluminum only just starts to creep in. Then things accelerate. By 1945 the metals envelope has expanded considerably and a new envelope—that of synthetic polymers—occupies a significant position. Between then and the present day the expansion has been dramatic. The filled area now starts to approach some fundamental limits (not shown here) beyond which it is difficult to go. Any slice through material property space (we will encounter many) shows development like this. How can we expand the filled area further? And what would we gain if we did so? These are fascinating questions that will be answered in Chapters 13 and 14. We end this chapter, instead, with a look at the way material developments have been absorbed into products.\n \n 1.4 THE EVOLUTION OF MATERIALS IN PRODUCTS In this section we consider four examples of the changes in the way materials are used, each spanning about 100 years—not much more than a single life time. Bear in mind that in preceding generations, change was far slower. The horse-drawn carriage has a history of 2000 years; the automobile only a little more than 100. The kettle is the oldest of household appliances and the one found in more homes than any other; there is evidence (not entirely convincing) of a 4000-year-old kettle. Early kettles, heated directly over a fire, were of\n \n FIGURE 1.3 Kettles: cast iron, bronze, polypropylene.\n \n 1.4 The Evolution of Materials in Products\n \n necessity made of materials that could conduct heat well and withstand exposure to an open flame: iron, copper, or bronze (Figure 1.3). Electric kettles, developed in the 1890s, had external heating elements to replace the flame, but were otherwise much like their predecessors. All that changed with the introduction, by the Swan company (1922), of a heating element sealed in a metal tube placed within the water chamber. The kettle body no longer had to conduct heat—indeed for safety and ease of use it was much better made of a thermal and electrical insulator. Today almost all kettles are made of plastic, allowing economic manufacture with great freedom of form and color. “Sweeping and dusting are homicidal practices: they consist of taking dust from the floor, mixing it in the atmosphere, and causing it to be inhaled by the inhabitants of the house. In reality it would be preferable to leave the dust alone where it was.”\n \n That was a doctor, writing about 100 years ago. More than any previous generation, the Victorians and their contemporaries in other countries worried about dust. They were convinced that it carried disease and that dusting merely dispersed it, when, as the doctor said, it became yet more infectious. Their response was to invent the vacuum cleaner (Figure 1.4). The vacuum cleaners of that time were human-powered. The materials were, by today’s standards, primitive. The cleaner was made almost entirely from natural materials: wood, canvas, leather, and rubber. The only metal parts\n \n FIGURE 1.4 Vacuum cleaners: a hand-powered cleaner from 1880, the Electrolux cylinder cleaner of 1960, and the Dyson centrifugal cleaner of 2010.

It reflects the use of materials in that era. Even a car, in 1900, was mostly made of wood, leather, and rubber; only the engine and drive train had to be metal. The electric vacuum cleaner first appeared around 1908.4 By 1950 the design had evolved into the cylinder cleaner. Air flow was axial, drawn through the filter by an electric fan. One advance in design was, of course, the electrically driven air pump. But there were others: This cleaner is almost entirely made of metal—the case, the end-caps, the runners, and even the tube to suck up the dust are mild steel. Metals entirely replaced natural materials. Developments since then have been rapid, driven by the innovative use of new materials. Power and air flow rate are much increased, and dust separation is centrifugal rather than by filtration. This is made possible by higher power density in the motor reflecting improved magnetic materials. The casing is entirely polymeric, and makes extensive use of snap fasteners for rapid assembly. No metal is visible anywhere; even the straight part of the suction tube, which was metal in all earlier models, is now polypropylene. The optics of a camera are much older than the camera itself (Figure 1.5). Lenses capable of resolving the heavens (Galileo, 1600) or the microscopic (Hooke, 1665) predate the camera by centuries. The key ingredient, of course, was the ability to record the image (Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, 1814). Early cameras were made of wood and constructed with the care and finish of a cabinetmaker. They had well-ground glass lenses and, later, a metal aperture and shutter manufactured by techniques already well developed for watch- and clockmaking.\n \n 4 Inventors: Murray Spengler and William B. Hoover. The second name has become part of the English language, along with the names of such luminaries as John B. Stetson (the hat), S.F.B. Morse (the code), Leo Henrik Baikeland (Bakelite), and Thomas Crapper (the flush toilet).\n \n 1.4 The Evolution of Materials in Products\n \n FIGURE 1.6 Aircraft: the Wright biplane of 1903, the Douglas DC3 of 1935, and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner of 2010.\n \n For the next 90 years photography was practiced by a specialized few. Invention of celluloid-backed film and the cheap box camera around 1900 moved it from a specialized to a mass market, with competition between camera makers to capture a share. Wood, canvas, and leather (with brass and steel only where essential) were quickly replaced by precision-engineered steel bodies and control mechanisms; then from the 1960s on, by aluminum, magnesium, or titanium for low weight, durability, and prestige. Digital technology fractionated the market further. High-end cameras now have optical systems with compound lenses combining glasses with tailored refractive indices, manufactured with the precision and electronic sophistication of scientific instruments. At the other end of the range, point-and-shoot cameras with molded polypropylene or ABS bodies, and acrylic or polycarbonate lenses fill a need. Perhaps the most dramatic example of the way material usage has changed is found in airframes. Early planes were made of low-density woods (spruce, balsa, and ply), steel wire,5 and silk. Wood remained the principal structural material of airframes well into the twentieth century, but as planes got larger it became less and less practical. The aluminum airframe, exemplified by the Douglas DC3, was the answer. It provided the high bending stiffness and strength at low weight necessary for scale-up and extended range. Aluminum remained the dominant structural material of civil airliners for the remainder of the twentieth century. By the end of the century, the pressure for greater fuel economy and lower carbon emissions had reached a level that made composites an increasingly attractive choice, despite their higher cost and greater technical challenge. The future of airframes is exemplified by Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner (80% carbon-fiber–reinforced plastic by volume), claimed to be 30% lighter per seat than competing aircraft. (See Figure 1.6.) All this has happened within one lifetime. Competitive design requires the innovative use of new materials and the clever exploitation of their special properties, both engineering and aesthetic. Many manufacturers of kettles, cleaners, and cameras failed to innovate and exploit; now they are extinct. That somber thought prepares us for the chapters that follow, in which we consider what they forgot: the optimum use of materials in design. 5\n \n “Piano wire”—drawn high-carbon-steel wire—was developed for harpsichords around 1350.\n \n 11\n \n 12\n \n CHAPTER 1:\n \n Introduction\n \n 1.5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS What do we learn? There is an acceleration in material development and of the ways in which materials are used in products. One of the drivers for change, certainly, is performance: The displacement of bronze by iron in weapons of the Iron Age, and that of wood by aluminum in airframes of the twentieth century, had their origins in the superior performance of the new materials. But performance is not the only factor. Economics exerts powerful pressures for change: the use of polymers in the jug kettle, the vacuum cleaner, and the cheap camera derives in part from the ease with which polymers can be molded to complex shapes. Technical change in other fields—digital imaging technology, for example—can force change in the way materials are chosen. And there are many more drivers for change that we will encounter in later chapters, among them a concern for the environment, restrictive legislation and directives, aesthetics, and taste. Engineering materials are evolving faster, and the choice is wider, than ever before. Examples of products in which a new material has captured a market are as common as, well, plastic bottles. Or aluminum cans. Or polycarbonate eyeglass lenses. Or carbon-fiber golf club shafts. It is important in the early stage of design, or of redesign, to examine the full materials menu, not rejecting options merely because they are unfamiliar. That is what this book is about.\n \n 1.6 FURTHER READING The history and evolution of materials Singer, C. et al. (1954–2001). A history of technology (21 volumes).

This does not mean that we ignore industrial design—pattern, color, texture, and (above all) consumer appeal—but that comes later. The optimum starting point in product development is good mechanical design, and the ways in which the selection of materials and processes contribute to it. Our aim is to develop a methodology for selecting materials and processes that is design-led; that is, it uses, as inputs, the functional requirements of the design. To do so we must first look briefly at the design process itself. Like most technical fields, mechanical design is encrusted with its own special jargon, some of it bordering on the incomprehensible. We need very little, but it cannot all be avoided. This chapter introduces some of the words and phrases—the vocabulary—of design, the stages in its implementation, and the ways in which materials selection links with these.\n \n 2.2 THE DESIGN PROCESS The starting point of a design is a market need or a new idea; the end point is the full specification of a product that fills the need or embodies the idea. A need must be identified before it can be met. It is essential to define the need precisely—that is, to formulate a need statement, often in this form: “A device is required to perform task X,” expressed as a set of design requirements. Writers on design emphasize that the need statement should be solution-neutral (that is, it should not imply how the task will be performed) to avoid narrow thinking constrained by preconceptions. Between the need statement and the product specification lie the stages shown in Figure 2.1: concept, embodiment, and detailed design, explained in a moment. The product itself is called a technical system. A technical system consists of subassemblies and components, put together in a way that performs the required task, as in the breakdown of Figure 2.2. It is like describing a cat (the system) as made up of one head, one body, one tail, four legs, and so on (the subassemblies), each composed of components: femurs, quadriceps, claws, fur. This decomposition is a useful way to analyze an existing design, but it is not of much help in the design process itself, that is, in devising new designs. Better, for this purpose, is one based on the ideas of systems analysis, which considers the inputs, flows, and outputs of information, energy, and materials, as in Figure 2.3. This design converts the inputs into the outputs. An electric motor, for example, converts electrical into mechanical energy; a forging press takes\n \n 2.2 The Design Process\n \n FIGURE 2.1 The design flow chart. The design proceeds from the identification of a market need, clarified as a set of design requirements, through concept, embodiment, and detailed analysis to a product specification.\n \n Market need: Design requirements\n \n Determine function structure Seek working principles Evaluate and select concepts\n \n Concept\n \n Develop layout, scale, form Model and analyze assemblies Evaluate and select layouts\n \n Embodiment\n \n Analyse components in detail Optimize performance and cost Final choice of material and process\n \n Detail\n \n Product specification\n \n Iterate\n \n Component 1.1\n \n Subassembly 1\n \n Component 1.2 Component 1.3\n \n Component 2.1\n \n Technical system\n \n Subassembly 2\n \n Component 2.2 Component 2.3\n \n Component 3.1 Subassembly 3\n \n Component 3.2 Component 3.3\n \n FIGURE 2.2 The analysis of a technical system as a breakdown into assemblies and components.

This approach, when elaborated, helps structure thinking about alternative designs.\n \n and reshapes material; a burglar alarm collects information and converts it to noise. In this approach, the system is broken down into connected subsystems, each of which performs a specific function, as shown in Figure 2.3. The resulting arrangement is called the function structure or function decomposition of the system. It is like describing a cat as an appropriate linkage of a respiratory system, a cardio-vascular system, a nervous system, a digestive system, and so on. Alternative designs link the unit functions in alternative ways, combine functions, or split them. The function structure gives a systematic way of assessing design options. The design proceeds by developing concepts to perform the functions in the function structure, each based on a working principle. At this, the conceptual design stage, all options are open: The designer considers alternative concepts and the ways in which these might be separated or combined. The next stage, embodiment, takes the promising concepts and seeks to analyze their operation at an approximate level. This involves sizing the components and selecting materials that will perform properly in the ranges of stress, temperature, and environment suggested by the design requirements, examining the implications for performance and cost. The embodiment stage ends with a feasible layout, which is then passed to the detailed design stage. Here specifications for each component are drawn up. Critical components may be subjected to precise mechanical or thermal analysis. Optimization methods are applied to components and groups of components to maximize performance. A final choice of geometry and material is made and the methods of production are analyzed and costed. The stage ends with a detailed production specification.\n \n 2.2 The Design Process\n \n All that sounds well and good. If only it were so simple. The linear process suggested by Figure 2.1 obscures the strong coupling between the three stages. The consequences of choices made at the concept or the embodiment stages may not become apparent until the detail is examined. Iteration, looping back to explore alternatives, is an essential part of the design process. Think of each of the many possible choices that could be made as an array of blobs in design space, as shown in Figure 2.4. Here C1, C2... are possible concepts, and E1, E2... and D1, D2... are possible embodiments and detailed elaborations of them. The design process becomes one of creating paths and linking compatible blobs until a connection is made from the top (market need) to the bottom (product specification). Some trial paths have dead ends, some loop back. It is like finding a track across difficult terrain—it may be necessary to go back many times to go forward in the end. Once a path is found, it is always possible to make it look linear and logical (and many books do this), but the reality is more like Figure 2.4 than Figure 2.1.\n \n Market need: Design requirements\n \n C6 C2\n \n C5\n \n C3\n \n C4\n \n C1\n \n C7\n \n Concept E4\n \n E3\n \n E5 E6\n \n E1 E2\n \n D5\n \n D3 D1\n \n Detail D2\n \n E8\n \n Embodiment E7\n \n D4 D6\n \n Product specification\n \n FIGURE 2.4 The convoluted path of design. Here the C-blobs represent concepts; the E-blobs, embodiments of the Cs; and the D-blobs, detailed realizations of the Es. The process is complete when a compatible path from “need” to “specification” can be identified. It is a devious path (the full red line) with back loops and dead ends (the broken lines). This creates the need for tools that allow fluid access to materials information at differing levels of breadth and detail.\n \n 19\n \n 20\n \n CHAPTER 2:\n \n The Design Process\n \n Thus a key part of design, and of selecting materials for it, is flexibility, the ability to explore alternatives quickly, keeping the big picture as well as the details in mind. Our focus in later chapters is on the selection of materials and processes, where exactly the same need arises. This requires some kind of mapping of the “universes” of materials and processes to allow quick surveys of alternatives while still providing detail when it is needed. The selection charts of Chapter 4 and the methods of Chapter 5 help do this. Described in the abstract, these ideas are not easy to grasp. An example will help—it comes in Section 2.6. First, a look at types of design.\n \n 2.3 TYPES OF DESIGN It is not always necessary to start, as it were, from scratch. Original design does: it involves a new idea or working principle (the ballpoint pen, the compact disc). New materials can offer new, unique combinations of properties that enable original design. Thus high-purity silicon enabled the transistor; high-purity glass, the optical fiber; high coercive-force magnets, the miniature earphone; solid-state lasers the compact disc. Sometimes the new material suggests the new product. Sometimes, instead, the new product demands the development of a new material: Nuclear technology drove the development of a series of new zirconium alloys and low-carbon stainless steels; space technology stimulated the development of light weight composites; gas turbine technology today drives development of high-temperature alloys and ceramic coatings. Original design sounds exciting, and it is. But most design is not like that. Almost all design is adaptive or developmental. The starting point is an existing product or product range. The motive for redesigning it may be to enhance performance, to reduce cost, or to adapt it to changing market conditions. Adaptive design takes an existing concept and seeks an incremental advance in performance through a refinement of the working principle. It, too, is often made possible by developments in materials: polymers replacing metals in household appliances; carbon fiber replacing wood in sports equipment. The appliance and the sports equipment markets are fast-moving and competitive. These markets have frequently been won (and lost) by the way in which the manufacturer has adapted the product by exploiting new materials. Finally, variant design involves a change of scale or dimension or detailing without a change of function or the method of achieving it: the scaling up of boilers, or of pressure vessels, or of turbines, for instance. Change of scale or circumstances of use may require change of material: Small boats are made of fiberglass, large ships are made of steel; small boilers are made of\n \n 2.4 Design Tools and Materials Data\n \n copper, large ones of steel; subsonic planes are made of one alloy, supersonic of another—all for good reasons, as detailed in later chapters.\n \n 2.4 DESIGN TOOLS AND MATERIALS DATA To implement the steps of Figure 2.1, use is made of design tools. They are shown as inputs, attached to the left of the main backbone of the design methodology in Figure 2.5. The tools enable the modeling and optimization of a design, easing the routine aspects of each phase. Function modelers suggest viable function structures. Configuration optimizers suggest or refine shapes. Geometric and 3D solid modeling packages allow visualization and create files that can be downloaded to numerically controlled prototyping and manufacturing systems. Optimization, DFM, DFA,1 and cost estimation software allows manufacturing aspects to be refined. Finite element (FE) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) packages allow precise mechanical and thermal analysis even when the geometry is complex, deformations are\n \n Market need: Design requirements Material data needs\n \n Design tools Function modeling Viability studies\n \n Concept\n \n Data for ALL materials, low precision and detail\n \n Embodiment\n \n Data for a SUBSET of materials, higher precision and detail\n \n Detail\n \n Data for ONE material, highest precision and detail\n \n Approximate analysis Geometric modeling Simulations methods Materials selector Cost modeling Component modeling Finite-element modeling (FEM) DFM, DFA\n \n Product specification\n \n FIGURE 2.5 The design flow chart, showing how design tools and materials selection enter the procedure. Information about materials is needed at each stage, but at very different levels of breadth and precision. Iteration is part of the process. 1\n \n Design for Manufacture and Design for Assembly.\n \n 21\n \n 22\n \n CHAPTER 2:\n \n The Design Process\n \n large, and temperatures fluctuate. There is a natural progression in the use of the tools as the design evolves: approximate analysis and modeling at the conceptual stage; more sophisticated modeling and optimization at the embodiment stage; and precise (“exact”—but nothing is ever that) analysis at the detailed design stage. Tools for material selection play a major part in each stage of the design. The nature of the data needed in the early stages differs greatly in its level of precision and breadth from that needed later on (Figure 2.5, right). At the concept stage, the designer requires approximate property values, but for the widest possible range of materials. All options are open: A polymer may be the best choice for one concept, a metal for another, even though the function is the same. The problem, at this stage, is not precision and detail; it is breadth and speed of access: How can the vast range of data be presented to give the designer the greatest freedom in considering alternatives? At the embodiment stage the landscape has narrowed. Here we need data for a subset of materials, but at a higher level of precision and detail. These are found in more specialized handbooks and software that deal with a single class or subclass of materials—metals or just aluminum alloys, for instance. The risk now is that of losing sight of the bigger spread of materials to which we must return if the details don’t work out; it is easy to get trapped in a single line of thinking—a single set of “connections” in the sense of Figure 2.4—when other connections may offer a better solution. The final stage, that of detailed design, requires a still higher level of precision and detail, but for only one or a very few materials. Such information is best found in the datasheets issued by the material producers themselves and in detailed databases for restricted material classes. A given material (polyethylene, for instance) has a range of properties that derive from differences in the ways different producers make it. At the detailed design stage, a supplier must be identified, and the properties of their product used in the design calculations; a product from another supplier may differ. And sometimes even this is not good enough. If the component is a critical one (meaning that its failure could, in some sense or another, be disastrous), then it is prudent to conduct in-house tests to measure the critical properties, using a sample of the material that will be used to make the product itself. The materials input does not end with the establishment of production. Products fail in service, and failures contain information. It is an imprudent manufacturer who does not collect and analyze data on failures. Often this points to the misuse of a material, one that redesign or reselection can eliminate. So material choice depends on function. But that is not the only constraint.\n \n 2.6 Case Study: Devices to Open Corked Bottles\n \n Function\n \n Shape\n \n Material\n \n Process\n \n FIGURE 2.6 The central problem of materials selection in mechanical design: the interaction between function, material, process, and shape.\n \n 2.5 FUNCTION, MATERIAL, SHAPE, AND PROCESS The selection of material is tied in with process and shape. To make a shape, the material is subjected to processes that, collectively, are called manufacture: these include primary forming processes (e.g., casting and forging), material removal processes (machining, drilling), joining processes (e.g., welding) and finishing processes (e.g., painting or electroplating). Function, material, shape, and process interact (Figure 2.6). Function, as already described, influences material choice. Material choice influences processes through the material’s ability to be cast or molded or welded or heat-treated. Process determines shape; size; precision; and, of course, cost. These interactions are two-way: specification of shape restricts the choice of material and process; but equally the specification of process limits the material choice and the accessible shapes. The more sophisticated the design, the tighter the specifications and the greater the interactions. The interaction between function, material, shape, and process lies at the heart of the material selection process. It is a theme we will return to throughout this book, visiting each of the hexagons of Figure 2.6 in turn. But first we look at a case study to illustrate the design process.\n \n 2.6 CASE STUDY: DEVICES TO OPEN CORKED BOTTLES Wine, like cheese, is one of man’s improvements on nature. And as long as humans have cared about wine, people have cared about corks to keep it safely sealed in flasks and bottles. “Corticum... demovebit amphorae...,”\n \n 23\n \n 24\n \n CHAPTER 2:\n \n The Design Process\n \n (a)\n \n (b)\n \n (c)\n \n ?\n \n (d)\n \n (e)\n \n FIGURE 2.7 Left: the market need; a device is sought to allow access to wine contained in a corked bottle. Right: five possible concepts, illustrating physical principles, to fill the need.\n \n (“Uncork the amphora...)” sang Horace2 to celebrate the anniversary of his miraculous escape from death by a falling tree. But how did he do it? A corked bottle creates a market need: the need to gain access to the wine inside. We might state it thus: “A device is required to pull corks from wine bottles.” But hold on. The need must be expressed in solution-neutral form, and this is not. The aim is to gain access to the wine; our statement implies that this will be done by removing the cork, and that the cork will be removed by pulling. There could be other ways. So we will try again: “A device is required to allow access to wine in a corked bottle” (Figure 2.7), and one might add, “with convenience, at modest cost, and without contaminating the wine.” Five concepts for doing this are shown on the right of Figure 2.7. In order, the devices act to remove the cork by axial traction (pulling); to remove it by shear tractions; to push it out from below; to pulverize it; and to bypass it altogether by knocking the neck off the bottle.3 Numerous devices exist that use the first three of these concepts. The others are used too, though generally only in moments of desperation. We shall eliminate these on the grounds that they might contaminate the wine, and examine the others more closely, exploring working principles. Figure 2.8 shows one example for each of the first three concepts: In the first, a screw\n \n 2\n \n Horace, Q. 27 BC, Odes, Book III, Ode 8, line 10.

The thermal shock removed the neck cleanly and neatly. 3\n \n 2.6 Case Study: Devices to Open Corked Bottles\n \n (a)\n \n (b)\n \n (c)\n \n FIGURE 2.8 Working principles for implementing the first three concepts of Figure 2.7.

Examples of all three appear in the cover picture of this chapter. Figure 2.9 shows embodiment sketches for devices based on just one concept—that of axial traction. The first is a direct pull; the other three use some sort of mechanical advantage—levered pull, geared pull, and spring-assisted pull.

They lead directly to the property limits and material indices, as described in Chapter 5, in which we examine procedures with requirements such as “light, strong beam” or “slender, elastic, blade” and use them to identify a subset of materials that perform this function particularly well. The final choice of material and process forms part of the detailed stage of design (Figure 2.9), leading to full specifications to enable manufacture. We conclude by returning to the idea of function structure. That for the cork remover is sketched in the upper part of Figure 2.10: Generate a force, transmit a force, apply the force to the cork. The alternative designs differ in the working principle by which these functions are achieved, as indicated in the lower part of the figure. Others could be devised by making other links.\n \n 2.7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Design is an iterative process. The starting point is a market need captured in a set of design requirements. Concepts for a product that meet the need are devised. If initial estimates and exploration of alternatives suggest that the concept is\n \n 2.8 Further Reading\n \n viable, the design proceeds to the embodiment stage: Working principles are selected, size and layout are decided, and initial estimates of performance and cost are made. If the outcome is successful, the designer proceeds to the detailed design stage: optimization of performance, full analysis of critical components, preparation of detailed production drawings (usually as CAD files), specifications of tolerance, precision, assembly, and finishing methods. Materials selection enters at each stage, but at different levels of breadth and precision. At the conceptual stage all materials and processes are potential candidates, requiring a procedure that allows rapid access to data for a wide range of each, although without the need for great precision. The preliminary selection passes to the embodiment stage, the calculations and optimizations of which require information at a higher level of precision and detail. They eliminate all but a small shortlist of candidate materials and processes for the final, detailed stage of the design. For these few candidates, highest-quality data are required. Data exist that meet the needs of all these levels. Each level requires its own data management scheme, described in the following chapters. The management system must be design-led, yet must recognize the richness of choice and embrace the complex interaction between the material, its shape, the process by which it is given that shape, and the function it is required to perform. And it must allow rapid iteration—back-looping when a particular path proves to be unprofitable. Tools now exist to help with all of this. We will meet one— the CES materials and process selection platform—later in this book. But given this complexity, why not opt for the safe bet: Stick to what you used before? Many have chosen that option. Few are still in business.\n \n 2.8 FURTHER READING A chasm exists between books on design methodology and those on materials selection: each largely ignores the other. The book by French is remarkable for its insights, but the word “material” does not appear in its index. Pahl and Beitz have near-biblical standing in the design camp, but their text is heavy going. Ullman and Cross take a more relaxed approach and are easier to digest. The books by Budinski and Budinski, by Charles, Crane, and Furness, and by Farag present the materials case well, but are less good on design. Lewis illustrates material selection through case studies, but does not develop a systematic procedure. The best compromise, perhaps, is Dieter.\n \n General texts on design methodology Cross, N.

This chapter presents the menu: the materials shopping list. A successful product—one that performs well, is good value for money, and gives pleasure to the user—uses the best materials for the job, and fully exploits their potential and characteristics. It brings out their flavor, so to speak. The families of materials—metals, polymers, ceramics, and so forth—are introduced in Section 3.2. What do we need to know about them if we are to design with them? That is the subject of Section 3.3, in which distinctions are drawn between various types of materials information. But it is not, in the end, a material that we seek; it is a certain profile of properties—the one that best meets the needs of the design. Properties are the currency of the materials world. They are the bargaining chips—the way you trade off one material against another. The properties important in thermo-mechanical design are defined briefly in Section 3.4. It makes boring reading. The reader who is confident in the definitions and units of moduli, strengths, damping capacities, thermal and electrical conductivities, and the like, may wish to skip this, using it for reference, when needed, for the precise meaning and units of the data in the property charts that come later. Don’t, however, skip Section 3.2. It sets up the classification structure that is used throughout the book. The chapter ends, in the usual way, with a summary.\n \n 3.2 THE FAMILIES OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS It is conventional to classify the materials of engineering into the six broad families shown in Figure 3.1: metals, polymers, elastomers, ceramics, glasses, and hybrids. The members of a family have certain features in\n \n 3.2 The Families of Engineering Materials\n \n Steels Cast irons Al-alloys\n \n Metals Cu-alloys Zn-alloys Ti-alloys PE, PP, PET, PC, PS, PEEK PA (nylons)\n \n Aluminas Silicon carbides\n \n Ceramics\n \n Polymers\n \n Composites Sandwiches\n \n Silicon nitrides Zirconias\n \n Hybrids Segmented structures lattices foams\n \n Polyesters Phenolics Epoxies\n \n Soda glass Borosilicate glass\n \n Isoprene Neoprene Butyl rubber\n \n Glasses\n \n Elastomers\n \n Silica glass Glass-ceramics\n \n Natural rubber Silicones EVA\n \n FIGURE 3.1 The menu of engineering materials. The basic families of metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, and elastomers can be combined in various geometries to create hybrids.\n \n common: similar properties, similar processing routes, and, often, similar applications. Metals are stiff. They have relatively high elastic moduli. Most, when pure, are soft and easily deformed. They can be made strong by alloying and by mechanical and heat treatment, but they remain ductile, allowing them to be formed by deformation processes. Certain high-strength alloys (spring steel, for instance) have ductilities as low as 1%, but even this is enough to ensure that the material yields before it fractures and that fracture, when it occurs, is of a tough, ductile type. Partly because of their ductility, metals are prey to fatigue and of all the classes of material, they are the least resistant to corrosion. Ceramics, too, have high moduli, but unlike metal, they are brittle. Their “strength” in tension means the brittle fracture strength; in compression it is the brittle crushing strength, which is about 15 times greater. And because ceramics have no ductility, they have a low tolerance for stress concentrations (like holes or cracks) or for high-contact stresses (at clamping points, for instance). Ductile materials accommodate stress concentrations by deforming in a way that redistributes the load more evenly, and because of this, they can be used under static loads within a small margin of their yield strength. Ceramics cannot. Brittle materials always have a wide scatter in strength, and the strength itself depends on\n \n 33\n \n 34\n \n CHAPTER 3:\n \n Engineering Materials and Their Properties\n \n the volume of material under load and the time over which it is applied. So ceramics are not as easy to design with as metals. Despite this, they have attractive features. They are stiff, hard, and abrasion-resistant (hence their use for bearings and cutting tools); they retain their strength to high temperatures; and they resist corrosion well. Glasses are noncrystalline (“amorphous”) solids. The most common are the soda-lime and borosilicate glasses familiar as bottles and ovenware, but there are many more. Metals, too, can be made noncrystalline by cooling them sufficiently quickly. The lack of crystal structure suppresses plasticity, so, like ceramics, glasses are hard, brittle, and vulnerable to stress concentrations. Polymers are at the other end of the spectrum. They have moduli that are low, roughly 50 times lower than those of metals, but they can be strong— nearly as strong as metals. A consequence of this is that elastic deflections can be large. They creep, even at room temperature, meaning that a polymer component under load may, with time, acquire a permanent set. And their properties depend on temperature so that a polymer that is tough and flexible at 20°C may be brittle at the 4°C of a household refrigerator, yet may creep rapidly at the 100°C of boiling water. Few have useful strength above 200°C. Some polymers are mainly crystalline, some are amorphous (noncrystalline), some are a mix of crystalline and amorphous—transparency goes with the amorphous structure. If these aspects are allowed for in the design, the advantages of polymers can be exploited. And there are many. When combinations of properties, such as strength per unit weight, are important, polymers can compete with metals. They are easy to shape. Complicated parts performing several functions can be molded from a polymer in a single operation. The large elastic deflections allow the design of polymer components that snap together, making assembly fast and cheap. And by accurately sizing the mold and precoloring the polymer, no finishing operations are needed. Polymers resist corrosion (paints, for instance, are polymers) and have low coefficients of friction. Good design exploits these properties. Elastomers are long-chain polymers above their glass-transition temperature, Tg. The covalent bonds that link the units of the polymer chain remain intact, but the weaker Van der Waals and hydrogen bonds that, below Tg, bind the chains to each other, have melted. This gives elastomers unique properties: Young’s moduli as low as 10−3 GPa (105 times less than that typical of metals) increase with temperature (all other solids show a decrease), and have enormous elastic extension. Their properties differ so much from those of other solids that special tests have evolved to characterize them. This creates a problem: If we wish to select materials by prescribing a desired attribute profile, as we do later in this book, then a prerequisite is a set of attributes common to all materials.\n \n 3.3 Materials Information for Design\n \n To overcome this, we use a common set of properties in the early stages of design, estimating approximate values for anomalies like elastomers. Specialized attributes, representative of one family only, are stored separately; they are for use in the later stages. Hybrids are combinations of two or more materials in a predetermined configuration and scale. They combine the attractive properties of the other families of materials while avoiding some of their drawbacks. Their design is the subject of Chapters 11 and 12. The family of hybrids includes fiber and particulate composites, sandwich structures, lattice structures, foams, cables, and laminates; almost all the materials of nature—wood, bone, skin, and leaf—are hybrids. Fiber-reinforced composites are, of course, the most familiar. Most of those at present available to the engineer have a polymer matrix reinforced by fibers of glass, carbon, or Kevlar (an aramid). They are light, stiff, and strong, and they can be tough. They, and other hybrids using a polymer as one component, cannot be used above 250°C because the polymer softens, but at room temperature their performance can be outstanding. Hybrid components are expensive, and they are relatively difficult to form and join. So, despite their attractive properties, the designer will use them only when the added performance justifies the added cost. Today’s growing emphasis on high performance and fuel efficiency provides increasing drivers for their use. These, then, are the material families. What do we need to know about them?\n \n 3.3 MATERIALS INFORMATION FOR DESIGN The engineer, in selecting materials for a developing design, needs data for the materials’ properties. Engineers are often conservative in their choice, reluctant to consider materials with which they are unfamiliar, and with good reason. Data for the old, well-tried materials are established, reliable, and easily found. Data for newer, emerging, materials may be incomplete or untrustworthy. Yet innovation is often made possible by new materials. So it is important to know how to judge data quality. If you’re going to design something, what sort of materials information do you need? Figure 3.2 draws relevant distinctions. On the left a material is tested and the data are captured. But these raw data—unqualified numbers—are, for our purposes, useless. To make data useful requires statistical analysis. What is the mean value of the property when measured on a large batch of samples? What is the standard deviation? Given these, it is possible to calculate allowables: values of properties that, with a given certainty (say, one part in 106) can be guaranteed. Material texts generally present test data; by contrast, data in most engineering handbooks are allowables.\n \n 35\n \n 36\n \n CHAPTER 3:\n \n Engineering Materials and Their Properties\n \n Data capture\n \n Statistical analysis\n \n Design guidelines\n \n Economic analysis and business case\n \n Mechanical Properties Bulk modulus Compressive strength Ductility Elastic limit Endurance limit Fracture toughness Hardness Loss coefficient Modulus of rupture Poisson's ratio Shear modulus Tensile strength Young's modulus\n \n Test Raw data (Numbers)\n \n Test data\n \n 4.1 − 4.6 55 − 60 0.06 − 0.07 40 − 45 24 − 27 2.3 − 2.6 100 − 140 0.009 − 0.026 50 − 55 0.38 − 0.42 0.85 − 0.95 45 − 48 2.5 − 2.8\n \n Allowables Information (Numbers you understand)\n \n GPa MPa MPa MPa MPa.m1/2 MPa MPa GPa MPa GPa\n \n Profitable Potential applications applications Knowledge (Numbers you know how to use)\n \n FIGURE 3.2 Types of material information. We are interested here in the types found in the center of this schematic: structured data for design “allowables” and the characteristics of a material that relate to its ability to be formed, joined, and finished; records of experience with its use; and design guidelines for its use.\n \n One can think of data with known precision and provenance as information. Information can generally be reported as tables of numbers, as yes/no statements or as rankings: that is, it can be structured. Many attributes that can be structured are common to all materials; all have a density, an elastic modulus, a strength, a thermal conductivity. Structured information can be stored in a database and—since all materials have values—it is the starting point for selecting between them. The cover picture of this chapter shows part of a record for the polymer ABS with structured data on the left, reported as ranges that derive from differences in the way different producers make it. This is a step forward, but it is not enough. To design with a material, you need to know its real character, its strengths, and its weaknesses. How do you shape it? How do you join it? Who has used it before and for what? Did it fail? Why? This information exists in handbooks, is documented as design guidelines, and is reported in failure analyses and case studies. It consists largely of text, graphs and images, and while certain bits of it may be available for one material, for another they may not. It is messier, but it is essential in reaching a final selection. We refer to this supporting information as documentation. The image and text on the right of the ABS cover are examples of documentation. There is more. Material uses are subject to standards and codes. These rarely refer to a single material but to classes or subclasses. For a material to be used in contact with food or drugs, it must carry FDA approval or the equivalent. Metals and composites for use in U.S. military aircraft must have military\n \n 3.3 Materials Information for Design\n \n specification approval. To qualify for best-practice design for the environment, material usage must confirm to ISO 14040 guidelines. And so forth. This, too, is a form of documentation (Table 3.1). The ensemble of information about a material, structured and unstructured, constitutes knowledge. There is yet more (Figure 3.2, right). To succeed in the marketplace, a product must be economically viable and compete successfully, in terms of performance, consumer appeal, and cost, with the competition.

Much can be said about this, but not here; for now the focus is on structured data and documentation. That’s the essential background. Now for the properties themselves.\n \n 3.4 MATERIAL PROPERTIES AND THEIR UNITS Each material can be thought of as having a set of attributes or properties. The combination that characterizes a given material is its property profile. Property profiles are assembled by systematic testing. In this section we scan the nature of the tests and the definition and units of the properties (see Table 3.1). Property values are listed in Appendix A. Units are given here in the SI system. Conversion factors to other systems are printed on the inside front and back cover of the book.\n \n General properties The density, ρ (units: kg/m 3), is the mass per unit volume. We measure it today as Archimedes did: by weighing in air and in a fluid of known density. The price, Cm (units: $/kg), spans a wide range. Some cost as little as $0.2/kg, others as much as $1,000/kg. Prices, of course, fluctuate, and they depend on the quantity you want and on your status as a “preferred customer” with your chosen vendor. Despite this uncertainty, it is useful to have an approximate price in the early stages of material selection.\n \n Mechanical properties Ductile metals\n \n Tensile strength, σ ts\n \n Stress of order 500 MPa\n \n Stress σ = F/Ao\n \n 38\n \n Ao Of order 200 MPa Yield strength, σy\n \n L\n \n F\n \n * Strain of order 40%\n \n Slope E = σ /ε 0.2% offset\n \n Strain ε = δ L/L\n \n FIGURE 3.3 The stress-strain curve for a metal, showing the modulus, E, the 0.2% yield strength, σy, and the ultimate strength, σts.\n \n The elastic modulus, E (units: GPa or GN/m2), is the slope of the initial, linear-elastic, part of the stress-strain curve (Figure 3.3). Young’s modulus, E, describes response to tensile or compressive loading; the shear modulus, G, describes response to shear loading; and the bulk modulus, K, describes the response to hydrostatic pressure. Poisson’s ratio, ν, is the negative of the ratio of the lateral strain, ε2, to the axial strain, ε1, in axial loading: ν=−\n \n ε2 ε1\n \n 3.4 Material Properties and Their Units\n \n In reality, moduli measured as slopes of stress-strain curves are inaccurate, often low by a factor of 2 or more, because of contributions to the strain from inelasticity, creep, and other factors. Accurate moduli are measured dynamically: by exciting the natural vibrations of a beam or a wire or by measuring the velocity of sound waves in the material. In an isotropic material, the moduli are related in the following ways: E =\n \n 3G E G1⁄4 1 + G/3K 2ð1 + νÞ\n \n K1⁄4\n \n E 3ð1 − 2νÞ\n \n (3.1)\n \n Commonly, ν ≈ 1/3 when G≈\n \n 3 E 8\n \n and K ≈E\n \n (3.2a)\n \n Elastomers are exceptional. For these, ν ≈ 1/2 when G≈\n \n 1 E 3\n \n and K &gt;&gt; E\n \n (3.2b)\n \n Data sources like those described in Appendix D list values for all four moduli. In this book we examine data for E; approximate values for the others can be derived from the (3.2) equations when needed.\n \n Estimating moduli Young’s modulus E for copper is 124 GPa; its Poisson’s ratio ν is 0.345. What is its shear modulus, G?\n \n Answer Inserting the values for E and ν in the central equation (3.1) gives G = 46.1 GPa. The measured value is 45.6 GPa, a difference of only 1%.\n \n 39\n \n Engineering Materials and Their Properties\n \n The strength, σf (units: MPa or MN/m2), of a solid requires careful definition. For metals, we identify σ f with the 0.2% offset yield strength σ y (see Figure 3.3), that is, the stress at which the stress-strain curve for axial loading deviates by a strain of 0.2% from the linear-elastic line. It is the same in tension and compression. For polymers, σ f is identified as the stress at which the stress-strain curve becomes markedly nonlinear, at a strain typically of 1% (Figure 3.4). This may be caused by shear yielding: the irreversible slipping of molecular chains; or it may be caused by crazing: the formation of low-density, crack-like volumes that scatter light, making the polymer look white. Polymers are a little stronger (≈ 20%) in compression than in tension. Strength, for ceramics and glasses, depends strongly on the mode of loading (Figure 3.5). In tension, “strength” means the fracture strength, σt. In compression it means the crushing strength σ c , which is much greater; typically σ c = 10 to 15 σ t\n \n (3.3)\n \n When a material is difficult to grip, as is a ceramic, its strength can be measured in bending. The flexural strength or modulus of rupture, σflex (units: MPa) is the maximum surface stress in a bent beam at the instant of failure (Figure 3.6). One might expect this to be the same as the strength measured in tension, but for ceramics it is greater by a factor of about 1.3 because the volume subjected to this maximum stress is small and the probability of a large flaw lying in it is small also; in simple tension all flaws see the same stress.\n \n Brittle ceramics Ductile polymers\n \n *\n \n σf (compression) of order 3000 MPa\n \n Brittle: T &gt; Tg 1% strain\n \n Strain ε = δ L/L\n \n FIGURE 3.4 Stress-strain curves for a polymer below, at, and above its glass transition temperature, Tg.\n \n Stress σ = F/Ao\n \n CHAPTER 3:\n \n Stress σ = F/Ao\n \n 40\n \n Compression\n \n Slope E =σ /ε\n \n *\n \n Ao F\n \n L\n \n σt (tension) of order 300 MPa Tension\n \n Strain ε = δ L/ L\n \n FIGURE 3.5 Stress-strain curves for a ceramic in tension and in compression. The compressive strength, σc, is 10 to 15 times greater than the tensile strength, σt.\n \n 3.4 Material Properties and Their Units\n \n The strength of a composite is best defined by a set deviation from linear-elastic behavior; often an offset of 0.5% is taken. Composites that contain fibers, including natural composites such as wood, are a little weaker (up to 30%) in compression than tension because fibers buckle. In subsequent chapters, σ f for composites means the tensile strength.\n \n MOR\n \n *\n \n Ff\n \n Force F\n \n Force F b t\n \n L\n \n 3Ff L σ flex = = MOR 2b t 2 Deflection δ\n \n Strength, then, depends on material class and on mode of loading. Other modes of loading are possible: shear, for instance. Yield under multiaxial loads is related to that in simple tension by a yield function. For metals, the Von Mises yield function is a good description: FIGURE 3.6 The modulus of rupture (MOR) is the surface stress at failure in bending. It is equal to, or slightly larger than, the failure stress in tension.\n \n ðσ 1 − σ 2 Þ2 + ðσ 2 − σ 3 Þ2 + ðσ 3 − σ 1 Þ2 = 2 σ f 2\n \n (3.4)\n \n where σ 1 , σ 2 , and σ3 are the principal stresses, positive when tensile; σ1 , by convention, is the greatest or most positive; σ 3 , the smallest or least positive. For polymers the yield function is modified to include the effect of pressure:  2 2 2 2 2 1+βp ðσ 1 − σ 2 Þ + ðσ 2 − σ 3 Þ + ðσ 3 − σ 1 Þ = 2 σ f (3.5) K where K is the bulk modulus of the polymer, β ≈ 2 is a numerical coefficient that characterizes the pressure dependence of the flow strength, and the pressure p is defined by p = − 1 ðσ 1 + σ 2 + σ 3 Þ 3 For ceramics, a Coulomb flow law is used: σ 1 − Bσ 2 = C\n \n (3.6)\n \n where B and C are constants. The tensile (or ultimate) strength σ ts (units: MPa) is the nominal stress at which a round bar of the material, loaded in tension, separates (Figure 3.3). For brittle solids—ceramics, glasses, and brittle polymers—it is the same as the failure strength in tension. For metals, ductile polymers, and most composites, it is greater than the yield strength, σy, by a factor of between\n \n 41\n \n CHAPTER 3:\n \n Engineering Materials and Their Properties\n \n Using yield functions A metal pipe of radius r and wall thickness t carry an internal pressure p. The pressure generates a circumferential wall stress of σ1 = pr/t, an axial wall stress σ2 = pr/2t. At what pressure will the pipe first yield?\n \n Answer Setting σ 2 = σ 1 /2, σ 3 = 0 and σ f = σ y in Equation (3.4) gives the yield condition pffiffiffi 2 t σ 1 = ð2/ 3Þσ y . Thus the pressure p* that just causes first yield is p  = pffiffi r σ y . 3\n \n 1.1 and 3 because of work hardening or, in the case of composites, load transfer to the reinforcement. Cyclic loading can cause a crack to nucleate and grow in a material, culminating in fatigue failure. For many materials there exists a fatigue or endurance limit, σ e (units: MPa), illustrated by the Δσ − N f curve of Figure 3.7. It is the stress amplitude Δσ below which fracture does not occur, or occurs only after a very large number (Nf &gt; 107) of cycles. Tensile and compression tests are not always convenient: A large sample is needed and the test destroys it. The hardness test gives an approximate, nondestructive, measure of the strength. The hardness, H (SI units: MPa) of a material is measured by pressing a pointed diamond or hardened steel ball into the material’s surface (Figure 3.8). The hardness is defined as the indenter force divided by the projected area of the indent. It is related to the quantity we have defined as σf by\n \n Endurance limit\n \n Stress amplitude σa\n \n 42\n \n 1\n \n σmax\n \n σ ts\n \n Ao\n \n σa σm\n \n ∆σ\n \n 10\n \n Time\n \n 107 cycles\n \n 102 103 104 105 106 107 Cycles to failure Nf (log scale)\n \n H ≈ 3σ f\n \n (3.7)\n \n This, in the SI system, has units of MPa.

The translation Detailed modeling gets a little complicated, so let us start with some intelligent guesses (IGs). First, if the windings must carry load (the first constraint) they must be strong—the higher the strength, the greater the field they can tolerate. So (IG 1) we want materials with a high elastic limit σy. Second, a current i flowing for a time tp through a coil of resistance Re dissipates i2 Re tp joules of energy, and if this takes place in a volume V, the temperature rise is ΔT =\n \n i2 Re tp VCp ρ\n \n where Cp is the specific heat of the material and ρ is its density. So (IG 2) to maximize the current (and thus the field B) we need materials with low values of Re /Cp ρ or, since resistance Re is proportional to resistivity ρe for a fixed coil geometry, materials with low ρe /Cp ρ. Both guesses are correct. This has gotten us a long way; a simple search for material with high σ y —or rather low M1 = 1/σ y (since we must express objectives in a form to be minimized)—and low M2 = ρe /Cp ρ will find a sensible subset. The two are plotted in Figure 8.7 for some 1200 metals and alloys (ignore for the moment the black selection boxes). The materials with the best combination of indices lie along the lower envelope of the populated region. Strength is the dominant constraint when pulses are short, requiring materials\n \n 227\n \n 228\n \n CHAPTER 8:\n \n Case Studies: Multiple Constraints and Conflicting Objectives\n \n FIGURE 8.7 The two material groups that determine the choice of material for winding of high-powered magnets or electric motors. The axes are the two “guesses” made in the text—the modeling confirms the choice and allows precise positioning of the selection lines for a given pulse duration.\n \n with low M1; those near A are the best choice. Heating is the dominant constraint when pulses are long, and materials near B, with low M2, are the answer. This is progress, and it may be enough. If we want greater resolution, we must abandon guesswork (intelligent though it was) and apply min–max methods, requiring more detailed modeling. It gets a bit involved—if it looks too grim, skip to the next section, “The selection.” Consider first destruction by magnetic loading.

High-powered magnets are initially cooled in liquid nitrogen to –196°C in order to reduce the resistance of the windings; if the windings warm above room temperature, the resisðtance, R e , in general becomes too large. The entire energy of the pulse, i2 Re dt ≈ i2 Re tp is converted into heat (here Re is the average of the resistance over the heating cycle and tp is the length of the pulse); and since there is insufficient time for the heat to be conducted away, this energy causes the temperature of the coil to rise by ΔT, where ΔT =\n \n i2 Re tp ρe t p B2 = 2. 2 Cp ρV μo d C p ρ\n \n (8.19)\n \n Here ρe is the resistivity of the material of the windings, V its volume, Cp its specific heat (J/kg.K), and ρ its density.

But we have the same problem that appeared in the last case study—someone preselected the three materials in the table; surely there must be others? And the choice we reached is specific to a magnet with the dimensions listed above and a pulse time t p of 10 ms. What happens if we change these? We need the graphical method.

The axes, as already said, are the two indices M1 and M2. Three selections are shown, one for ultrashort-pulse magnets, the other two for longer pulses. Each selection box is a contour of constant field B; its corner lies on the coupling line for the appropriate pulse duration. The best choice, for a given pulse length, is that contained in the box that lies farthest down its coupling line. The results are summarized in Table 8.9.

We start with a simple example, revisiting the selection of materials for slender table legs. The translation The design requirements set down by Snr. Tavolino for his table (refer to Table 6.5) involved two objectives: that the leg be as light and as thin as possible. The mass m of a leg (Equation (6.8)) is proportional to M1 =\n \n ρ E1/2\n \n The thickness 2r (Equation (6.9)) scales with M2 =\n \n 1 E\n \n Snr. Tavolino wishes to minimize both. The selection The proper way to tackle multiobjective problems like this one is to make a trade-off plot. Figure 8.9 is an example: M1 on the vertical axis, M2 on the horizontal one. For clarity, only ferrous alloys, light alloys, composites, and woods appear on the plot—that set includes almost all materials that could be thought of as candidates. The classes cluster very tightly because both modulus and density have narrow ranges. Legs made of spruce or fir are potentially lighter than those made of any other material. Composites offer legs that are almost as light and much thinner. But, interestingly, they do not offer the thinnest of all—steel does\n \n Heavy\n \n 8.6 Conflicting Objectives: Wafer-thin Casings for Must-have Electronics\n \n 2000\n \n Thin but heavy\n \n M1 = ρ/E1/2 (kg/m3/GPa1/2 )\n \n 1000 AISI 1030 C-steel\n \n 500\n \n 200\n \n Heavy and thick\n \n Ti Steels alloys Mg Al alloys alloys\n \n Composites\n \n AISI 5140 LA steel White cast iron Ti-4Al-4Mo-2Sn Ti-8Al-1Mo-1V Al 8090 T8\n \n Woods\n \n Al 2090 T8 Carbon-polyester Carbon-SMC\n \n 100\n \n Epoxy-aramid\n \n Oak\n \n Spruce Fir\n \n Trade-off surface\n \n Willow\n \n Light\n \n 50 Thin and light\n \n Light but thick MFA, 09\n \n 20\n \n 10 −3 Thin\n \n 10 −2\n \n 10 −1\n \n M2 = 1/E (GPa −1)\n \n 1 Thick\n \n FIGURE 8.9 The trade-off plot for the table leg.

Overall, composites offer the best compromise—very low weight and attractive slenderness. Postscript But (as we asked in Section 6.4), wouldn’t a tubular leg be lighter? Fatter, but how much fatter? Wouldn’t the tubular solution be the best compromise? The answer will have to wait a little longer—until Section 10.5.

The ideal is a device that you can slip into a shirt pocket and not even know that it is there. The casing has to be stiff and strong enough to protect the electronics—the display, particularly—from damage. Casings used to be made of molded ABS or polycarbonate. To be stiff enough an ABS case has to be at least 2 mm thick,\n \n 233\n \n 234\n \n CHAPTER 8:\n \n Case Studies: Multiple Constraints and Conflicting Objectives\n \n too much for today’s designs in which thinness and lightness are very highly valued. But the consequences of making the casing too thin are severe: Mobile phones get sat on, and portable computers end up under piles of books. If the casing is insufficiently stiff, it flexes and damages the screen. The challenge: to identify materials for casings that are at least as stiff as a 2-mm ABS case but thinner and lighter. We must recognize that the thinnest may not be the lightest, and vice versa. A trade-off will be needed. Table 8.10 summarizes the requirements. The translation We idealize the loading on a panel of the casing in the way shown in the Figure 8.10. External loads cause it to bend. The bending stiffness is S=\n \n 48 EI L3\n \n I=\n \n Wt 3 12\n \n with (8.23)\n \n where E is Young’s modulus, I is the second moment of the area of the panel, and the dimensions L, W, and t are shown in the figure. The stiffness S must equal or exceed a design requirement S* if the panel is to perform its function properly. Combining the two equations and solving for the thickness t gives Equation (8.24).\n \n Table 8.10 The Design Requirements: Casing for Portable Electronics Function Constraints Objectives\n \n Free variables\n \n Light, thin (cheap) casing Bending stiffness S* specified Dimensions L and W specified Minimize thickness of casing Minimize mass of casing (Minimize material cost) Thickness t of casing wall Choice of material\n \n F w t L\n \n FIGURE 8.10 The casing can be idealized as a panel of dimensions L × W and thickness t, loaded in bending.\n \n 8.6 Conflicting Objectives: Wafer-thin Casings for Must-have Electronics\n \n \n \n S L3 4 EW\n \n t≥\n \n 1/3 (8.24)\n \n The thinnest panel is that made from the material with the smallest value of the index: 1 M1 = 1/3 E The mass of the panel per unit area, ma, is just ρt, where ρ is its density—the lightest panel is that made from the material with the smallest value of M2 =\n \n ρ\n \n (8.25)\n \n E1/3\n \n We use the existing ABS panel, stiffness S*, as the standard for comparison.

The solutions in sector A are both thinner and lighter than ABS, some by a factor of 2. Those in sector B and C are better by one metric but worse by the other. Those in sector D are worse by both. To narrow in on an optimal choice we sketch in a trade-off surface, shown as the broken line. The solutions nearest to this surface are, in terms of one metric or the other, good choices. Intuition guides us to those in or near Sector A. This is already enough to suggest choices that offer savings in thickness and in weight.

This is plotted for a selection of metals, polymers, and composites in Figure 8.12. ABS lies near the middle of the polymer group. CFRP, GFRP, titanium, aluminum, and magnesium all offer casings that have lower (better) values of Z*. The problem with this plot is that it is specific to a single value of the ratio αt /αm . If the relative importance of thinness and lightness are changed, the ranking changes too. We need a more general method. It is provided by constructing penalty contours on the trade-off plot. Two are shown as blue lines in Figure 8.11. The linear relationship of Equation (8.29) plots as a family of curves (not straight lines because of the log scales), with Z /αm decreasing toward the bottom left. The absolute value of Z  /αm does not matter—all we need it for is to identify the point at which a contour is tangent to the trade-off surface as shown in Figure 8.11. The solutions nearest this point are the optimum choices: CFRP, magnesium alloys, and Al-SiC composites.\n \n 8.7 Conflicting Objectives: Materials for a Disk-brake Caliper\n \n Penalty function\n \n Z∗ t m = + αm∗ to mo\n \n 5\n \n 4 W alloys TPS\n \n 3\n \n Cu alloys Cast iron Zn alloys\n \n 2\n \n Stainless steels Carbon steels\n \n PE\n \n ABS CA Epoxy Bulk molding PET PA PEEK compound Sheet molding PP PS compound PC Phenolics POM\n \n Ti alloys\n \n 1\n \n Al alloys Mg alloys\n \n Metals\n \n Search area minimizing Z∗\n \n Al-SiC MMC GFRP CFRP\n \n Polymers\n \n Composites\n \n 0\n \n FIGURE 8.12 The penalty function Z /αm when αt = αm .

Now titanium and even steel become attractive candidates. Postscript Back in 1997, when extreme thinness and lightness first became major design drivers, the conclusions reached here were new. At that time almost all casings for handheld electronics were made of ABS, polycarbonate, or, occasionally, steel. Now, 12 or more years later, examples of aluminum, magnesium, titanium, and even CFRP casings can be found in currently marketed products. The value of the case study (which dates from 1997) is as an illustration of the way in which systematic methods can be applied to multiobjective selection.

Here is another example—materials for the brake calipers of a Formula 1 racing car. The translation The brake caliper can be idealized as two beams of length L, depth b, and thickness h, locked together at their ends (see this chapter’s cover picture and Figure 8.13). Each beam is loaded in bending when the brake is applied, and because braking generates heat, it gets hot. The lower schematic represents one of the beams. Its length L and depth b are given. The beam stiffness S is critical: If it is inadequate the caliper will flex, impairing braking efficiency and allowing vibration. Its ability to transmit heat, too, is critical since part of the heat generated in braking must be conducted out through the caliper. Table 8.11 summarizes the requirements. The mass of the caliper scales with that of one of the beams. Its mass per unit area is simply ma = hρ ðunits: kg/m2 Þ\n \n (8.30)\n \n F Caliper\n \n Disk Brake pad F L Force F Beam depth b\n \n h Heat flow q driven by ∆T\n \n FIGURE 8.13 A schematic of a brake caliper.

We use this as a standard for comparison, normalizing Equations (8.34) and (8.35) by the values for cast iron (density ρ o , modulus E o , and conductivity λ o ), giving   1/3  ρ ma Eo = 1/2 ma,o ρo E\n \n (8.36)\n \n and 1/3 qa,o λ Eo = o 1/3 qa λE\n \n (8.37)\n \n The equation for qa has been inverted so that the best choice of material is that which minimizes both of these. Figure 8.14 shows a chart with these as axes. It is divided into four quadrants, centered on cast iron at the point (1,1). Each bubble describes a material. Those in the lower left are better than cast iron by both objectives; an aluminum caliper, for example, has half the weight and offers twice the heat transfer. The ultimate choice is beryllium or its alloy Be 40%Al.

The penalty function is plotted in Figure 8.14 for three values of the ratio αq /αm of the exchange constants. Each is tangent to a trade-off surface that excludes the “exotic” beryllium alloys, which otherwise dominate the selection for all values. For αq /αm = 0:1, meaning mass reduction is of prime importance, magnesium alloys are the best choice. If mass reduction and heat transfer are given equal weight (αq /αm = 1), aluminum alloys become a good choice. If heat transfer is the overriding consideration (αq /αm = 10), alloys based on copper win.

But although they conflict, an optimum selection is still possible. The “active constraint” method, developed in Chapter 7, allows the selection of materials that optimally meet two or more constraints. It is illustrated here by three case studies, two of them mechanical, one electro-mechanical. Greater challenges arise when the design must meet two or more conflicting objectives (such as minimizing mass, volume, cost, and environmental impact).

The conversion factors are called the “exchange constants.” Establishing the value of the exchange constant is an important step in solving the problem. With it, a penalty function Z can be constructed that combines the objectives. Materials that minimize Z meet all the objectives in a properly balanced way. The most obvious common currency is cost itself, requiring an “exchange rate” to be established between cost and the other objectives. This can be done for mass and—at least in principle—for other objectives too. The method is illustrated by three further case studies.\n \n CHAPTER 9\n \n Selection of Material and Shape\n \n Extruded shapes.

A material has a modulus and a strength, but it can be made stiffer and stronger when loaded in bending or twisting by shaping it into an I-beam or a hollow tube. It can be made less stiff by flattening it into a flat leaf or winding it, in the form of wire, into a helix. Thinned shapes help dissipate heat; cellular shapes help conserve it. There are shapes to maximize electrical capacitance and to conserve magnetic field; shapes that control optical reflection, diffraction, and refraction; shapes to reflect a sound, and shapes to absorb it. Shape is even used to change the way a material feels, making it smooth or rough, slippery or grippy. And of course, it is shape that distinguishes the Venus de Milo from the marble block from which she was carved. It is a rich subject. Here we explore one part of it—the way shape can be used to increase the mechanical efficiency of a material. Shaped sections carry bending, torsional, and axial-compressive loads more efficiently than do solid sections. By “shaped” we mean that the cross-section is formed as a tube, a box section, an I-section, or the like. By “efficient” we mean that, for given loading conditions, the section uses as little material as possible. Tubes, boxes, and I-sections will be referred to as “simple shapes.” Even greater efficiencies are possible with sandwich panels (thin load-bearing skins bonded to a foam or honeycomb interior) and with more elaborate structures (the Warren truss, for instance). This chapter extends selection methods so as to include shape (Figure 9.1). Often this is not needed: In the Case Studies of Chapter 6, shape either did not enter at all, or, when it did, it was not a variable (that is, we compared different materials with the same shape). But when two different materials are available,\n \n 9.1 Introduction and Synopsis\n \n Function Translation, giving Constraints Objectives for selection Shape\n \n Material\n \n Shape factors Indices that include shape Coselection of material + shape\n \n Material families classes, members Material attributes and documenttion\n \n Process\n \n FIGURE 9.1 Section shape is important for certain modes of loading. When shape is a variable, a new term—the shape factor φ—appears in some of the material indices.\n \n each with its own section shape, the more general problem arises: how to choose the best combination from among the vast range of materials and the section shapes that are available or could potentially be made. Take the example of a bicycle: Its forks are loaded in bending. They could, say, be made of steel or of wood—early bikes were made of wood. But steel is available as a thin-walled tube whereas wood is not; wood components, usually, are solid. A solid wood bicycle is certainly lighter for the same stiffness than a solid steel one, but is it lighter than one made of steel tubing? Might a magnesium I-section be lighter still? How, in short, is one to choose the best combination of material and shape? A procedure for answering these and related questions is developed in this chapter. It involves the definition of shape factors. A material can be thought of as having properties but no shape. A structure is a material made into a shape (Figure 9.2). Shape factors are measures of the efficiency of material usage. Further, they enable the definition of material indices, such as those of Chapter 5, but now include shape. When shape is constant, the indices reduce + = exactly to those of Chapter 5; when shape is a variable, however, the shape factor appears in the expresMaterial Shape Shaped material sions for the indices. They let you compare shaped materials and guide the choice of the best combina- FIGURE 9.2 tion of material and shape.

Thus ties\n \n 9.2 Shape Factors\n \n carry tensile loads; beams carry bending moments; shafts carry torques; columns carry compressive axial loads. Figure 9.3 shows these modes of loading applied to shapes that resist them well. The point it makes is that the best material-shape combination depends on the mode of loading. In what follows, we separate the modes, dealing with each separately. In axial tension, the area of the cross-section is important but its shape is not: All sections with the same area will carry the same load.

Torsion, too, has its efficient shapes: Circular tubes, for instance, are more efficient than either solid sections or I-sections. To characterize this we need a metric—a way of measuring the structural efficiency of a section shape, independent of the material of which it is made. An obvious metric is that given by the ratio φ (phi) of the stiffness or strength of the shaped section to that of a “neutral” reference shape, which we take to be that of a solid square section with the same cross-sectional area A, and thus the same mass per unit length m l , as the shaped section (Figure 9.4). Elastic bending of beams The bending stiffness S of a beam (Figure 9.3b) is proportional to the product EI S∝\n \n EI 3 L\n \n Here E is Young’s modulus and I is the second moment of area of the beam of length L about the axis of bending (the x axis): I=∫\n \n y2 dA\n \n (9.1)\n \n section\n \n where y is measured normal to the bending axis and dA is the differential element of area at y. Values of the moment I and of the area A for common sections are listed in the first two columns of Table 9.2.

The three members of each horizontal group differ in scale but have the same shape factor— each member is a magnified or shrunken version of its neighbors. Shape-efficiency factors φeB for common shapes in bending, calculated from the expressions for A and I in Table 9.2, are listed in the first column of Table 9.3. Solid equi-axed sections (circles, squares, hexagons, octagons) all have values very close to 1—for practical purposes they can be set equal to 1. But if the section is elongated, hollow, or of I-section, things change; a thin-walled tube or a slender I-beam can have a value of 50 or more. A beam with φeB = 50 is 50 times stiffer than a solid beam of the same weight. Figure 9.6 is a plot of I against A for values of φeB (Equation (9.3)). The contour for φeB = 1 describes the square-section reference beam. Those for φeB = 10 and φeB = 100 describe more efficient shapes, as suggested by the icons at the bottom left, in each of which the axis of bending is horizontal. But it is not always high stiffness that is wanted. Springs, cradles, suspensions, cables, and other structures that must flex yet have high tensile strength rely on having a low bending stiffness. Then we want low shape efficiency. It is achieved by spreading the material in a plane containing the axis of bending to form sheets or wires, as suggested by the contours for φeB = 0:1 and 0.01. 1 This elastic shape-efficiency factor is related to the radius of gyration, Rg, by φeB = 12R2g /A. It is related to the “shape parameter,” k1, of Shanley (1960) by φeB = 12k1 .\n \n 9.2 Shape Factors\n \n Calculating shape factors A tube has a radius r = 10 mm and a wall thickness t = 1 mm. How much stiffer is it in bending than a solid cylinder of the same mass per unit length ml ?\n \n Answer The difference is the ratio of the two shape factors. The shape factor for the tube, from\n \n  Table 9.3, is φeB = π3 rt = 9:55: That for a solid circular section is φeB = π3 = 0:955: The tube is stiffer by a factor of 10.\n \n Elastic twisting of shafts (Figure 9.3(c)) Shapes that resist bending well may not be so good when twisted. The stiffness of a shaft—the torque T divided by the angle of twist θ—is proportional to GK, where G is its shear modulus and K is its torsional moment of area. For circular sections, K is identical with the polar moment of area J: J=∫\n \n r 2 dA\n \n φBe = 2\n \n (a)\n \n φBe = 10\n \n (9.4) (b)\n \n section\n \n where dA is the differential element of area at the radial distance r, measured from the center of the section. For noncircular sections, K is less than J; it is defined such that the angle of twist θ is related to the torque T by ST =\n \n T = KG θ L\n \n (9.5)\n \n where L is the length of the shaft and G is the shear modulus of the material of which it is made. Approximate expressions for K are listed in Table 9.2.\n \n φBe = 15\n \n (c)\n \n FIGURE 9.5 (a) A set of rectangular sections with φeB = 2. (b) A set of I-sections with φeB = 10. (c) A set of tubes with φeB = 15. Members of a set differ in size but not in shape.\n \n The shape factor for elastic twisting is defined, as before, by the ratio of the torsional stiffness of the shaped section ST to that of a solid square shaft STo of the same length L and cross-section A, which, using Equation (9.5), is φeT =\n \n ST K = Ko STo\n \n (9.6)\n \n 251\n \n 252\n \n CHAPTER 9:\n \n Selection of Material and Shape\n \n Table 9.3 Shape-efficiency Factors Section Shape\n \n h\n \n Bending Factor φeB\n \n Torsional Factor φeT\n \n Bending Factor φfB\n \n h b\n \n h b   b 1 − 0:58 ðh &gt; bÞ h\n \n  0:5 h b\n \n 2 pffiffiffi = 1:15 3\n \n 0.832\n \n 31/4 = 0:658 2\n \n 0.83\n \n 3 = 0:955 π\n \n 1.14\n \n 3 pffiffiffi = 0:846 2 π\n \n 1.35\n \n 3 a π b\n \n 2:28 a b ða2 + b2 Þ\n \n 3 pffiffiffi 2 π\n \n rffiffiffi a b\n \n  3 r ðr &gt;&gt; tÞ π t\n \n  1:14 r t\n \n 3 pffiffiffiffiffiffi 2π\n \n rffiffi r t\n \n 1 h ð1 + 3b/hÞ 2 t ð1 + b/hÞ2 ðh,b &gt;&gt; t\n \n   t 4 3:57b2 1 − h  3 b th 1+ h\n \n 2:38\n \n Torsional Factor φfT rffiffiffi b 1 1:6   h 1 + 0:6 b h ðh &gt; bÞ\n \n b\n \n a\n \n a\n \n 2r\n \n 2a\n \n 1:35\n \n rffiffiffi a ða &lt; bÞ b\n \n 2b\n \n t\n \n 2ri\n \n 2ro\n \n t h\n \n rffiffi 1:91 r t\n \n   rffiffiffi 1 + 3b h 1 h pffiffiffi 3/2  2 t b 1+ h\n \n 3:39\n \n   rffiffiffi 1 + 3b a 3 a pffiffiffi 3/2  2 π t 1+ b a\n \n 5:41\n \n rffiffiffiffiffi h2 bt\n \n 1 1+\n \n h b\n \n 3/2\n \n b\n \n t 2a\n \n 2b\n \n 3 a ð1 + 3b/aÞ π t ð1 + b/aÞ2 ða,b &gt;&gt; t\n \n 9:12 ða bÞ\n \n 5/2\n \n tða2 + b2 Þða + bÞ2\n \n rffiffiffi a t\n \n 1 1+\n \n t hi b\n \n ho\n \n 2 3 ho ðh,b &gt;&gt; tÞ 2 bt\n \n –\n \n 3 ho pffiffiffi pffiffiffiffiffi 2 bt\n \n –\n \n a b\n \n 3/2\n \n 9.2 Shape Factors\n \n Table 9.3 continued Section Shape t 2t\n \n h\n \n Bending Factor φeB\n \n Torsional Factor φeT\n \n Bending Factor φfB\n \n Torsional Factor φfT\n \n \n \n 1 h ð1 + 3b/hÞ 2 t ð1 + b/hÞ2 ðh,b &gt;&gt; tÞ\n \n  4h 1 +   b 1:19 t  2 b 1+ h b\n \n   rffiffiffi 1 + 3b h 1 h pffiffiffi 3/2  2 t b 1+ h\n \n   rffiffiffi 1 + 4h b 1:13 t  3/2 b h 1+ b\n \n  8b 1 +   h t 0:595  2 h b 1+ h\n \n   2 rffiffiffi 1 + 4bt h3 3 h 3/2 4 t b 1+ h\n \n   rffiffiffi 1 + 8b h 0:565 t  3/2 h b 1+ h\n \n   4b   1+ t h 1:19 h ð1 + bÞ2 h\n \n   2 rffiffiffi 1 + 4bt h3 3 h 3/2 4 t b 1+ h\n \n   rffiffiffi 1 + 4b h 1:13 t  3/2 h b 1+ h\n \n b\n \n \n \n 2 3 1 h ð1 + 4bt /h Þ 2 t ð1 + b/hÞ2 ðh,b≫tÞ\n \n 2t h 2t\n \n 2t h t\n \n 2 3 1 h ð1 + 4bt /h Þ 2 t ð1 + b/hÞ2 ðh,b &gt;&gt; tÞ\n \n b\n \n 10−1 φ Be = 100\n \n Elastic bending\n \n 10\n \n 1\n \n Second moment of area I (m4)\n \n 10−2 10−3\n \n Structural steel sections\n \n 0.1 0.01\n \n 10−4 10−5\n \n Structural timber sections\n \n 10−6 10−7 Extruded aluminium sections\n \n 10−8 10−9 10−4\n \n 10−3\n \n 10−2 Section area A (m2)\n \n 10−1\n \n 1\n \n FIGURE 9.6 The second moment of area I plotted against section area A.

Real structural sections have values of I and A that lie in the shaded zones. Note that there are limits on A and on the maximum shape efficiency φeB that depend on material.\n \n 253\n \n 254\n \n CHAPTER 9:\n \n Selection of Material and Shape\n \n The torsional constant K o for a solid square section (Table 9.2, top row with b = h) is ko = 0:14 A2 giving φeT = 7:14\n \n K A2\n \n (9.7)\n \n It, too, has the value 1 for a solid square section, and has values near 1 for any solid, equi-axed section; but for thin-walled shapes, particularly tubes, it can be large. As before, sections with the same value of φeT differ in size but not shape. Values derived from the expressions for K and A in Table 9.2 are listed in Table 9.3. Failure in bending Plasticity starts when the stress, somewhere, first reaches the yield strength σy; fracture occurs when this stress first exceeds the fracture strength σ fr ; fatigue failure, if it exceeds the endurance limit σ e . Any one of these constitutes failure. As in earlier chapters, we use the symbol σf for the failure stress, meaning “the local stress that will first cause yielding or fracture or fatigue failure.” In bending, the stress σ is largest at the point ym on the surface of the beam that lies furthest from the neutral axis. Its value is σ=\n \n M ym M = I Z\n \n (9.8)\n \n where M is the bending moment. Failure occurs when this stress first exceeds σ f . Thus, in problems of beam failure, shape enters through the f section modulus, Z = I/ym. The strength efficiency of the shaped beam φB is measured by the ratio Z/Zo, where Zo is the section modulus of a reference beam of square section with the same cross-sectional area, A: Zo =\n \n b3o A3/2 = 6 6\n \n (9.9)\n \n Z 6Z = 3/2 Zo A\n \n (9.10)\n \n Thus, f\n \n φB =\n \n Like the other shape-efficiency factor, it is dimensionless and therefore f independent of scale. As before, φB = 1 describes the square-section f reference beam. Table 9.3 gives expressions for φB for other shapes derived from the values of the section modulus, Z, in Table 9.2. A beam with a failure shape-efficiency factor of 10 is 10 times stronger in bending than a solid square section of the same weight. Figure 9.7 is a plot of Z against A for f values of φB (Equation (9.10)). The other contours describe shapes that are more or less efficient, as suggested by the icons.\n \n 9.2 Shape Factors\n \n 10−1\n \n φ Bf = 100\n \n Plastic bending\n \n 10\n \n 1\n \n Section modulus Z (m3 )\n \n 10−2\n \n 0.1\n \n Structural steel sections 10−3\n \n 0.01 10−4\n \n Structural timber sections\n \n 10−5\n \n 10−6\n \n 10−7 10−4\n \n Extruded aluminum sections\n \n 10−3\n \n 10−2 Section area A (m2 )\n \n 10−1\n \n 1\n \n FIGURE 9.7 The section modulus Z plotted against section area A.

Real structural sections have values of Z and A that lie in the shaded zones. Note that there are limits on A and on the maximum shape efficiency φfB that depend on material.\n \n Evaluating shape factors A beam has a square-box section with a height h = 100 mm, a width b = 100 mm, and a wall thickness t = 5 mm. What is the value of its shape factor φfB ?   Answer qffiffi 1 + 3b h f 1ffiffi h p The shape factor for the box section, from Table 9.3, is φB = 2 t  3/2 = 4:47. The b 1+ h\n \n box section is stronger than a solid square-section beam of the same mass per unit length by a factor of 4.5.\n \n Failure in torsion In torsion the problem is more complicated. For circular rods or tubes subjected to a torque T (as in Figure 9.3(c)) the shear stress τ is a maximum at the outer surface, at the radial distance rm from the axis of bending: τ=\n \n Trm J\n \n (9.11)\n \n 255\n \n 256\n \n CHAPTER 9:\n \n Selection of Material and Shape\n \n The quantity J/rm , in twisting has the same character as I/ym in bending. For noncircular sections with ends that are free to warp, the maximum surface stress is given instead by τ= T Q\n \n (9.12)\n \n where Q, with units of m 3, now plays the role in torsion that Z plays in f bending. This allows the definition of a shape factor, φT , for failure in torsion, following the same pattern as before: f\n \n φT =\n \n Q Q = 4:8 3/2 Qo A\n \n (9.13)\n \n f\n \n Values of Q and φT are listed in Tables 9.2 and 9.3. Shafts with solid f equiaxed sections all have values of φT close to 1. Fully plastic bending or twisting (such that the yield strength is exceeded throughout the section) involves a further pair of shape factors. Generally speaking, shapes that resist the onset of plasticity well are resistant to full pl f plasticity also, so φB does not differ much from φB . New shape factors for these are not, at this stage, necessary. Axial loading: Column buckling A column of length L, loaded in compression, buckles elastically when the load exceeds the Euler load Fc =\n \n n2 π 2 E Imin L\n \n 2\n \n (9.14)\n \n Inreasing strength by shaping A slender, solid cylindrical column of height L supports a load F. If overloaded, the column fails by elastic buckling. By how much is the load-bearing capacity increased if the solid cylinder is replaced by a hollow circular tube of the same cross-section A?\n \n Answer Replacing Imin in Equation 9.14 by φeB A2 /12 from Equation 9.3 gives Fc =\n \n n 2 π 2 A2 E φeB 12 L2\n \n The failure load is increased by the ratio of the shape factor for the tube to the shape factor of the solid cylinder. The shape factor for a thin-walled tube is φeB = 3 r /π t; for the solid cylinder it is φeB = 3/π (Table 9.3). The ratio is r/t, where r is the radius and t is the wall thickness of the tube.\n \n 9.3 Limits to Shape Efficiency\n \n where n is a constant that depends on the end-constraints. The resistance to buckling, then, depends on the smallest second moment of area, Imin, and the appropriate shape factor (φeB ) is the same as that for elastic bending (Equation (9.3)) with I replaced by Imin.\n \n 9.3 LIMITS TO SHAPE EFFICIENCY The conclusions so far: If you wish to make stiff, strong structures that are efficient (using as little material as possible), make the shape-efficiency factors as large as possible. It would seem, then, that the bigger the value of φ the better. True, but there are limits. We examine these next. Empirical limits There are practical limits for the slenderness of sections, and these determine, for a given material, the maximum attainable efficiencies. These limits may be imposed by manufacturing constraints: The difficulty or expense of making an efficient shape may simply be too great. More often they are imposed by the properties of the material itself because these determine the failure mode of the section. We explore these limits in two ways. The first is empirical: by examining the shapes in which real materials—steel, aluminum, and so on—are actually made, recording the limiting efficiency of available sections. The second is by the analysis of the mechanical stability of shaped sections. Standard sections for beams, shafts, and columns are generally prismatic. Prismatic shapes are easily made by rolling, extrusion, drawing, pultrusion, or sawing (see the chapter opening picture). The section may be solid, closed-hollow (like a tube or box), or open-hollow (an I-, U-, or L-section, for instance). Each class of shape can be made in a range of materials. Some are available as standard, off-the-shelf sections, notably structural steel, extruded aluminum alloy, pultruded GFRP (glass fiber reinforced polyester, or epoxy), and structural timber. Figure 9.8 shows values for I and A (the same axes as in Figure 9.6) for 1,880 standard sections made from these four materials, with contours of the shape factor φeB superimposed. Some of the sections have φeB ≈ 1; they are the ones with solid cylindrical or square sections. More interesting is that none have values of φeB greater than about 65; there is an upper limit for the shape. A similar plot for Z and f A (the axes of Figure 9.7) indicates an upper limit for φB of about 15. When these data are segregated by material, 2 it is found that each has its own upper limit of shape and that they differ greatly. Similar limits hold for the torsional shape factors. They are listed in Table 9.4 and were plotted as shaded bands on Figures 9.6 and 9.7. 2\n \n Birmingham &amp; Jobling (1996); Weaver &amp; Ashby (1997).\n \n 257\n \n 258\n \n CHAPTER 9:\n \n Selection of Material and Shape\n \n FIGURE 9.8 Log (I ) plotted against log (A) for standard sections of steel, aluminum, pultruded GFRP, and wood.

The best choice of material depends on the shapes in which it is available or to which it could potentially be formed. The procedure of Chapter 9 gives a method for optimizing the coupled choice of material and shape.\n \n 10.9 Summary and Conclusions\n \n The procedure is illustrated in this chapter. Often the designer has available certain stock materials in certain shapes. If so, the one with the greatest value of the appropriate material index (of which a number were listed in Table 10.1) maximizes performance. Sometimes sections can be specially designed; then material properties and design loads determine a maximum practical value for the shape factor above which local buckling leads to failure; again, the procedure gives an optimal choice of material and shape. Further gains in efficiency are possible by combining microscopic with macroscopic shape—something we return to later.\n \n 297\n \n CHAPTER 11\n \n Designing Hybrid Materials\n \n Composite structure\n \n Sandwich structure\n \n Segmented structure\n \n Cellular structure\n \n Hybrid materials.\n \n Materials Selection in Mechanical Design.

Why do farmers prefer hybrid corn to the natural strain? Mules, after all, are best known for their stubbornness, and—like hybrid corn—they cannot reproduce, so you have to start again for each generation. So—why? Because, although they have some attributes that are not as good as those of their forbears, they have others—hardiness, strength, resistance to disease—that are better. The botanical phrase “hybrid vigor” sums it up. So let us explore the idea of hybrid materials—combinations of two or more materials assembled in such a way as to have attributes not offered by either one alone (Figure 11.1, central circle). Like the mule, we may find that some attributes are less good (the cost, for example), but if the ones we want are better, something is achieved. Particulate and fibrous composites are examples of one type of hybrid, but there are many others: sandwich structures, lattice structures, segmented structures, and more. Here we explore ways of designing hybrid materials, emphasizing the choice of components, their configuration, their relative volume fraction, and their scale (Table 11.1). The new variables expand design space, allowing the creation of new “materials” with specific property profiles. And that highlights one of the challenges. How are we to compare a hybrid like a sandwich with monolithic materials like, say, polycarbonate or titanium? To do this we must think of the sandwich not only as a hybrid\n \n 11.1 Introduction and Synopsis\n \n Steels Cast irons Al-alloys\n \n Metals Cu-alloys Zn-alloys Ti-alloys PE, PP, PET, PC, PS, PEEK PA (nylons)\n \n Aluminas Silicon carbides\n \n Ceramics\n \n Polymers\n \n Composites Sandwiches\n \n Silicon nitrides Zirconias\n \n Polyesters Phenolics Epoxies\n \n Hybrids Cellular structures Segmented structures\n \n Soda glass Borosilicate glass\n \n Isoprene Neoprene Butyl rubber\n \n Glasses\n \n Elastomers\n \n Silica glass Glass ceramics\n \n Natural rubber Silicones EVA\n \n FIGURE 11.1 Hybrid materials combine the properties of two (or more) monolithic materials or of one material and space.

The approach adopted here is one of breadth rather than precision. The aim is to assemble methods to allow the properties of alternative hybrids to be scanned and compared, seeking those that best meet a given set of design requirements. Once materials and configuration have been chosen, standard methods such as optimization routines and finite element analyses can be used to refine them. But what the standard methods are not good at is the quick scan of alternative combinations. That is where the approximate methods developed below, in which material and configuration become the variables, pay off.\n \n 301\n \n 302\n \n CHAPTER 11:\n \n Designing Hybrid Materials\n \n FIGURE 11.2 Four configurations for a bridge. The design variables describing the performance of each differ. Optimization of performance becomes possible only when a configuration has been chosen.\n \n The word “configuration” requires elaboration. Figure 11.2 shows four different configurations of bridge. In the first all members are loaded in compression. In the second, members carry both tension and compression, depending on how the bridge is loaded. In the third and fourth, the suspension cables are loaded purely in tension. Any one of these can be optimized, but no amount of optimization will cause one to evolve into another because this involves a discrete jump in configuration, each characterized by its own set of variables.1 Hybrid design has the same feature: The classes of hybrid are distinguished by their configuration. Here we focus on four classes, each with a number of discrete members. The images on the first page of this chapter suggest what they look like. To avoid a mouthful of words every time we refer to one, we use the shorthand: composite, sandwich, cellular, and segmented structures. Composites combine two solid components, one (the reinforcement) as fibers or particles, contained in the other (the matrix). Their properties are some average of those of the components, and, on a scale large compared to that of the reinforcement, they behave as if they were homogeneous materials. Sandwiches have outer faces of one material supported by a core of another, usually a low-density material—a configuration that gives a flexural stiffness per unit weight that is greater than that offered by either component alone. 1 Numerical tools are emerging that allow a degree of topological optimization, that is, the development of a configuration. They work like this. Start with an envelope—a set of boundaries—and fill it with a homogenous “material” with a relative density initially set at 0.5, with properties that depend linearly on relative density. Impose constraints, meaning the mechanical, thermal, and other loads the structure must support, give it a criterion of excellence, and let it condense out into regions of relative density 1 and regions where it is 0 retaining only changes that increase the measure of excellence. The method is computationally intensive but has had some success in suggesting configurations that use a material efficiently (see “Further reading” for more information).\n \n 11.2 Holes in Material-property Space\n \n Cellular structures are combinations of material and space (which can, of course, be filled with another material). We distinguish two types: In the first, the low connectivity of the struts allows them to bend when the lattice is loaded; in the other, the higher connectivity suppresses bending, forcing the struts to stretch. Segmented structures are materials subdivided in one, two, or three dimensions; the subdivisions both lower the stiffness and, by dividing the material into discrete units, impart damage tolerance. The approach we adopt is to use bounding methods to estimate the properties of each configuration. With these, the properties of a given pair of materials in a given configuration can be calculated. These can then be plotted on material selection charts, which become tools for selecting both configuration and material.\n \n 11.2 HOLES IN MATERIAL-PROPERTY SPACE All the charts of Chapter 4 have one thing in common: Parts of them are populated with materials and parts are not—there are holes (Figure 11.3). Some parts are inaccessible for fundamental reasons that relate to the size of atoms and the nature of the forces that bind them together. But other parts are empty even though, in principle, they could be filled. Is anything to be gained by developing materials (or material combinations) that lie in these holes? The material indices show where this is profitable. A grid of lines of one index—E/ρ—is plotted in Figure 11.3. If the filled areas can be expanded in the direction of the arrow (i.e., to greater values of E/ρ) it will enable lighter, stiffer structures to be made. The arrow lies normal to the index lines. It defines a vector for material development. One approach to filling holes—the long-established one—is that of developing new metal alloys, new polymer chemistries, and new compositions of glass and ceramic so as to extend the populated areas of the property charts; Figure 1.2 illustrated how this has evolved over time. But developing new materials can be an expensive and uncertain process, and the gains tend to be incremental rather than step-like. An alternative is to combine two or more existing materials so as to allow a superposition of their properties—in short, to create hybrids. The spectacular success of carbon and glass-fiber–reinforced composites at one extreme, and of foamed materials at another (hybrids of material and space) in filling previously empty areas of the property charts is encouragement enough to explore ways in which such hybrids can be designed. What might we hope to achieve? Figure 11.4 shows two materials, M1 and M2, plotted on a chart with properties P1 and P2 as axes. The figure shows four scenarios, each typical of a certain class of hybrid. Depending on the\n \n 303\n \n 304\n \n CHAPTER 11:\n \n Designing Hybrid Materials\n \n FIGURE 11.3 Holes in modulus-density space, with contours of specific modulus E /ρ. Material development that extended the occupied territory in the direction of the arrow (the “vector for development”) allows components with greater stiffness to weight than any current material allows.\n \n configuration of the materials and the way they are combined, we may find any one of the following. ■\n \n ■\n \n “The best of both” scenario. The ideal is often the creation of a hybrid with the best properties of both components. There are examples, most commonly when a bulk property of one material is combined with the surface properties of another. Zinc-coated steel has the strength and toughness of steel with the corrosion resistance of zinc. Glazed pottery exploits the formability and low cost of clay with the impermeability and durability of glass. “The rule of mixtures” scenario. When bulk properties are combined in a hybrid, as in structural composites, the best that can be obtained is often the arithmetic average of the properties of the components, weighted by\n \n 11.3 The Method: “A + B + Configuration + Scale”\n \n ■\n \n These set certain fixed points, but the list is not exhaustive. Other combinations are possible. These will emerge in the following.\n \n Material Greatest of both\n \n M1\n \n Property P2\n \n ■\n \n their volume fractions. Thus unidirectional fiber composites have an axial modulus (the one parallel to the fibers) that lies close to the rule of mixtures. “The weaker link dominates” scenario. Sometimes we have to live with a lesser compromise, typified by the stiffness of particulate composites, in which the hybrid properties fall below those of a rule of mixtures, lying closer to the harmonic than the arithmetic mean of the properties. Although the gains are less spectacular, they are still useful. “The least of both” or weakest-link scenario. Sometimes it is not the greatest but the least of the properties that we seek. Fire sprinkler systems, for example, use a wax-metal hybrid designed to fail, releasing the spray when the melting point of the lower-melting material (the wax) is exceeded.\n \n Rule of mixtures Harmonic mean Least of both\n \n M2 Material Property P1\n \n FIGURE 11.4 The possibilities of hybridization. The properties of the hybrid reflect those of its component materials, combined in one of several possible ways.\n \n When is a hybrid a “material”? There is a certain duality in how hybrids are considered and discussed. Some, like filled polymers, composites, or wood are treated as materials in their own right, each characterized by its own set of material properties. Others, such as galvanized steel, are seen as one material (steel) to which a coating of a second (zinc) has been applied, even though it could be regarded as a new material with the strength of steel but the surface properties of zinc (“stinc,” perhaps?). Sandwich panels illustrate the duality, sometimes viewed as two sheets of face material separated by a core material, and sometimes—to allow comparison with bulk materials—as “materials” with their own density, flexural stiffness, and strength. To call any one of these a “material” and to characterize it as such is a useful shorthand, allowing designers to use existing methods when designing with them. But if we are to design the hybrid itself, we must deconstruct it and think of it as a combination of materials (or of material and space) in a chosen configuration.\n \n 11.3 THE METHOD: “A + B + CONFIGURATION + SCALE” First, a working definition: A hybrid material is a combination of two or more materials in a predetermined configuration, relative volume, and scale, optimally serving a specific engineering purpose,” which we paraphrase as “A + B + configuration + scale.” Here we allow for the widest possible choice of A and\n \n 305\n \n 306\n \n CHAPTER 11:\n \n Designing Hybrid Materials\n \n B, including the possibility that one of them is a gas or simply space. These new design variables expand design space, allowing an optimization of properties that is not possible if the choice is limited to single, monolithic materials. The basic idea, illustrated in Figure 11.5, is this. Monolithic materials offer a certain portfolio of properties on which much engineering design is based. Design requirements isolate a sector of material-property space. If this sector contains materials, the requirements can be met by choosing one of them. But if the design requirements are sufficiently demanding, no single material may be found that can meet them all: The requirements lie in a hole in property space. Then the way forward is to identify and separate the conflicting requirements, seeking optimal material solutions for each, and then combine them in ways that retain the desirable attributes of both. The best choice is the one that ranks most highly when measured by the performance metrics that motivate the design: minimizing mass or cost or maximizing some aspect of performance (criterion of excellence). The alternative combinations are examined and assessed, using the criterion of excellence to rank them. The output is a specification of a hybrid in terms of its component materials and their configurations. The four classes of hybrid structures—composites, sandwiches, cellular, and segmented—are explored in the next four sections, applying the method.\n \n One material meets all\n \n Choice of congifuration Composite Sandwich Lattice Segment\n \n Analyze requirements Functions Constraints\n \n No material meets all separate functions\n \n Function 1 seek optimal solution Function 2 seek optimal solution\n \n Combine solutions and assess performance\n \n Interface engineering Welding Adhesives Fasteners\n \n FIGURE 11.5 The steps in designing a hybrid to meet given design requirements.\n \n Simple solution\n \n Hybrid solution\n \n 11.4 Composites\n \n 11.4 COMPOSITES Aircraft engineers, automobile makers, and designers of sports equipment all have one thing in common: They all want materials that are stiff, strong, tough, and light. The single-material choices that best achieve this are the light alloys: alloys that are based on magnesium, aluminum, and titanium. Much research aims at improving their properties. But they are not all that light— polymers have much lower densities. Nor are they all that stiff—ceramics are much stiffer and, particularly in the form of small particles or thin fibers, much stronger. These facts are exploited in the family of structural hybrids that we usually refer to as particulate and fibrous composites. Any two materials can, in principle, be combined to make a composite, and they can be mixed in FIGURE 11.6 many geometries (Figure 11.6). In this section we Schematic of hybrids of the composite type: unidirectional fibrous, laminated fiber, chopped fiber, and particulate restrict the discussion to fully dense, strongly bonded composites. Bounds and limits, described in the text, bracket composites such that there is no tendency for the the properties of all of these. components to separate at their interfaces when the composite is loaded, and to those in which the scale of the reinforcement is large compared to that of the atom or molecule size and the dislocation spacing, allowing the use of continuum methods. On a macroscopic scale—one that is large compared to that of the components —a composite behaves like a homogeneous solid with its own set of mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. Calculating these precisely can be done, but is difficult. It is much easier to bracket them by bounds or limits: upper and lower values between which the properties lie. The term “bound” will be used to describe a rigorous boundary, one that the value of the property cannot— subject to certain assumptions—exceed or fall below. It is not always possible to derive bounds; the best that can be done is to derive “limits” outside which it is unlikely that the value of the property lies. The important point is that the bounds orlimits bracket the properties of all the configurations of matrix and reinforcement shown in Figure 11.6; by using them we escape from the need to model individual geometries. Criteria of excellence We need criteria of excellence to assess any given hybrid’s merit. These are provided by the material indices of Chapter 5. If a possible hybrid has a value of any one of these that exceeds those of existing materials, it achieves our goal.\n \n 307\n \n 308\n \n CHAPTER 11:\n \n Designing Hybrid Materials\n \n Density When a volume fraction f of a reinforcement r (density ρ r ) is mixed with a volume fraction (1 − f ) of a matrix m (density ρm) to form a composite with no residual porosity, the composite density e ρ is given exactly by a rule of mixtures (an arithmetic mean weighted by volume fraction): e ρ = f ρr + ð1− f Þρm:\n \n (11.1)\n \n The geometry or shape of the reinforcement does not matter except in determining the maximum packing fraction of reinforcement and thus the upper limit for f. Modulus The modulus of a composite is bracketed by the well-known Voigt and Reuss bounds. The upper bound, e Eu , is obtained by postulating that, on loading, the two components suffer the same strain; the stress is then the volume average of the local stresses, and the composite modulus follows a rule of mixtures: e Eu = f Er + ð1− f ÞEm :\n \n (11.2a)\n \n Here Er is the Young’s modulus of the reinforcement and E m that of the matrix. The lower bound, e EL , is found by postulating instead that the two components carry the same stress; the strain is the volume average of the local strains, and the composite modulus is e EL =\n \n Em Er f Em + ð1− f ÞEr\n \n (11.2b)\n \n More precise bounds are possible, but the simple ones are adequate to illustrate the method. To see how the bounds are used, consider the following example.\n \n Composite design for stiffness at minimum mass A beam is at present made of an aluminum alloy. Beryllium is both lighter and less dense than aluminum; the ceramic alumina (Al2O3) is also stiffer but denser. Can hybrids of aluminum with either of these offer improved performance, measured by the criterion of excellence E 1/2 /ρ derived in Chapter 5? The three materials are plotted on a segment of the E − ρ property space in Figure 11.7. Composites made by mixing them have densities given exactly by Equation (11.1) and moduli that are bracketed by the bounds of Equations (11.2a) and (11.2b). Both of these moduli depend on the volume fraction of reinforcement and, through this, on the density. Upper and lower bounds for the modulus-density relationship can thus be plotted on the E − ρ chart using volume fraction f as a parameter, as shown in Figure 11.7. Any composite made by combining aluminum\n \n 11.4 Composites\n \n 1000 800\n \n Composite design\n \n Criterion of excellence E 1/2/ρ\n \n 10\n \n Stiffness/Density\n \n Young’s modulus E (GPa)\n \n 600 400\n \n Upper bound (fibers)\n \n Beryllium\n \n Alumina 0.8\n \n 200\n \n 0.6\n \n 10\n \n 100\n \n Volume fraction\n \n Lower bound (particles)\n \n 8\n \n 0.8 0.6\n \n 0.4\n \n 0.4\n \n 0.2\n \n 0.2\n \n Lower bound (particles)\n \n 7 6 5 40 1000\n \n 4\n \n 3\n \n Aluminum alloys 2\n \n 2000 3000 Density ρ (kg/m3)\n \n MFA, 09\n \n 4000\n \n 5000 6000\n \n FIGURE 11.7 Part of the E − ρ property chart, showing aluminum alloys, beryllium, and alumina (Al2O3). Bounds for the moduli of hybrids made by mixing them are shown. The diagonal contours plot the criterion of excellence E1/2/ρ. with alumina will have a modulus contained in the envelope for Al–Al2O3; the same for Al-Be. Fibrous reinforcement gives a modulus in a direction parallel to the fibers near the upper bound; particulate reinforcement or transversely loaded fibers give moduli near the lower one. The criterion of excellence, E1/2/ρ, is plotted as a grid in the Figure 11.7. The bound-envelope for Al–Be composites extends almost normal to the grid, while that for Al–Al 2 O 3 lies at a shallow angle to it. Beryllium fibers improve performance (as measured by E1/2/ρ) roughly four times as much as alumina fibers do, for the same volume fraction. The difference for particulate reinforcement is even more dramatic. The lower bound for Al-Be lies normal to the contours: 30% of particulate beryllium increases E1/2/ρ by a factor of 1.5. The lower bound for Al–Al2O3 is, initially, parallel to the E1/2/ρ grid: 30% of particulate Al2O3 gives almost no gain. The underlying reason is that both beryllium and Al2O3 increase the modulus, but only beryllium decreases the density; the criterion of excellence is more sensitive to density than to modulus. The commercial alloy AlBeMet (62% Be, 38% Al) exploits this idea. The two metals are mutually insoluble, creating a 2-phase composite of Al and Be with E1/2/ρ = 6.5 compared with 3.1 for Al alone.\n \n Strength Of all the bounds and limits described in this chapter, those for strength are the least satisfactory. The nonlinearity of the problem, the\n \n 309\n \n 310\n \n CHAPTER 11:\n \n Designing Hybrid Materials\n \n (b)\n \n FIGURE 11.8 Failure modes in composites.\n \n multitude of failure mechanisms 2 and the sensitivity of strength and toughness against impurities and processing defects makes accurate modeling difficult. The literature contains many calculations for special cases: reinforcement by unidirectional fibers or by a dilute dispersion of spheres. We wish to avoid models that require detailed knowledge of how a particular architecture behaves, and we seek less restrictive limits. As the load on a continuous fiber composite is increased, it is redistributed between the components until one suffers general yield or fracture (Figure 11.8(a)). Beyond this point the composite has suffered permanent deformation or damage but can still carry load; final failure requires yielding or fracture of both. The composite is strongest if both reach their failure state simultaneously. Thus the upper bound for a continuous fiber ply like that labeled “Unidirectional” in Figure 11.6 loaded parallel to the fibers (the axial strength in tension, subscript a) is a rule of mixtures: ðe σ f Þu,a = f ðσ f Þr + ð1 − f Þðσ f Þm\n \n (11.3a)\n \n 2 The treatment here is the simplest that allows the method to be demonstrated. The full complexity of the modeling of composite failure is documented in the texts in “Further reading.”\n \n 11.4 Composites\n \n where (σf)m is the strength of the matrix and (σf)r is that of the reinforcement. If one fails before the other, the load is carried by the survivor. Thus a lower bound for strength in tension is given by ðe σ f ÞL,a = Greater of ð f ðσ f Þr , ð1 − f Þðσ f Þm Þ\n \n (11.3b)\n \n Creating anisotropy The elastic and plastic properties of bulk monolithic solids are frequently anisotropic, but weakly so—the properties do not depend strongly on direction. Hybridization gives a way of creating controlled anisotropy, and it can be large. We have already seen an example in Figure 11.7, which shows the upper and lower bounds for the moduli of composites. The longitudinal properties of unidirectional long-fiber composites lie near the upper bound; the transverse properties, near the lower one. The vertical width of the band between them measures the anisotropy. A unidirectional continuous-fiber composite has a maximum anisotropy ratio Ra given by the ratio of the bounds—in this example   e E E E Ra = u = f 2 + ð1 − f Þ2 + f ð1 − f Þ m + r eL Er Em E In Figure 11.7 the maximum R a is only 1.5. A more dramatic example involving thermal properties is given in Chapter 12.\n \n Determining the transverse strength (Figure 11.8(b)) is more difficult. It depends on interface bond strength, fiber distribution, stress concentrations, and voids. In general the transverse strength is less than that of the unreinforced matrix, and the strain to failure, too, is less. In a continuous ductile matrix containing strongly bonded, nondeforming, particles or fibers, the flow in the matrix is constrained. The constraint increases the stress required for flow in the matrix, giving an upper-limiting tensile strength of 8   &lt; 1 ðe σ f Þu,t ≈ ðσ f Þm (11.4a) Lesser of 1 − f 1/2 : ðe σ f Þu,t ≈ ðσ f Þr More usually the transverse strength is lower than that of the matrix alone because of stress concentration and debonding at the fiber-matrix interface. Hull gives the approximate lower limit for tensile strength as \n \n  ðe σ f ÞL,t ≈ ðσ f Þm 1− f1/2\n \n (11.4b)\n \n The two pairs of limits allow the potential of a given choice of reinforcement and matrix to be explored. Figure 11.9 shows the limits for axial and transverse strength of an epoxy-glass composite ply.\n \n 311\n \n Designing Hybrid Materials\n \n Composite design 10,000 Axial strength (MPa)\n \n CHAPTER 11:\n \n 1000\n \n Axial strength\n \n E-glass fiber\n \n Upper limit fσf,r + (1− f )σf,m\n \n 100 Epoxy Lower limit\n \n 10\n \n (1− f )σf,m\n \n fσf,r 1 2000 Density ρ (kg/m3) (a)\n \n 1000\n \n 3000\n \n 4000\n \n Composite design 10,000 Transverse strength (MPa)\n \n 312\n \n Transverse strength\n \n E-glass fiber 1000 Upper limit ( plastic constraint) 100 Epoxy 10 Lower limit (stress concentration) 1 1000\n \n 2000 Density ρ (kg/m3) (b)\n \n 3000\n \n 4000\n \n FIGURE 11.9 The limits for axial (a) and transverse (b) strength of a composite ply.\n \n Continuous fiber composites can fail in compression by fiber kinking (Figure 11.8(a), extreme right). The kinking is resisted by the shear strength of the matrix, approximately (σf)m/2. This leads an axial compressive stress for buckling of fibers of ðe σ c Þu,a =\n \n 1 ðσ f Þm ≈ 14ðσ f Þm θ 2\n \n (11.5)\n \n Here θ is the initial misalignment of the fibers from the axis of compression, in radians. Experiments show that a typical value, in carefully aligned\n \n 11.4 Composites\n \n composites, is θ ≈ 0.035, giving the final value shown on the right of the equation. We identify the upper bound with the lesser of this and Equation (11.3a). When, instead, misalignment is severe, meaning θ ≈ 1, the strength falls greatly. We identify the lower bound for compressive failure with that of the matrix, (σf)m. Specific heat The specific heats of solids at constant pressure, C p , are almost the same as those at constant volume, Cv. If they were identical, the heat capacity per unit volume of a composite would, like the density, be given exactly by a rule-of-mixtures: e p = f ρr ðCp Þ + ð1− f Þρm ðCpÞm e ρC r\n \n (11.6)\n \n where (Cp)r is the specific heat of the reinforcement and (Cp)m is that of the matrix (the densities enter because the units of Cp are J/kg.K). A slight difference appears because thermal expansion generates a misfit between the components when the composite is heated; the misfit creates local pressures on the components and thus changes the specific heat. The effect is very small and need not concern us further. Thermal expansion coefficient The thermal expansion of a composite can, in some directions, be greater than that of either component; in others, less. This is because an elastic constant—Poisson’s ratio—couples the principal elastic strains; if the matrix is prevented from expanding in one direction (by embedded fibers, for instance), then it expands more in the transverse directions. For simplicity we shall use the approximate lower bound: e αL =\n \n Er αr f + Em αm ð1 − f Þ Er f + Em ð1 − f Þ\n \n (11.7)\n \n (it reduces to the rule of mixtures when the moduli are the same) and the upper bound: e αu = f αr ð1 + vr Þ + ð1 − f Þαm ð1 + vm Þ − αL 1⁄2 fvr + ð1− f Þvm \n \n (11.8)\n \n where αr and αm are the two expansion coefficients and vr and vm are the Poisson’s ratios. Thermal conductivity Thermal conductivity determines heat flow at a steady rate. A composite of two materials, bonded to give good thermal contact, has a thermal conductivity λ that lies between those of the individual components, λ m and λ r . Not surprisingly, a composite containing parallel continuous fibers has a conductivity, parallel to the fibers, given by a rule of mixtures: e λu = f λr + ð1 − f Þλm\n \n (11.9)\n \n This is an upper bound: In any other direction the conductivity is lower. The transverse conductivity of a parallel-fiber composite (again assuming good\n \n 313\n \n 314\n \n CHAPTER 11:\n \n Designing Hybrid Materials\n \n bonding and thermal contact) lies near the lower bound first derived by Maxwell:   λr + 2λm − 2f ðλm − λr Þ e λL = λm λr + 2λm + f ðλm − λr Þ\n \n (11.10)\n \n Particulate composites, too, have a conductivity near this lower bound. Poor interface conductivity can make λ drop below it. Debonding or an interfacial layer between reinforcement and matrix can cause this; so, too, can a large difference of modulus between reinforcement and matrix (because this reflects phonons, creating an interface impedance) or a structural scale that is shorter than the phonon wavelengths. Thermal diffusivity The thermal diffusivity a=\n \n λ ρCp\n \n determines heat flow when conditions are transient, that is, when the temperature field changes with time. It is formed from three of the earlier properties: λ, ρ, and Cp. The second and third of these are given exactly by Equations (11.1) and (11.6), allowing the diffusivity to be expressed as e a=\n \n e λ f ρr ðCp Þr + ð1 − f Þρm ðCp Þm\n \n (11.11)\n \n Its upper and lower bounds are found by substituting those for e λ (Equations (11.9) and (11.10)) into this equation.\n \n Composite design for controlled thermal response Thermo-mechanical design involves the specific heat,Cp, the thermal expansion, α, the conductivity, λ, and the diffusivity, a. These composite properties are bounded by Equations (11.6) through (11.11). They are involved in a number of indices. One is the criterion for minimizing thermal distortion derived in Section 6.16: maximizing the index λ/α. Figure 11.10 shows a small part of the α − λ materials selection chart, with a grid showing the criterion of excellence, λ/α, superimposed on it. Three materials are shown: aluminum, boron nitride (BN), and silicon carbide (SiC). The thermal properties of Al–BN and Al–SiC composites are bracketed by envelopes calculated from the bounding equations. (Both α and λ have upper and lower bounds so there are four possible combinations for each material pair. Those shown in the figure are the outermost pair of the four.) The plot reveals immediately that SiC reinforcement in aluminum increases performance (as measured by λ/α); reinforcement with BN decreases it.\n \n 11.4 Composites\n \n 100\n \n 106\n \n Linear expansion coefficient α (10 − 6/K)\n \n Composite design\n \n 3 × 106\n \n Conductivity/Expansion\n \n 107\n \n Criterion of excellence λ/α\n \n 50\n \n 1000 series aluminum alloys\n \n Bound α u, λ l\n \n 20\n \n Boron nitride\n \n 10\n \n 3 × 107 Bound α l, λ u\n \n Bound α l, λ u 108\n \n Bound α u, λ l\n \n 5\n \n Silicon carbide MFA, 09\n \n 2 10\n \n 30\n \n 70\n \n 100\n \n 300\n \n 700\n \n Thermal conductivity λ (W/m.K)\n \n FIGURE 11.10 A part of expansion-coefficient/conductivity space showing aluminum alloys, boron nitride, and silicon carbide.

Electrical conductivity and percolation When the electrical conductivities κ of the components of a composite are of comparable magnitude, bounds for the electrical conductivity are given by those for thermal conductivity with λ replaced by κ. When, instead, they differ by many orders of magnitude (a metallic powder dispersed in an insulating polymer, for instance), questions of percolation arise. Percolation is discussed in Section 12.3. Filling property space with composites We end this section with two figures illustrating how the development of composites has filled out the occupancy of material-property space. The first, Figure 11.11, is a modulusdensity (E − ρ) section. The areas filled by unreinforced metals and polymers appear as pale red and pale blue envelopes; members are labeled in gray (they are taken from the original E − ρ chart in Figure 4.3).

Both extend into areas that were previously empty. Using any one of the indices for light, stiff structures (E/ρ, E 1/2/ρ and E 1/3 /ρ) as a criterion of excellence, we find that composites offer performance that was not previously attainable. Figure 11.12 paints a similar picture for the strength-density (σy − ρ) section. The color coding is the same as that in Figure 11.11. Composites again expand the populated area in a direction that, using the indices for light strong 2/3 1/2 structures (σy/ρ, σ f /ρ, and σ f /ρ) as a criterion, offers enhanced performance.\n \n 11.5 SANDWICH STRUCTURES A sandwich panel epitomizes the concept of a hybrid.

The separation of the faces by the core increases the moment of inertia of the section, I, and its section modulus, Z, producing a structure that resists bending and buckling loads well. Sandwiches are used where weight saving is critical: in aircraft, trains, motor vehicles, portable structures, and sports equipment. Nature, too, makes use of sandwich designs: Sections through the human skull, the wing of a bird, and the stalk and leaves of many plants show a low-density foam-like core separating solid faces.3\n \n Faces: material A\n \n d\n \n t c\n \n Core: material B b\n \n t L\n \n FIGURE 11.13 The sandwich.

The core, of thickness c, occupies most of the volume; it must be light and stiff and strong enough to carry the shear stresses necessary to make the whole panel behave as a load-bearing unit, (if the core is much thicker than the faces, these stresses are small). A sandwich as a “material” So far we have spoken of the sandwich as a structure: faces of material A supported on a core of material B, each with its own density, modulus, and strength. But we can also think of it as a material with its own set of properties, and this is useful because it allows comparison with more conventional materials. To do this we calculate equivalent material properties for the sandwich, and we identify them, like composites, by a tilde (e.g., e ρ, e E). The quantities e ρ and e E can be plotted on the modulus-density chart, allowing a direct comparison with all the other materials on the chart. All the constructions using material indices apply unchanged. The symbols that appear in this section are defined in Table 11.2.\n \n Finding equivalent properties of structured materials by experiment Consider a sandwich structure with solid skins separated by a cellular core.

It has a flexural stiffness EI, measured by loading the panel in bending and recording the deflection.

The symbols are defined earlier in Table 11.2. Equivalent density The equivalent density of the sandwich (its mass divided by its volume) is e ρ = f ρf + ð1 − f Þρc\n \n (11.16)\n \n Here f is the volume fraction occupied by the faces: f = 2t/d. Mechanical properties Sandwich panels are designed to be stiff and strong during bending. In thinking of the panel as a “material,” we must therefore distinguish the in-plane modulus and strength from those in bending. The σ in-plane are given, to an adequate effective in-plane modulus e Ein-plane and strength e approximation, by the rule of mixtures. Equivalent flexural modulus Flexural properties are quite different. The flexural compliance (the reciprocal of the stiffness) has two contributions: one from the bending of the panel as a whole, the other from the shear of the core (Figure 11.14). They add.

Equivalent flexural strength Sandwich panels can fail in many different ways (Figure 11.15). The failure mechanisms compete, meaning that the one at the lowest load dominates.

In the first of these shows the equivalent density e ρ and equivalent flexural modulus, e E (Equations (11.16) and (11.18)) for sandwiches, using the data in Table 11.4. Here CFRP face sheets are combined with a high-performance foam core in different ratios, stepping through values of 2t/d for a chosen ratio of d/L to give the trajectory shown.

We take the equivalent failure strength σ flex2 , and e σ flex3 (Equations (11.19), (11.21), and to be the least of e σ flex1 , e (11.22)), thereby properly accounting for the competition between them. For the conditions chosen here, face buckling dominates for f &lt; 0.025; face yield dominates from f = 0.025 to f = 0.1, when a switch to core shear takes place.

Indentation is included by imposing a minimum on the thickness ratio 2t/d.\n \n Indentation was not included in this competition because it is a local mechanism—it depends on the area of contact (or of impact) with the indenter, often an event for which the panel was not primarily designed. Protection is possible by estimating a “worst case” for the indentation load and area and calculating the value t/d required to withstand it. This is done using Equation (11.23) to calculate a lower safe limit for t/d, which is then applied as a constraint to the trajectory.\n \n 325\n \n 326\n \n CHAPTER 11:\n \n Designing Hybrid Materials\n \n Thermal properties Thermal properties are treated in a similar way. The specific heat Cp follows a rule of mixtures (Equation (11.6)). The in-plane thermal conductivity λ// also follows such a rule (Equation (11.9)).

At short times heat does not penetrate the core and the diffusivity is that of the face, but at longer times the diffusivity tends to the ep. value given by the ratio eλ/e ρC Electrical properties The dielectric constant of a sandwich, as with composites, is given by a rule of mixtures—that is, Equation (11.12)—with f = 2t/d. Polymer foams have very low dielectric constants, so sandwiches with GFRP faces and polymer foam cores allow the construction of stiff, strong shells with exceptionally low dielectric loss. In-plane electrical conductivity, too, follows a rule of mixtures. Through-thickness electrical conductivity, like that of heat, is described by the harmonic mean—that is, the equivalent of Equation (11.24). Filling property space with sandwich structures We end this section, as we did the last, with two figures illustrating how sandwich structures can expand the occupancy of material-property space.

Figure 11.21 tells a similar story for the strength-density (σf − ρ) section. The color coding is the same as that in the previous figure. The strength-density trajectory from Figure 11.19 is overlaid. Sandwiches again expand the popu1/2 lated area in a direction that, using the index for a light, strong panel (σ f /ρ) as a criterion, offers enhanced performance.\n \n 327\n \n CHAPTER 11:\n \n Designing Hybrid Materials\n \n 1/2 Index σ ρ\n \n 10,000\n \n Ceramics\n \n Flexural strength – Density\n \n Composites\n \n Si3N4 Al alloys\n \n Al2O3\n \n SiC\n \n Ti alloys Steels\n \n Metals Ni alloys\n \n CFRP\n \n 1,000\n \n 100\n \n 0.1\n \n 0.5\n \n 0.9 0.7\n \n Copper alloys\n \n PET\n \n 0.03 0.02\n \n PP PE\n \n 0.01 0.005\n \n Rigid polymer foams\n \n 0.3\n \n 0.2\n \n 0.05\n \n 10\n \n Tungsten alloys Tungsten carbide\n \n CFRP–foam sandwiches Flexural strength E (MPa)\n \n 328\n \n Woods, ⊥\n \n Zinc alloys Lead alloys\n \n Polymers and elastomers\n \n Foams 1\n \n Concrete Butyl rubber\n \n Silicone elastomers\n \n Cork\n \n Natural materials\n \n 0.1\n \n σf ρ\n \n Flexible polymer foams\n \n 0.01 10\n \n 100\n \n 1000 Density ρ\n \n σ f2/3 ρ\n \n σ f1/2 ρ\n \n Guide lines for minimum mass design MFA, 09\n \n 10,000\n \n (kg/m3)\n \n FIGURE 11.21 The sandwich data of Figure 11.19 superimposed on a strength-density chart, showing the exceptional value of the flexural stiffness index σ1/2/ρ.\n \n 11.6 CELLULAR STRUCTURES: FOAMS AND LATTICES Cellular structures—foams and lattices—are hybrids of a solid and a gas. The properties of the gas might at first seem irrelevant, but this is not so. The thermal conductivity of low-density foams of the sort used for insulation is determined by the conductivity of the gas contained in its pores; and the dielectric constant and breakdown potential, and even the compressibility, can depend on the gas properties. There are two distinct species of cellular solid. The distinction is most obvious in their mechanical properties. The first, typified by foams, are bendingdominated structures; the second, typified by triangulated lattice structures, are stretch dominated—a distinction explained more fully next. To give an idea of\n \n 11.6 Cellular Structures: Foams and Lattices\n \n the difference: A foam with a relative density of 0.1 (meaning that the solid cell walls occupy 10% of the volume) is less stiff by a factor of 10 than a triangulated lattice of the same relative density. The word “configuration” has special relevance here. Foams: Bending-dominated structures Foams are cellular solids made by expanding polymers, metals, ceramics, or glasses with a foaming agent—a generic term for one of many ways of introducing gas, much as yeast does in breadmaking. Figure 11.22 shows an idealized cell of a low-density foam. It consists of solid cell walls or edges surrounding a void space containing a gas or fluid. Cellular solids are characterized by their relative density, which for the structure shown here (with t 0 and it behaves as an almost isotropic, stretch-dominated structure. On average one-third of its bars carry tension when the structure is loaded in simple tension.

Their mechanical response depends on their structure. Foams are usually bending-dominated and lie along a line of slope 2 on this chart. Micro-truss structures are stretch-dominated and lie on a line of slope 1. Both extend the occupied area of this chart by many decades.\n \n 335\n \n 336\n \n CHAPTER 11:\n \n Designing Hybrid Materials\n \n shows the modulus-density (E − ρ) section through material-property space. The polymer foam envelope is extended along a line of slope 2, as predicted by Equation (11.29). Lattice structures, by contrast, extend along a line of slope 1, as Equation (11.40) predicts. Both fill areas of E − ρ space that are not filled by solid materials. Lattice structures push the filled area to higher values of the indices E1/2 /ρ\n \n and\n \n E1/3 /ρ\n \n 11.7 SEGMENTED STRUCTURES Subdivision as a design variable Shape can be used to reduce flexural stiffness and strength as well as to increase them. Springs, suspensions, flexible cables, and other structures that must flex yet have high tensile strength use shape to give a low bending stiffness. This is achieved by shaping the material into strands or leaves, as explained in Section 10.7. The slender strands or leaves bend easily but do not stretch when the section is bent: an n-strand cable is less stiff by a factor of 3/πn than the solid reference section; an n-leaf panel by a factor 1/n2. Subdivision allows mixing. If one or more of the segments is replaced by a second material, combinations can be created that have property combinations not found in monolithic materials. The method is best illustrated by the example that follows. Subdivision can be used in another way: to impart damage tolerance. A glass window, hit by a projectile, will shatter. One made of small glass bricks, laid as bricks usually are, will lose a brick or two but not shatter totally; it is damagetolerant. By subdividing and separating the material, a crack in one segment does not penetrate into its neighbors, allowing local but not global failure. This is the principle of “topological toughening.” Builders in stone and brick have exploited the idea for thousands of years: Stone and brick are brittle, but buildings made of them—even those made without cement (“dry-stone building”)—survive ground movement, even small earthquakes, through their ability to deform with some local failure but without total collapse.\n \n Materials for long-span power cables In the design of suspended power cables, the objectives are to minimize electrical resistance and at the same time maximize the strength since this allows the greatest span. This is an example of multiobjective optimization, discussed in Chapter 7. As explained there, each objective is expressed, by convention, such that a minimum for it is sought. We thus seek materials with the lowest values of resistivity ρe and the reciprocal of yield strength, 1/σy.\n \n 11.7 Segmented Structures\n \n Figure 11.29 shows the result: Materials that best meet the design requirements lie toward the bottom left. But here there is a hole: All 1700 metals and alloys plotted here have properties that lie above the broken red line, none below. Those with the lowest resistance— copper, aluminum, and certain of their alloys—are not very strong; those that are strongest— drawn carbon and low-alloy steel—do not conduct very well. Now consider a cable made by interleaving strands of copper and steel such that each occupies half the cross-section. If the steel carries no current and the copper no load (the most pessimistic scenario), the performance of the cable will lie at the point shown on the figure—it has twice the resistivity of the copper and half the strength of the steel. It lies in a part of property space that was empty, offering performance not previously possible. Other ratios of copper to steel fill other parts of the space; by varying the ratio, the shaded envelope in the figure is covered. Similar hybrids of aluminum and steel fill a different area, as is easily seen by repeating the construction using “1000 series Al alloys” in place of “OFHC copper, hard” in the combination. Their combinations of ρe and σy are less good, but they are lighter and cheaper and for this reason are widely used.\n \n Factor 2\n \n 10−1\n \n Strength – Resistivity\n \n 1/Yield strength (1/MPa)\n \n Envelope of best solutions Pure aluminum Populated region\n \n 1000 series Al, hard drawn\n \n 10−2\n \n OFHC copper, soft OFHC copper, hard Copper-chromium alloys\n \n 10−3\n \n Factor 2\n \n Hybrid: 50% copper 50% steel\n \n High carbon steel HSLA steel Medium carbon steel\n \n 10−4 0.1\n \n 1\n \n 10 Electrical resistivity (μ Ω.cm)\n \n 100\n \n FIGURE 11.29 Designing a hybrid–here one with high strength and high electrical conductivity.

(a) Bricklike assemblies of rectangular blocks carry axial compression, but not tension or shear. (b) The 2-dimensional interlocking of a jigsaw puzzle carries in-plane loads. (c) Units that, when assembled into a continuous layer and clamped within a rigid boundary around the edges of the layer, can carry out-of-plane loads and bending moments.\n \n Taking the simplest view, two things are necessary in order to have topological damage tolerance: discreteness of the structural units and an interlocking of the units in such a way that the array as a whole can carry a load. Brick-like arrangements (Figure 11.30(a) carry large loads and are damage-tolerant in compression and shear, but disintegrate under tension. Strand- and layer-like structures are damage-tolerant in tension because if one strand fails, the crack does not penetrate its neighbors—the principle of multistrand ropes and cables. The jigsaw puzzle configuration (Figure 11.30(b)) carries in-plane tension, compression and shear, but at the cost of introducing a stress pffiffiffiffiffiffiffi concentration factor of about R/r , where R is the approximate radius of a unit and r that of the interlock.\n \n The sources listed in Section 11.9 explore a particular set of topologies that rely on compressive or rigid boundary conditions to create continuous layers that tolerate out-of-plane forces and bending moments, illustrated in Figure 11.30(c). This is done by creating interlocking units with nonplanar surfaces that have curvature both in the plane of the array and normal to it. Provided the array is constrained at its periphery, the nesting shapes limit the relative motion of the units, locking them together. Topological interlocking of this sort allows the formation of continuous layers that can be used for ceramic claddings or linings to give surface protection. And of course the units need not be made of one material alone. Since the only requirement is that of interlocking shape, the segments can be made of different materials. Just as a builder constructing a brick wall can use porous bricks for ventilation and transparent bricks to admit light, the designer of a segmented hybrid can add functionality through the choice of material for the units.\n \n 11.8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The properties of engineering materials can be thought of as defining the axes of a multidimensional space, with each property as a dimension. Chapter 4 showed how this space can be mapped. The maps reveal that some areas of\n \n 11.9 Further Reading\n \n property space are occupied and others are empty—there are holes. The holes can sometimes be filled by making hybrids: combinations of two (or more) materials in a chosen configuration and scale. Design requirements isolate a small box in a multidimensional material-property space. If it is occupied by materials, the requirements can be met. However, if the box hits a hole in any one of the dimensions, we need a hybrid. A number of families of configuration exist, each offering different combinations of functionality. Individual configurations are characterized by a set of bounds, bracketing their effective properties. The methods developed in this chapter provide tools for exploring alternative material configuration combinations. Chapter 12 gives examples of their use.\n \n 11.9 FURTHER READING Hybrid materials—general Bendsoe, M.P., &amp; Sigmund, O. (2003). Topology optimization, theory, methods, and applications.

Each is associated with a set of models that allow its properties to be estimated. In this chapter we illustrate the models’ use to design hybrids to fill specified needs—needs that cannot be filled by single material choices. The cover picture is a reminder of the widespread use of hybrids to maximize performance: The yacht is almost entirely made of hybrid materials.\n \n 12.2 DESIGNING METAL MATRIX COMPOSITES The most common state of loading in structures is that of bending. One measure of excellence in designing materials to carry bending moments at minimum weight is the index E1/2 /ρ, where E is Young’s modulus and is the ρ the density. Alloys of aluminum and of magnesium rank highly by this criterion; titanium alloys and steels are not as good. How could the performance of magnesium (the best of the lot) be enhanced further? Table 12.1 summarizes the challenge.\n \n Table 12.1 Design Requirements for the Material of the Panel Function Constraint Objective Free variable\n \n Light, stiff beam Magnesium matrix Maximize stiffness to weight in bending (index E 1/2 /ρ) Choice of reinforcement and volume fraction\n \n 12.2 Designing Metal Matrix Composites\n \n Modulus – Density\n \n Criterion of excellence E1/2/ρ\n \n 1000\n \n Young’s modulus E (GPa)\n \n Carbon fibers\n \n SiC fibers Al2O3 fibers\n \n Fibers\n \n Steels\n \n W alloys\n \n PE fibers\n \n 100 Cu alloys Ti alloys Al alloys\n \n Zn alloys\n \n Metals\n \n Mg alloys Pb alloys\n \n 10 500\n \n 1000\n \n 2000\n \n 5000\n \n 10,000\n \n 30,000\n \n Density ρ (kg/m3)\n \n FIGURE 12.1 Possible magnesium-matrix composites.

Magnesium alloys appear at the extreme left of the red “Metals” envelope. The criterion of excellence is shown as a set of diagonal contours, increasing toward the top left. Magnesium ranks slightly higher than aluminum and much higher than titanium and steel. Table 12.2 summarizes the superposition rules for density and modulus. They are plotted as envelopes of attainable performance for four magnesium-based composites; the upper edge of each envelope is the upper bound; the lower edge, the lower bound. There is an upper limit for the volume fraction, which\n \n 343\n \n 344\n \n CHAPTER 12:\n \n Case Studies: Hybrids\n \n we will set at 0.5. It is shown as a vertical bar within each envelope. Only the shaded part of the envelope below the bar is accessible. The diagonal lines plot the criterion of excellence, E1/2 /ρ. The combinations with the highest values of this quantity offer the greatest gain in stiffness per unit weight. The results It is immediately apparent that the greatest promise is shown by the composites of magnesium with drawn polyethylene (PE) or carbon fibers; magnesium-SiC is less good. Magnesium-Al2O3 offers almost no gain at all. The method allows the potential of rapidly exploring alternative choices. Postscript Magnesium-PE composites look good and are promising, but there remains the challenge of actually making them. Polyethylene fibers are already used in ropes and cables because of their high stiffness, strength, and low weight. But they are destroyed by temperatures much above 120°C, so casting or sintering of the magnesium around the fibers is not an option. One possibility is to use drawn PE sheets rather than fibers, and fabricate a multilayer laminate by bonding the PE sheets between sheets of magnesium. A second possibility is to explore ternary composites: dispersing magnesium powder in an epoxy and using this mix as the matrix to contain the PE fibers, for example. Otherwise we must fall back on magnesium-carbon, an attractive option. Related case study 6.12 “Stiff, high damping materials for shaker tables”\n \n 12.3 FLEXIBLE CONDUCTORS AND PERCOLATION A material is required for demountable seals in specialized equipment. The material must conform to the curved surfaces between which it is clamped, it must be electrically conducting to prevent charge build-up, and it should be moldable. Table 12.3 summarizes the requirements. The method and results Metals, carbon, and some carbides and intermetallics are good conductors, but they are stiff and cannot be molded (Figure 12.2). Thermoplastic and thermosetting elastomers can be molded and are flexible, but they do not conduct. How are they to be combined? Metal coating of polymers is workable if the product will be used in a protected environment, but coatings are easily damaged.

This can be achieved by dispersing conducting material in a polymer. But how much? And in what shape? Think of mixing conducting and insulating spheres of the same size by shaking them up in a jar. If there are only a few conducting spheres, they do not touch and the array as a whole is an insulator. If each conducting sphere contacts just one other, there is still no connecting path. If, on average, each touches two, there is still no path. Adding more conducting spheres gives larger clusters, but they can be large yet still discrete. For bulk conduction we need connectivity: The array first becomes a conductor when a single trail of contacts links one surface to the other, that is, when the volume fraction f of the conducting spheres reaches the percolation threshold fc. Percolation problems are easy to describe but difficult to solve. Research since 1960 has provided\n \n 345\n \n 346\n \n CHAPTER 12:\n \n Case Studies: Hybrids\n \n approximate solutions to most of the percolation problems associated with the design of hybrids (see “Further reading” for a review). For simple cubic packing fc = 0.248; for close packing fc = 0.180. For a random array (the sphere shaken in a jar) it is somewhere in between—approximately 0.2.1 Making the spheres smaller smears the transition out. The percolation threshold is still 0.2, but the first connecting path is now thin and extremely devious—it is the only one out of the vast number of almost complete paths that actually connects. Increase the volume fraction and the number of conducting paths increases initially as (f − fc)2, then linearly, reverting to a rule of mixtures. If the particles are very small, as much as 40% may be needed to give good conduction. But a loading of 40% seriously degrades the moldability and flexibility of the polymer. Shape gives a way out. If the spheres are replaced by slender fibers, they touch more easily and the percolation threshold falls. If their aspect ratio is β = L/d (where L is the fiber length, d the diameter), then, empirically, the percolation threshold falls from fc to roughly fc /β1/2 , so an aspect ratio of 9 reduces pc, the volume fraction of the conducting phase, by a factor of 3. The concept of percolation is a necessary tool in designing hybrids. Electrical conductivity works that way; so too does the passage of liquids through foams or porous media—no connected path and no fluid flows; just one (out of a million possibilities) and there is a leak. Add a few more connections and there is a flood. Percolation ideas are particularly important in understanding the transport properties of hybrids: Properties that determine the flow of electricity or heat, of fluid, or of flow by diffusion, especially when the differences in properties of the components are extreme, because it is then that connected paths matter. Figure 12.2 is a chart of electrical resistivity and modulus with metals, polymers, and composites plotted. There is a hole at the lower left where materials with the property combination we want would lie. The pale-green L-shaped envelope encloses the properties of hybrids of rubber with chopped copper wires. The resistivity drops sharply at the percolation threshold, which, for wires, falls to a few percent. The material retains all the flexibility of the elastomer but behaves as a bulk conductor. Postscript Conducting elastomers exploiting these ideas are widely available. Such materials find application in antistatic clothing and mats, as pressure sensing elements, and even as solderless connections. Related case study 12.4 “Extreme combinations of thermal and electrical conduction” 1 These results are for infinite, or at least very large, arrays. Experiments generally give values in the range 0.19 to 0.22, with some variability because of the finite size of the samples.\n \n 12.4 Extreme Combinations of Thermal and Electrical Conduction\n \n 12.4 EXTREME COMBINATIONS OF THERMAL AND ELECTRICAL CONDUCTION Materials that are good electrical conductors are always good thermal conductors too. Copper, for example, excels at both. Most polymers, by contrast, are electrical insulators (meaning that their conductivity is so low that for practical purposes they do not conduct at all), and as solids go they are also poor thermal conductors—polyethylene is an example. Thus the “highhigh” and “low-low” combinations of conduction can be met by monolithic materials, and there are plenty of them. The “high-low” and “low-high” combinations are a different matter: Nature gives us very few of either. The challenge is summarized in Table 12.4: Using only copper and polyethylene, devise hybrid materials that achieve both of these combinations (data for both are in Table 12.5). The method and results Figure 12.3 shows two possible hybrid configurations. Both are of type “composite” but with very different configurations and volume fractions. The first is a tangle of fine copper wires embedded in a PE matrix. To describe its performance we draw on the bounds of Section 11.4. Electrical conductivity requires percolation; as explained in Section 12.3, the percolation threshold is minimized by using conducting wires of high aspect ratio. Above the percolation threshold the conductivity tends toward a rule of mixtures (Equation (11.9), with thermal conductivity replaced by electrical conductivity): e κ1 = f κ cu + ð1 − f Þ κPE\n \n (12.1)\n \n Table 12.4 Requirements for the Conducting Hybrids of Copper and Polyethylene Function Constraint Objective Configuration Free variable\n \n Extreme conduction combinations Materials: copper and polyethylene Maximize difference between electrical and thermal conductivities Free choice Configuration and relative volume fractions of the two materials\n \n Table 12.5 Data for Copper and HDPE Material High conductivity copper High density polyethylene\n \n Electrical Conductivity (1/μΩ.cm) 0.6 1 × 10−25\n \n Thermal Conductivity (W/m.K) 395 0.16\n \n 347\n \n 348\n \n CHAPTER 12:\n \n Case Studies: Hybrids\n \n Copper\n \n Volume fraction of Thickness of PE = c copper fibers = f Polyethylene Thickness of Cu = 2t\n \n FIGURE 12.3 Two alternative configurations of copper and polyethylene, shown here in two dimensions but easily generalized to three.

The second hybrid is a multilayered composite with three orthogonal families of PE sheet separating blocks of copper. We draw again on the bounds of Section 11.4. When the PE layers are thin, the through-thickness thermal resistances add; the same is true of the electrical resistances. This means that both the electrical and thermal conductivities are given by the harmonic means (Equation (11.24)):  e κ2 = e λ2 =\n \n f κCu\n \n \n \n f\n \n λCu\n \n ð1−f Þ + κ PE +\n \n −1\n \n ð1− f Þ λPE\n \n (12.3) −1 (12.4)\n \n The composite properties e κ2 and e λ2 are also plotted in Figure 12.4, giving the lower curve. The shape of the curve is a consequence of the very different ranges of values of the two properties: a factor of 1000 for λ, a factor of 1025 for κ. The two hybrids differ dramatically in their behavior. The hybridization has allowed the creation of “materials” with extreme combinations of conductivities.

How would you make the second type of hybrid? Perhaps by thermally bonding a stack of copper sheets interleaved with polyethylene film, dicing the stack normal to the layers and restacking the slices with PE film interlayers, and finally dicing and restacking a third time to give the last set of layers.

The quantity e Eflex for the sandwich is given by Equation (11.18) and its through-thickness thermal conductivity is given by Equation (11.24). Simplified equations describing them are assembled in Table 12.7, in which t is the face sheet thickness, d the panel thickness, E f the modulus of the face material, λ f and λ c the conductivities of face and core, and Ks the knock-down factor to allow for core shear, ideally equal to 1 (no shear) but potentially as low as 0.5.\n \n 12.5 Refrigerator Walls\n \n 103 Trade-off surface\n \n Metals\n \n Faces: material A\n \n t ∼ Thermal conductivity λ (W/m.K)\n \n 10\n \n d Core: material B\n \n 2\n \n t\n \n 1020 cold rolled steel\n \n Metal foams\n \n 10 Composites 1 Steel – PVC sandwiches 10−1\n \n Polymers\n \n Polymer foams\n \n 2t/d = 0.5 0.2 0.1\n \n 10−2\n \n 10−4\n \n 10−3\n \n 10−2\n \n 0.05\n \n Rigid PVC foam\n \n 10−1\n \n 1 10 ∼ Flexural compliance 1/Eflex (GPa−1)\n \n 102\n \n 103\n \n FIGURE 12.6 The blue L-shaped trajectory plots the performance of steel-faced, PVC foam cored sandwiches.

The approximate performance of a sandwich with mild steel faces and a core of rigid foamed PVC is plotted using the equations in the table for four values of skin-to-core thickness; all other values are contained in the blue band. The panel offers combinations of stiffness and insulation that cannot be matched by monolithic metals, composites, polymers, or foams. Other combinations of face and core (aluminum or SMC faces with foamed polystyrene core, for example) can be evaluated efficiently using the same chart. Neither combination performs as well as the steel-polystyrene combination, though both come close. Postscript Adhesive technology has advanced rapidly over the last two decades. Adhesives are now available to bond almost any two materials, and to do so with high bond strength (though some adhesives are expensive). Fabricating the sandwich should not be a problem.

The radome is a thin panel or shell, requiring flexural stiffness and strength but also requiring as low a dielectric constant, εr, as possible. Could hybrids offer better performance than monolithic materials? The method and results Sandwich structures offer flexural stiffness and strength, and allow some control of electrical properties. We therefore explore these, seeking to meet the requirements of Table 12.8. Figure 12.7 shows the flexural strength, σ flex , of foams, polymers, and ceramics, plotted against the dielectric constant, εr. Many polymers have dielectric constants between 2 and 5. Dielectric response is an extensive property—if these polymers are foamed, the dielectric constant of the foam falls linearly with the relative density, approaching 1 at low densities (Equation (11.37)): eεr = 1 + ðεr,s −1Þ\n \n   e ρ ρs\n \n (12.5)\n \n where εr,s is the dielectric constant of the solid of which the foam is made and e ρ/ρs is its relative density. Foams, however, are not very strong. GFRP, with a dielectric constant of 5, is much stronger. Based on a survey of possible faces and cores from among those plotted in Figure 12.7, we choose to explore a sandwich with faces of GFRP and a core of a low-/medium-density expanded polymer foam. The flexural strength of the sandwich, provided it is properly manufactured and the core material has sufficient strength, is (Equation (11.19)) ðe σ flex ÞU = ð1 − ð1−f Þ2 Þ σ f + ð1−f Þ2 σ c\n \n (12.6)\n \n The dielectric constant for the panel (Equation (11.12) with f = 2t/d) is eεr = f εf + ð1 − f Þεc\n \n (12.7)\n \n Table 12.8 Requirements for Low Dielectric Constant Radome Skin Function Constraint Objective Free variables\n \n Material for protection of microwave detector Must meet constraints on flexural strength σflex Minimize dielectric constant εr Choice of material for face and core Relative thickness of the two materials\n \n 12.6 Materials for Microwave-Transparent Enclosures\n \n 1000\n \n Silicon carbide\n \n Dielectric constant – Strength\n \n Silicon nitride\n \n GFRP\n \n Alumina\n \n Silica glass\n \n Sandwiches\n \n Flexural strength σ flex (MPa)\n \n 100\n \n Silicon\n \n 2t/d = 0.5\n \n 0.2\n \n Al nitride 0.1\n \n Ceramics PP\n \n 0.05\n \n PS\n \n PE ABS\n \n 10\n \n Soda lime glass Phenolics\n \n PTFE Ionomer\n \n Polyesters\n \n Epoxies\n \n Polymers\n \n High-density rigid foam\n \n Rigid polymer foams\n \n 1\n \n Faces: GFRP\n \n t Medium-density rigid foam\n \n d\n \n c Core: low-density PS foam t\n \n Low-density rigid foam\n \n 0.1 1\n \n 2\n \n 5 Dielectric constant ε r\n \n 10\n \n FIGURE 12.7 A plot of flexural modulus and dielectric constant for low dielectric constant materials.

Figure 12.7 shows the results. The sandwich allows the creation of a set of materials with combinations of flexural strength and dielectric constant that outperform all the homogeneous materials that appear in the figure—indeed it outperforms even the best composites (not shown here). The figure works by identifying the desired flexural strength, σflex, and reading off the values of 2t/d and dielectric constant. Related reading Huddleston, G.K., &amp; Bassett, H.L. (1984).

The transition to drive-by-wire control systems will increase this further. Wires have ends; they don’t do much unless the ends are connected to something. The connectors are the problem: They loosen with time until, eventually, the connection is lost. Car makers, responding to market forces, now design cars to run for at least 300,000 kilometers and last, on average, 10 years. The electrical system is expected to operate without servicing for the lifetime of the car. Its integrity is vital: You would not be happy in a drive-by-wire car with loose connectors. With increasing instrumentation on engine and exhaust systems, many of the connectors get hot; some have to maintain good electrical contact at temperatures up to 200°C (see Table 12.9). The primary material choice for connectors today is a copper-beryllium alloy, Cu 2% Be: It has excellent conductivity and the high strength needed to act as a spring to give the required clamping force at the connection. But the maximum long-term service temperature of copper-beryllium alloys is only about 130°C; at higher temperatures, creep relaxation causes the connector to loosen its grip. The challenge: to suggest a way to solve this problem. The method and results The answer is to separate the functions, select the best material for each, check for compatibility, and combine the materials to make a hybrid. So here goes. Function 1: Conduct electricity. Copper excels at this; no other affordable material is as good. Its alloys (among them copper-beryllium) are stronger, but at the cost of some loss of conductivity and a great increase in price. We choose copper to provide the conduction. Function 2: Provide clamping force for the lifetime of the vehicle. The material chosen to fill function 2 will have to be bonded to the copper, and if the combination is not to distort when heated, it must have the same expansion coefficient. Figures 12.8 and 12.9 guide the choice. The first shows the maximum service temperature and expansion coefficient for copper, Cu-2% Be, and a range of steels. The box encloses materials with the same expansion coefficient as copper. Type 302 and 304 austenitic stainless steels match copper in expansion coefficient and can be used at much higher temperatures.

Type 302 or 304 stainless steel is a good choice for Material 2.\n \n make good springs? And are they affordable? Figure 12.9 answers these questions. Good materials for springs (Section 6.7) are those with high values of σ 2f /E—this appears as one axis of the chart. The other axis is approximate price/kg. The chart shows that both 302 and 304 stainless steels, in the wrought condition, are almost as good as Cu 2% Be as a spring and considerably cheaper. Postscript The proposed solution, then, is a hybrid of copper and type 302 stainless steel, roll-bonded to form a bilayer like that shown in the inset on both figures. Further detailed design will, of course, be needed to establish the thicknesses of each layer, the best degree of cold work, the formability, and the resistance to the environment in which it will be used. But the method has guided us to a sensible concept, quickly and efficiently.

That is because the saucepan is thin; heat is transmitted through the thickness more quickly than it can be spread transversely to bring the entire pan surface to a uniform temperature. The metals of which saucepans are usually made—cast iron, aluminum, stainless steel, or copper—have thermal conductivities that are isotropic, the same in all directions. What we clearly want is a thermal conductivity that is higher in the transverse direction than in the throughthickness direction. A bilayer (or multilayer) hybrid can achieve this. Table 12.10 summarizes the situation. The method and results Heat transmitted in the plane of a bilayer (Figure 12.10, inset) has two parallel paths; the total heat flux is a sum of\n \n 12.8 Exploiting Anisotropy: Heat-spreading Surfaces\n \n Table 12.10 Design Requirements for the Panel Function Constraint Objective Free variable\n \n Heat-spreading surface Temperature up to 200°C without distortion Maximize thermal anisotropy while maintaining good conduction Choice of materials and their relative thicknesses\n \n Thermal conductivity λ (W/m.K)\n \n 1000\n \n λ⊥\n \n Thermal conductivity λ ||\n \n S-steel\n \n 300\n \n 100\n \n OFHC Copper\n \n Copper\n \n Anistropy ratio = 6.7\n \n Transverse conductivity λ ||\n \n Through-thickness conductivity λ⊥\n \n 30 Type 302 stainless steel\n \n 10\n \n MFA, 09\n \n 0\n \n 0.5 1.0 Fraction, f, of copper\n \n FIGURE 12.10 Creating anisotropy.

The results Copper is an excellent thermal conductor. We saw, in Case Study 12.7, that the thermal expansion of copper matches that of 302 or 304 stainless steel.

By efficient we mean that they fulfill the complex requirements posed by the way plants and animals function and that they do so using as little material as possible. Many of these requirements are mechanical in nature: the need to support static and dynamic loads created by the mass of the organism or by wind loading, the need to store and release elastic energy, the need to flex through large angles, and the need to resist buckling and fracture. Virtually all natural materials are hybrids. They consist of a relatively small number of polymeric and ceramic components or building blocks that are often composites themselves. Plant cell walls, for instance, combine cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, and can be lignified; animal tissue consists largely of collagen, elastin, keratin, chitin, and minerals such as salts of calcium or silica. From these limited “ingredients” nature fabricates a remarkable range of structured hybrids. Wood, bamboo, and palm consist of cellulose fibers in a lignin/hemicellulose matrix, shaped to hollow prismatic cells of varying wall thickness. Hair, nail, horn, wool, reptilian scales, and hooves are made\n \n 12.9 The Mechanical Efficiency of Natural Materials\n \n of keratin while insect cuticle contains chitin in a matrix of protein. The dominant ingredient of mollusk shell is calcium carbonate, bonded with a few percent of protein. Dentine, bone, and antler are formed of “bricks” of hydroxyapatite cemented together with collagen. Collagen is the basic structural element for soft and hard tissues in animals, such as tendon, ligament, skin, blood vessels, muscle, and cartilage, often used in ways that exploit shape. From a mechanical point of view, there is nothing very special about the individual building blocks. Cellulose fibers have Young’s moduli that are about the same as those of nylon fishing line, but a lot less than those of steel; and the lignin-hemicellulose matrix in which they are embedded has properties very similar to those of epoxy. Hydroxyapatite has a fracture toughness comparable with that of human-made ceramics; that is to say it is brittle. It is thus the configuration of the components that give rise to the striking efficiency of natural materials. The complex hierarchies of configurations that make up wood and bone are illustrated in Figures 12.11 and 12.12. The stiffness, strength, and toughness of wood derive largely from the stiffness, strength, and toughness of the cellulose molecule, shown on the left of Figure 12.11. Crystalline microfibrils are built up of aligned molecules some 30 to 60 nm in length. These form the reinforcing fibers of the lamellae, the matrix of which is amorphous lignin and hemicellulose. Stacks of lamellae in the four-layer pattern and fiber orientation (right) become the structural material of the cell wall. The fibrils of the primary cell wall interweave randomly, as in cotton wool.

The outer S1 layer has lamellae with alternate right- and left-handed spiral winding of fibrils. Beneath it, the thicker S 2 layer has fibrils that are more nearly oriented along the axis of the cell. The innermost S3 layer has a lay-up like that of S 1 . The cell as a whole is bonded to its neighbors by the middle lamella (not shown), a lignin-pectin complex devoid of cellulose. There is an interesting parallel between the hierarchical structure of bone and that of wood, despite the great differences in their molecular chemistry (Figure 12.12). The starting point here is the triple-helical structure of the collagen molecule, shown on the left. But—unlike wood—this becomes the matrix, not the reinforcement of the mineralized tissue of bone. Hydroxyapatite nanoplatelets deposit in the nascent tissue and increase in volume fraction over time to produce the mature osteons, with an ordered lay-up of highly mineralized fibers with the strength and stiffness to support structural loads that bone must carry in a mature organism. At the most macro scale, nearly fully dense compact bone provides the outer structure of whole bone while highly porous trabecular bone fills the vertebrae, shell-like bones such as the skull, and the ends of the long bones such as the femur. The same as with engineering materials, the building blocks of natural materials can be grouped into classes: bio-ceramics (calcite, aragonite, hydroxyapatite), biopolymers (the organic building blocks: polysaccharides; cellulose;\n \n 12.9 The Mechanical Efficiency of Natural Materials\n \n and the proteins chitin, collagen, silk, and keratin), and natural elastomers (elastin, resilin, abductin, skin, artery, and cartilage). These combine to give a range of hybrids, among them composites and sandwiches (bone, antler, enamel, dentine, shell, cuttle, and coral), cellular structures (natural cellular materials such as wood, cork, palm, bamboo, trabecular bone), and segmented structures (scales, hair). Their properties, like those of engineering materials, can be explored and compared using material property charts. We conclude this chapter by examining charts for natural hybrids and the building blocks from which they are made.

Natural fibers (silk, flax, jute, and the like) have their own envelope, as does mineralized tissue (bone, shell, etc.) and soft tissue (ligament, cartilage, and so forth). Where they differ, the moduli parallel (symbol ||) and perpendicular (symbol ⊥) to the fiber orientation or grain have been plotted separately. Trabecular bone exhibits a particularly wide range of densities; for these, three bubbles for high density (HD), medium density (MD), and low density (LD) are plotted. The familiar stiffness guidelines E/ρ, E/p1/2/ρ, and E1/3/ρ are shown, each representing the material index for a particular mode of loading. The natural polymer with the highest efficiency in tension, measured by the index E/ρ, is cellulose; it exceeds that of steel by a factor of about 2.6. The high values for the fibers flax, hemp, and cotton derive from this. Wood, palm, and bamboo are particularly efficient in bending and resistant to buckling, as indicated by the high values of the flexure index E 1/2/ρ when loaded parallel to the grain. That for balsa wood, for example, can be five times greater than that for steel. The tensile strength–density chart Figure 12.14 shows data for the strength, σf, and density, ρ, of natural materials. The color coding and envelope scheme parallels that of Figure 12.13. For natural ceramics the tensile strength is identified with the flexural strength (modulus of rupture) in the beam-bending symbol (T). For natural polymers and elastomers, the strengths are tensile strengths. And for natural cellular materials, the tensile stress is either the plateau stress, or flexural strength, symbol (T), depending on the nature of the material. Where they differ, the strengths parallel (symbol ||) and perpendicular (symbol ⊥) to the fiber orientation or grain have been plotted separately. Evolution to provide tensile strength would—we anticipate—lead to materials with high values of σf/ρ, where strength in bending or buckling is required 2/3 we expect to find materials with high σ f /ρ. Silk and cellulose have the highest values of σf/ρ; that of silk is even higher than that of carbon fibers. The fibers of flax, hemp, and cotton, too, have high values of this index. 2/3 Bamboo, palm, and wood have high values of σ f /ρ, giving resistance to flexural failure. The Young’s modulus–strength chart Data for the strength, σ f , and modulus, E, of natural materials are shown in Figure 12.15. Two of the combinations are significant. Materials with large values of σ 2f /E store elastic energy and make good springs; those with large values of σf/E have exceptional resilience. Both are plotted in the figure. Silks (including the silks of spider webs) stand out as exceptionally efficient, having values of σ 2f /E that exceed those of spring steel or rubber. High values of the other index, σf/E,\n \n 12.9 The Mechanical Efficiency of Natural Materials\n \n 10000\n \n Strength – Density\n \n Natural\n \n 1000\n \n Srength σ (MPa)\n \n σf ρ σ f2/3 ρ\n \n 100\n \n σ f1/2 ρ\n \n Natural cellular materials 10\n \n Woods Socratea, Euterpe palm Balsa ll\n \n Palms (broken lines)\n \n Spider fibers drag-line silk Jute Cellulose Sisal Hemp Silkworm silk Spider viscid silk Cotton Organic building Wool Human hair blocks Coir Keratin Cortical bone (L) Lignum vitae ll Welfia palm Chitin Hydroxyapatite Maple ll Oak ll Bamboo ll Aragonite Elm ll Calcite Spruce ll Bioceramics Pine ll Mollusk Willow ll Dentine Egg shell Lignin L Bio-silica Collagen Cortical bone (T) Ash ll Ligament Acropora palmata Trabecular Coral Mineralized Siderastrea bone (HD) tissue Enamel radians Trabecular Montastrea annularis bone (MD) Lignum vitae ⊥ Trabecular Human skin bone (LD) Cartilage Oak ⊥ Elm ⊥ Pine ⊥ Spruce ⊥ Willow ⊥ Potato\n \n Iriartea palm\n \n 1\n \n Balsa ⊥\n \n Corks\n \n Trabecular bone (dash-dot lines)\n \n Parenchyma Tomato\n \n 100\n \n Resilin Abductin Artery and vein\n \n Soft tissue\n \n Apple\n \n 0.1 30\n \n Elastin\n \n 300\n \n 1000 Density ρ (kg/m3)\n \n Muscle\n \n MFA, 10\n \n 3000\n \n 10,000\n \n FIGURE 12.14 A material-property chart for natural materials, plotting strength against density.

The limited data for the toughness, Jc, and Young’s modulus, E, of natural materials are shown in Figure 12.16.

Many engineering materials (e.g., steels, aluminum, alloys) have values of Jc and K1c that are much higher than those of the best natural materials. However, the toughness of natural ceramics like nacre, dentine, cortical (dense) bone, and enamel is an order of magnitude higher than that of conventional engineering ceramics like alumina. Their toughness derives from their segmented structure: platelets of ceramics such as calcite, hydroxyapatite or aragonite, bonded by a small volume fraction of polymer, usually collagen; it increases with decreasing mineral content and increasing collagen content.\n \n 12.10 Further Reading: Natural Materials\n \n 100\n \n Toughness – Modulus\n \n Palms (broken lines)\n \n Soft tissue Keratin\n \n Hoof\n \n Horn Antler\n \n Lignum vitae ll Woods Oak ll\n \n (fibrous mode) 100\n \n 10\n \n Corks Trabecular bone (MD)\n \n Toughness (kJ/m2 )\n \n 1\n \n Elm ll Pine ll Trabecular Nut and bone (HD) seed\n \n Cortical bone (L) Bamboo ll Cortical bone (T) Mollusk\n \n Pine Spruce ll Dentine\n \n Willow Trabecular bone (LD)\n \n 0.1\n \n Willow ll Lignum vitae ⊥ Oak ⊥ Balsa ll Elm ⊥ Potato\n \n Trabecular bone (dash-dot lines)\n \n 0.01\n \n Natural cellular materials\n \n Enamel 10\n \n Bio-silica\n \n Hydroxyapatite\n \n Apple\n \n Balsa ⊥\n \n 3\n \n Spruce ⊥ Parenchyma Egg shell\n \n Woods (splitting mode)\n \n 30\n \n Dense mineralized tissue\n \n Calcite\n \n Aragonite\n \n Coral\n \n 0.001\n \n 1\n \n Bioceramics Fracture toughness (MPa.m1/2)\n \n 0.0001 0.001\n \n 0.01\n \n 0.1\n \n = 0.01\n \n 0.03\n \n 1 Young’s modulus E (GPa)\n \n 10\n \n 0.1\n \n 100\n \n 0.3 MFA, 10\n \n 1000\n \n FIGURE 12.16 A material-property chart for natural materials, plotting toughness against Young’s modulus.

Sand casting, injection molding, fusion welding, and electro-polishing are all processes; there are hundreds of them. The choice, for a given component, depends on the material of which it is to be made; on its size, shape, and required precision; and on how many are to be made—in short, on the design requirements. To select processes we must first classify them. Section 13.2 develops the classification. It is used to structure Section 13.3, in which process families and their attributes are described: the materials they can handle, the shapes they can make, and the precision with which they can do it. Processing has dual functions. The obvious one is that of shaping, joining, and finishing. The less obvious one is that of property control. Metals are strengthened by rolling and forging; steels are heat-treated to enhance hardness and toughness; polymers are drawn to increase modulus and strength; and ceramics are hot-pressed, again to increase strength. Processproperty relationships are explored more closely in Section 13.4. Process selection—finding the best match between process attributes and design requirements—is the subject of Sections 13.5 and 13.6. In using the methods developed there, one should not forget that material, shape and processing interact (Figure 13.1). Material properties and shape limit the choice of\n \n Function Translation, giving Constraints Objectives for selection\n \n Shape\n \n Material\n \n Shape factors\n \n Material families classes, members\n \n Indices that include shape\n \n Material attributes and documentation\n \n Coselection of material + shape\n \n Process Shaping Joining Surface treatment\n \n FIGURE 13.1 Processing selection depends on material and shape. The “process attributes” are used as criteria for selection.\n \n 13.2 Classifying Processes\n \n process: Ductile materials can be forged, rolled, and drawn; those that are brittle may have to be shaped using powder methods. Materials that melt at modest temperatures to low-viscosity liquids can be cast; those that do not have to be processed by other routes. Shape, too, can influence the choice of process. Slender shapes can be made easily by rolling or drawing but not by casting. Hollow shapes cannot be made by forging, but they can by casting or molding. Conversely, processing affects properties. Rolling and forging change the hardness and texture of metals and align the inclusions they contain, enhancing strength and ductility. Heat treatment allows manipulation of strength, ductility, and toughness. Composites do not exist until they are processed; before processing, they are just a soup of polymer and a sheaf of fibers. Like the other aspects of design, process selection is an iterative procedure. The first iteration gives one or more possible process routes. The design must then be rethought to adapt it, as far as possible, to ease manufacture by the most promising route. The final choice is based on a comparison of process cost, requiring the use of cost models developed in Section 13.6, and on documentation: guidelines, case histories, and examples of process routes used for related products. Documentation also helps in dealing with the coupling between process and material properties. The chapter ends, as always, with a summary and annotated recommendations for further reading.\n \n 13.2 CLASSIFYING PROCESSES Manufacturing processes can be classified under the headings shown in Figure 13.2. Primary shaping create shapes. The first row lists six classes of primary forming processes: casting, molding, deformation, powder methods, methods for forming composites, and special methods such as rapid prototyping. Secondary processes modify shapes or properties; here they are shown as “machining,” which adds features to an already shaped body, and “heat treatment,” which enhances surface or bulk properties. Below these come joining an, surface treatment or finishing. Figure 13.2 has merit as a flow chart; it shows a progression through the manufacturing route. It should not be treated too literally, however; the order of the steps can be varied to suit the needs of the design. The point it makes is that there are three broad process families: shaping, joining, and finishing. The attributes of one family differ so greatly from those of another that, in assembling and structuring data for them, they must be treated separately. To organize processes in more detail, we need a hierarchical classification like that used for materials in Chapter 5. Figure 13.3 shows part of it. The process universe has three families: shaping, joining, and finishing. In this figure, the shaping family is expanded to show classes: casting, deformation,\n \n 369\n \n 370\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n Raw materials Primary shaping Casting methods: Sand Die Investment\n \n Molding methods: Injection Compression Blow molding\n \n Secondary processes\n \n Deformation methods: Rolling Forging Drawing\n \n Powder methods: Sintering HIPing Slip casting\n \n Machining: Cut, turn, plane drill, grind\n \n Heat-treat: Quench, temper, age-harden\n \n Composite forming: Hand lay-up Filament winding RTM\n \n Joining\n \n Special methods: Rapid prototype Lay-up Electro-form\n \n Surface treatment\n \n Fastening Riveting\n \n Welding Heat bonding\n \n Polishing Texturing\n \n Plating Metallizing\n \n Snap fits Friction bond\n \n Adhesives Cements\n \n Anodizing Chromizing\n \n Painting Printing\n \n Finished product\n \n FIGURE 13.2 The classes of process.

One of these—molding—is again expanded to show its members: rotation molding, blow molding, injection molding, and so forth. Each of these has certain attributes: the materials it can handle, the shapes it can makes, their size, precision, and an optimum batch size (the number of units that molding can make economically).\n \n Expanding members of the shaping family Expanding the casting family at about the same level of detail as that used for molding in the figure gives the result: 1. 2. 3. 4.\n \n Sand casting Shaping–casting Die casting Investment casting\n \n The other two families are partly expanded in Figure 13.4.

As before, each member has attributes. The first is the materials it can join. After that the attribute list differs from that for shaping. Here the geometry of the joint and the way it will be loaded are important, as are requirements that the joint can or cannot be disassembled, that it be watertight, that it be electrically conducting, and the like. The lower part of the figure expands the family of finishing. Some of the classes it contains are shown; one—coating—is expanded to show some of its members. As with shaping and joining, the material to be coated is an important attribute but the others differ. Most important is the purpose of the treatment (protection, surface hardening, decoration, etc.), followed by properties of the coating itself.\n \n Expanding the joining family Expanding the fasteners family at about the same level of detail as that used for molding in the figure, gives the result: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.\n \n Rivets and staples Joining—fasteners Threaded fasteners Sewing Snap fits\n \n With this background we can embark on a lightning tour of processes. It will be kept as concise as possible; details can be found in the numerous books listed in “Further reading” (Section 13.9).\n \n 13.3 THE PROCESSES: SHAPING, JOINING, FINISHING Shaping processes In casting (Figure 13.5), a liquid is poured or forced into a mold where it solidifies by cooling. Casting is distinguished from molding, which comes next, by the low viscosity of the liquid: It fills the mold by flow under its own weight (as in gravity sand and investment casting) or under a modest pressure (as in die casting and pressure sand casting). Sand molds for oneoff castings are cheap; metal dies for die casting large batches can be expensive. Between these extremes lie a number of other casting methods: shell, investment, plaster mold, and so forth.\n \n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing\n \n FIGURE 13.5 Casting processes. In sand casting, liquid metal is poured into a split sand mold. In die casting, liquid is forced under pressure into a metal mold. In investment casting, a wax pattern is embedded in a refractory, melted out, and the cavity filled with metal. In pressure casting, a die is filled from below, giving control of atmosphere and of the flow of metal into the die.\n \n Cast shapes must be designed for easy flow of liquid to all parts of the mold, and for progressive solidification that does not trap pockets of liquid in a solid shell, giving shrinkage cavities. Whenever possible, section thicknesses are made uniform (the thickness of adjoining sections should not\n \n 373\n \n 374\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n differ by more than a factor of 2). The shape is designed so that the pattern and the finished casting can be removed from the mold. Keyed-in shapes are avoided because they lead to “hot tearing” (a tensile creep fracture) as the solid cools and shrinks. The tolerance and surface finish of a casting vary from poor for sand casting to excellent for precision die castings; they are quantified in Section 13.6. When metal is poured into a mold, the flow is turbulent, trapping surface oxide and debris within the casting, giving casting defects. These are avoided by filling the mold from below in such a way that flow is laminar, driven by a vacuum or gas pressure, as shown in Figure 13.5. Molding Figure 13.6 shows casting, adapted to materials that are very viscous when molten, particularly thermoplastics and glasses. The hot, viscous fluid is pressed or injected into a die under considerable pressure, where it cools and solidifies. The die must withstand repeated application of pressure, temperature, and the wear involved in separating and removing the part, and therefore it is expensive. Elaborate shapes can be molded, but at the penalty of complexity in die shape and in the way it separates to allow removal. The molds for thermo-forming, by contrast, are cheap. Variants of the process use gas pressure or vacuum to press a heated polymer sheet onto a single-part mold. Blow molding, too, uses a gas pressure to expand a polymer or glass blank into a split outer die. It is a rapid, low-cost process well suited for mass production of cheap parts like milk bottles. Polymers, such as metals, can be extruded; virtually all rods, tubes, and other prismatic sections are made in this way. Deformation processing Figure 13.7 shows that the deformation process can be hot, warm, or cold—cold, that is, relative to the melting point Tm of the material being processed. Extrusion, hot forging, and hot rolling (T &gt; 0.55 Tm) have much in common with molding, though the material is a true solid, not a viscous liquid. The high temperature lowers the yield strength and allows simultaneous recrystallization, both of which lower the forming pressures. Warm working (0.35 Tm &lt; T &lt; 0.55 Tm) allows recovery but not recrystallization. Cold forging, rolling, and drawing (T &lt; 0.35 Tm) exploit work hardening to increase the strength of the final product, but at the penalty of higher forming pressures. Forged parts are designed to avoid sudden changes in thickness and sharp radii of curvature since both require large local strains that can cause the material to tear or to fold back on itself (“lapping”). Hot forging of metals allows larger changes of shape but generally gives a poor surface and tolerance because of oxidation and warpage. Cold forging gives greater precision and finish, but forging pressures are higher and the deformations are limited by work hardening.\n \n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing\n \n FIGURE 13.6 Molding processes. In injection molding, a granular polymer (or filled polymer) is heated, compressed, and sheared by a screw feeder, forcing it into the mold cavity. In blow molding, a tubular blank of hot polymer or glass is expanded by gas pressure against the inner wall of a split die. In polymer extrusion, shaped sections are formed by extrusion through a shaped die. In thermo-forming, a sheet of thermoplastic is heated and deformed into a female die by vacuum or gas pressure.\n \n Powder methods Figure 13.8 shows that powder methods create the shape by pressing and then sintering fine particles of the material. The powder can be cold-pressed and then sintered (heated at up to 0.8 Tm to give diffusion bonding); it can be pressed in a heated die (“die pressing”); or, contained in a thin preform, it can be heated under a hydrostatic pressure (“hot isostatic pressing”\n \n 375\n \n 376\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n FIGURE 13.7 Deformation processes. In forging, a slug of metal is shaped between two dies held in the jaws of a press. In rolling, a billet or bar is reduced in section by compressive deformation between the rolls. In extrusion, metal is forced to flow through a die aperture to give a continuous prismatic shape. All three processes can be hot (T &gt; 0.85 Tm ), warm (0.55 Tm &lt; T &lt; 0.85 Tm ), or cold (T &lt; 0.35 Tm ). In spinning, a spinning disc of ductile metal is shaped over a wooden pattern by repeated sweeps of the smooth, rounded tool.\n \n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing\n \n FIGURE 13.8 Powder processing. In die-pressing and sintering the powder is compacted in a die, often with a binder, and the green compact is then fired to give a more or less dense product. In hot isostatic pressing, powder in a thin, shaped shell or preform is heated and compressed by an external gas pressure. In powder injection molding, powder and binder are forced into a die to give a green blank that is then fired. In slip casting, a water-based powder slurry is poured into a porous plaster mold that absorbs the water, leaving a powder shell that is subsequently fired.\n \n 377\n \n 378\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n or “HIPing”). Metals that are too high-melting to cast and too strong to deform can be made (by chemical methods) into powders and then shaped in this way. But the processes are not limited to “difficult” materials; almost any material can be shaped by subjecting it, as a powder, to pressure and heat. Powder processing is most widely used for small metallic parts like gears and bearings for cars and appliances. It is economic in its use of material; it allows parts to be fabricated from materials that cannot be cast, deformed, or machined; and it can give a product that requires little or no finishing. Since pressure is not transmitted uniformly through a bed of powder, the length of a die-pressed powder part should not exceed 2.5 times its diameter. Sections must be near uniform because the powder will not flow easily around corners. And the shape must be simple and easily extracted from the die. Ceramics, difficult to cast and impossible to deform, are routinely shaped by powder methods. In slip casting, a water-based powder slurry is poured into a plaster mold. The mold wall absorbs water, leaving a semi-dry skin of slurry over its inner wall. The remaining liquid is drained out, and the dired slurry shell is fired to give a ceramic body. In powder injection molding (the way spark-plug insulators are made) a ceramic powder in a polymer binder is molded in the conventional way; the molded part is fired, burning the binder and sintering the powder. Composite forming methods, as shown in Figure 13.9, make polymer-matrix composites reinforced with continuous or chopped fibers. Large components are fabricated by filament winding or by laying up preimpregnated mats of carbon, glass, or Kevlar fiber (“pre-preg”) to the required thickness, pressing, and curing. Parts of the process can be automated, but it remains a slow manufacturing route; and, if the component is a critical one, extensive ultrasonic testing may be necessary to confirm its integrity. Higher integrity is given by vacuum-bag or pressure-bag molding, which squeezes bubbles out of the matrix before it polymerizes. Lay-up methods are best suited to a small number of high-performance, tailor-made components. More routine components (car bumpers, tennis racquets) are made from chopped-fiber composites by pressing and heating a “dough” of resin containing the fibers, known as bulk molding compound (BMC) or sheet molding compound (SMC), in a mold, or by injection molding a rather more fluid mixture into a die. The flow pattern is critical in aligning the fibers, so the designer must work closely with the manufacturer to exploit the composite properties fully. Rapid prototyping systems (RPS) allow single examples of complex shapes to be made from numerical data generated by CAD solid-modeling software (see Figure 13.10). The motive may be that of visualization: The aesthetics of an object may be evident only when viewed as a prototype. It may be\n \n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing\n \n FIGURE 13.9 Composite forming methods. In filament winding, fibers of glass, Kevlar, or carbon are wound onto a former and impregnated with a resin-hardener mix. In roll and spray lay-up, fiber reinforcement is laid up in a mold onto which the resin-hardener mix is rolled or sprayed. In vacuum-bag and pressure-bag molding, laid-up fiber reinforcement, impregnated with resin-hardener mix, is compressed and heated to cause polymerization. In pultrusion, fibers are fed through a resin bath into a heated die to form continuous prismatic sections.\n \n 379\n \n 380\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n FIGURE 13.10 Rapid prototyping. In deposition modeling and ballistic particle manufacture (BPM), a solid body is created by the layer-by-layer deposition of polymer droplets. In stereo-lithography (SLA), a solid shape is created layer by layer by laser-induced polymerization of a resin. In direct mold modeling, a sand mold is built up layer by layer by selective spraying of a binder from a scanning print-head. In laminated object manufacture (LOM), a solid body is created from layers of paper, cut by a scanning laser beam and bonded with a heat-sensitive polymer.\n \n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing\n \n that of pattern-making: The prototype becomes the master from which molds for conventional processing, such as casting, can be made. Or—in complex assemblies—it may be that of validating intricate geometry, ensuring that parts fit, can be assembled, and are accessible. All RPSs can create shapes of great complexity with internal cavities, overhangs, and transverse features, though the precision, at present, is limited to ± 0.3 mm at best. All RP methods build shapes layer by layer, rather like three-dimensional printing, and are slow (typically 4–40 hours per unit). There are at least six broad classes. 1. The shape is built up from a thermoplastic fed to a single scanning head that extrudes it like a thin layer of toothpaste (fused deposition modeling or FDM), exudes it as tiny droplets (ballistic particle manufacture, BPM), or ejects it in a patterned array like a bubble-jet printer (“3D printing”). 2. Scanned-laser–induced polymerization of a photo-sensitive monomer (stereo-lithography or SLA). After each scan, the work piece is incrementally lowered, allowing fresh monomer to cover the surface. 3. Scanned laser cutting of bondable paper elements. Each paper-thin layer is cut by a laser beam and heat-bonded to the next one. 4. Screen-based technology like that used to produce microcircuits (solid ground curing or SGC). A succession of screens admits UV light to polymerize a photo-sensitive monomer, building shapes layer by layer. 5. Selected laser sintering (SLS) allows components to be fabricated directly in thermoplastic, metal, or ceramic. A laser, as in SLA, scans a bed of particles, sintering a thin surface layer where the beam strikes. A new layer of particles is swept across the surface and the laser-sintering step is repeated, building up a three-dimensional body. 6. Bonded sand molding offers the ability to make large complex metal parts easily. Here a multi-jet print-head squirts a binder onto a bed of loose casting sand, building up the mold shape much as selected laser sintering does, but more quickly. When complete, the mold is lifted from the remaining loose sand and used in a conventional casting process. To be useful, prototypes made by RPS are used as silicone molding masters, allowing replicas to be cast using high-temperature resins or metals. Almost all engineering components, whether made of metal, polymer, or ceramic, are subjected to some kind of machining (Figure 13.11) during manufacture. To make this possible they should be designed to make gripping and jigging easy and to keep the symmetry high: Symmetric shapes need fewer operations. Metals differ greatly in their machinability, a measure of the ease of chip formation, the ability to give a smooth surface, and the ability to give economical tool life (evaluated in a standard test). Poor machinability means higher cost.\n \n 381\n \n 382\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n FIGURE 13.11 Machining operations. In turning and milling, the sharp, hardened tip of a tool cuts a chip from the work piece surface. In drawing, blanking, and stretching, sheet is shaped and cut to give flat and dished shapes. In electro-discharge machining, electric discharge between a graphite electrode and the work piece, submerged in a dielectric such as paraffin, erodes the work piece to the desired shape. In water-jet cutting, an abrasive entrained in a high-speed water jet erodes the material in its path.\n \n Most polymers are molded into a final shape. When necessary they can be machined but their low moduli mean that they deflect elastically during the machining operation, limiting tolerance. Ceramics and glasses can be ground and lapped to high tolerance and finish (think of the mirrors of telescopes). There are many “special” machining techniques with particular applications\n \n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing\n \n including: electro-discharge machining (EDM), ultrasonic cutting, chemical milling, and cutting by water and sand jets and electron and laser beams. Sheet metal forming involves punching, bending, and stretching. Holes cannot be punched to a diameter less than the thickness of the sheet. The minimum radius to which a sheet can be bent, its formability, is sometimes expressed in multiples of the sheet thickness t: A value of 1 is good; one of 4 is average. Radii are best made as large as possible, and never less than t. The formability also determines the amount the sheet can be stretched or drawn without necking and failing. The forming limit diagram gives more precise information: It shows the combination of principal strains in the plane of the sheet that will cause failure. The part is designed so that the strains do not exceed this limit. Machining is often a secondary operation applied to castings, moldings, or powder products to increase finish and tolerance. Higher finish and tolerance mean higher cost; over-specifying either is a mistake.\n \n Joining processes Joining Figure 13.12 shows that joining is made possible by a number of techniques. Almost any material can be joined with adhesives, though ensuring a sound, durable bond can be difficult. Bolting, riveting, stapling, and snap fitting are commonly used to join polymers and metals, and have the feature that they can be disassembled if need be. Welding, the largest class of joining processes, is widely used to bond metals and polymers; specialized techniques have evolved to deal with each class. Friction welding and friction-stir welding rely on the heat and deformation generated by friction to create a bond between different metals. Ceramics can be diffusionbonded to themselves, to glasses, and to metals. If components are to be welded, the material of which they are made must be characterized by a high weldability. Like machinability, it measures a combination of basic properties. A low thermal conductivity allows welding with a low rate of heat input, but can lead to greater distortion on cooling. Low thermal expansion gives small thermal strains with less risk of distortion. A solid solution is better than an age-hardened alloy because, in the heat-affected zone on either side of the weld, over-aging and softening can occur. Welding always leaves internal stresses that are roughly equal to the yield strength of the parent material. They can be relaxed by heat treatment but this is expensive, so it is better to minimize their effect by good design. To achieve this, parts to be welded are made of equal thickness whenever possible, the welds are located where stress or deflection is least critical, and the total number of welds is minimized.\n \n 383\n \n 384\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n FIGURE 13.12 Joining operations. In adhesive bonding, a film of adhesive is applied to one surface, which is then pressed onto the mating one. Fastening is achieved by bolting; riveting; stapling; push-through snap fastener; push-on snap fastener; or rod-to-sheet snap fastener. In metal fusion welding, metal is melted, and more is added from a filler rod to give a bond or coating. In thermoplastic polymer welding, heat is applied to the polymer components, which are simultaneously pressed together to form a bond.\n \n The large-volume use of fasteners is costly; welding, crimping, or the use of adhesives can be more economical. Design for assembly (DFA) methods provide a checklist to guide minimizing assembly time.\n \n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing\n \n Finishing processes Finishing involves treatments applied to the surface of the component or assembly. Some aim to improve mechanical and other engineering properties, others to enhance appearance. Finishing treatments to improve engineering properties (Figure 13.13) Grinding, lapping, and polishing increase precision and smoothness, particularly important for bearing surfaces. Electroplating deposits a thin metal layer onto the surface of a component to give resistance to corrosion and abrasion. Plating and painting are both made easier by a simple part shape with largely convex surfaces: Channels, crevices, and slots are difficult to reach. Anodizing, phosphating, and chromating create a thin layer of oxide, phosphate, or chromate on the surface, imparting corrosion resistance. Heat treatment is a necessary part of the processing of many materials. Agehardening alloys of aluminum, titanium, and nickel derive their strength from a precipitate produced by a controlled heat treatment: quenching from a high temperature followed by aging at a lower one. The hardness and toughness of steels are controlled in a similar way: by quenching from the “austenitizing” temperature (about 800°C) and tempering. The treatment can be applied to the entire component, as in bulk carburizing, or just to a surface layer, as in flame hardening, induction hardening, and laser surface hardening. Quenching—very rapid cooling—is a savage procedure; the sudden thermal contraction associated with it can produce stresses large enough to distort or crack the component. The stresses are caused by a nonuniform temperature distribution, and this, in turn, is related to the geometry of the component. To avoid damaging stresses, the section thickness should be as uniform as possible, and nowhere so large that the quench rate falls below the critical value required for successful heat treatment. Stress concentrations should be avoided because they are a source of quench cracks. Materials that have been molded or deformed may contain internal stresses that can be removed, at least partially, by stress-relief anneals—another sort of heat treatment. Finishing treatments that enhance aesthetics (Figure 13.14) The processes just described can be used to enhance the visual and tactile attributes of a material: Electroplating and anodizing are examples. There are many more, of which painting is the most widely used. Organic-solvent–based paints give durable coatings with high finish, but the solvent poses environmental problems. Water-based paints overcome these, but dry more slowly and the resulting paint film is less perfect. In polymer powder-coating and polymer powder-spraying a film of thermoplastic—nylon, polypropylene, or polyethylene—is deposited on the surface, giving a protective layer that can be brightly colored.\n \n 385\n \n 386\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n FIGURE 13.13 Finishing processes to protect and enhance properties. In mechanical polishing, the roughness of a surface is reduced and its precision increase, by material removal using finely ground abrasives. In electroplating, metal is plated onto a conducting work piece by electro-deposition in a plating bath. In heat treatment, a surface layer of the work piece is hardened and made more corrosion resistant by the inward diffusion of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, or aluminum from a powder bed or molten bath. In anodizing, a surface oxide layer is built up on the work piece (which must be aluminum, magnesium, titanium, or zinc) by a potential gradient in an oxidizing bath.\n \n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing\n \n FIGURE 13.14 Finishing processes to enhance appearance. In paint spraying, a pigment in an organic- or water-based solvent is sprayed onto the surface to be decorated. In polymer powder-coating a layer of thermoplastic is deposited on the surface by direct spraying in a gas flame, or by immersing the hot work piece in a bed of powder. In silk-screen printing, ink is wiped onto the surface through a screen onto which a blocking pattern has been deposited, allowing ink to pass in selected areas only. In pad-printing, an inked pattern is picked up on a rubber pad and applied to the surface, which can be curved or irregular.\n \n In screen printing an oil-based ink is squeegeed through a mesh on which a blocking film holds back the ink where it is not wanted; full-color printing requires the successive use of up to four screens. Screen printing is widely used to apply designs to flat surfaces. Curved surfaces require the use of pad printing,\n \n 387\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n in which a pattern, etched onto a metal “cliche,” is inked and picked up on a soft rubber pad. The pad is pressed onto the product, depositing the pattern on its surface; the compliant rubber conforms to the curvature of the surface. Enough of the processes themselves; for more detail the reader will have to consult “Further reading” in Section 13.9. Now a brief look at what processing does to properties.\n \n 13.4 PROCESSING FOR PROPERTIES The extent of the material bubbles in the property charts gives an idea of the degree to which properties can be manipulated by processing.

The modulus and strength of polymers and elastomers depend on the chain length and degree of cross-linking, aspects of structure directly controlled by processing. The strength, particularly, of ceramics depends on porosity, another aspect of microstructure that is directly influenced by processing.\n \n Fracture toughness K1c (MPa.m1/2)\n \n 13.4 Processing for Properties\n \n Polypropylene\n \n 40% long glass fiber\n \n 10\n \n Glass fibers Impact modifiers\n \n 5\n \n 30% PAN carbon fiber 20% long glass fiber\n \n PP with EPR PP copolymer\n \n 2\n \n Homopolymer PP\n \n Carbon fibers\n \n Gc = 10 kJ/m2 10% CaCO3\n \n 1\n \n 0.5\n \n 40% Talc\n \n 40% CaCO3\n \n Fillers 20% CaCO3 Gc = 1 kJ/m2\n \n MFA, 10\n \n 0.2 0.5 1 2 5 10 20 We have already seen, in Figures 11.7 and 11.10, Young’s modulus E (GPa) how fiber content, shape, and orientation control composite properties, and in Figure 11.24 how FIGURE 13.16 the foam density and connectivity dramatically The strength and toughness of polypropylene, showing the effect influence the properties of cellular solids. The of fillers, impact modifiers, and fibers. strengths of polymers span around a factor of 5 and their fracture toughnesses a factor of 20, depending on chemistry, chain length, and degree of cross-linking. More dramatic changes are possible by blending, filling, reinforcing, or plasticizing. Figure 13.16 shows how these influence the modulus E and fracture toughness Klc of polypropylene, PP. Blending or copolymerization with elastomers, such as EPR or EDPM (“impact modifiers”), reduces the modulus but increases the fracture toughness Klc and toughness Gc. Filling with inexpensive powdered glass, talc, or calcium carbonate more than doubles the modulus; however, that is at the expense of some loss of toughness. Plasticizing (blending with low-molecularweight polymers) lowers the modulus even more dramatically. Between them, these processes can change the polymer modulus by a factor of 100 and the toughness by a factor of 10.\n \n Of all the properties that materials scientists and engineers have sought to manipulate, the strength of metals and alloys is probably the most explored. It is easy to see why—Table 13.1 lists some of their applications. Solution hardening, precipitation hardening, and work hardening are combined to give desired combinations of strength and toughness. Figure 13.17 illustrates the large gains in strength of copper alloys that these mechanisms allow. Good things, however, have to be paid for. Here the payment required for increased strength is loss of ductility, in this case measured by the elongation to fracture εf. Strength and ductility are structure-sensitive properties—they depend on composition and microstructure, and these, in turn, are controlled by\n \n 389\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n Table 13.1 Metal Alloys with Typical Applications, Indicating the Strengthening Mechanisms Used Solution Hardening\n \n Alloy\n \n Typical Uses\n \n Pure Al\n \n Kitchen foil\n \n Pure Cu\n \n Wire\n \n Cast Al, Mg\n \n Automotive parts Marine components\n \n ✓✓✓ ✓✓✓\n \n Bronze (Cu-Sn), Brass (Cu-Zn) Non-heat-treatable wrought Al\n \n Precipitate Hardening\n \n Work Hardening ✓✓✓ ✓✓✓\n \n ✓ ✓\n \n ✓ ✓✓✓ ✓\n \n Ships, cans, structures\n \n ✓✓✓\n \n Heat-treatable wrought Al Low carbon steels\n \n Aircraft, structures Car bodies, structures, ships, cans\n \n ✓ ✓✓✓\n \n ✓✓✓\n \n Low alloy steels Stainless steels Cast Ni alloys\n \n Automotive parts, tools Pressure vessels Jet engine turbines\n \n ✓ ✓✓✓ ✓✓✓\n \n ✓✓✓ ✓ ✓✓✓\n \n ✓✓✓ ✓ ✓✓✓\n \n Symbols: ✓✓✓ = routinely used; ✓ = sometimes used.\n \n 2000 Yield strength σy, tension (MPa)\n \n 390\n \n Copper-beryllium alloys\n \n 1000 500\n \n 200\n \n Precipitation hardening\n \n Strengthening copper alloys Brass, work hardened Pure copper, work hardened\n \n Work hardening\n \n 100\n \n Brass, soft Solution hardening\n \n 50\n \n Pure, soft copper MFA, 10\n \n 20 1\n \n 10 Elongation ε f (%)\n \n 100\n \n FIGURE 13.17 Strengthening mechanisms and the consequent drop in ductility, here shown for copper alloys.

Hardness, fatigue strength, fracture toughness, and thermal and electrical conductivities, too, are structure-sensitive properties. Much processing is fine-tuned to produce particular combinations of these. They are best illustrated as mini property charts, like Figures 13.16 and 13.17. Materials for heat transfer—heat exchangers, chemical engineering equipment—require\n \n 13.4 Processing for Properties\n \n Nowhere is processing for properties more important than in the heat treatment of steels. Figure 13.20 shows the sequence for a mediumcarbon steel. The steel is solutionized (heated into the FCC austenite field) to dissolve all of the carbon it then quenched in water or oil, which causes it to transform to hard, brittle martensite. Martensite has high hardness but is so brittle—its fracture toughness is so low that it is almost useless as a structural material. Tempering reduces the hardness and yield strength but restores toughness to a degree that depends on the tempering temperature and time. The desired property set is obtained by controlling these.\n \n Thermal conductivity λ (W/m.K)\n \n Hardening of aluminum alloys 400 Commercial heat exchanger alloys\n \n Pure Al\n \n 300 Work hardening\n \n 200 So\n \n Pre\n \n lut ion\n \n cipit ation harden ing\n \n ha rde\n \n nin g\n \n + Work hardening\n \n 100\n \n Aluminum alloys\n \n 50 10\n \n MFA, 10\n \n 30 100 300 Yield strength σy (MPa)\n \n 1000\n \n FIGURE 13.18 Thermal conductivity and strength for aluminum alloys.\n \n Strong conductors\n \n Copperberyllium Conductor materials Hard drawn copper\n \n h ar den ing\n \n 300\n \n 100\n \n Solu\n \n te\n \n Coppernickel, hard drawn\n \n Brasses, bronzes, hard drawn\n \n g enin hard\n \n o en r k ing\n \n 1000\n \n Work hardening Pr ec ipi ta t e\n \n Figure 13.19 illustrates this for one of the best conductors that we have: copper. Adding solute increases its strength, but the solute atoms also act as scattering centers, increasing the electrical resistivity too. Dislocations add strength (by what we called work hardening) and they too scatter electrons a little, though not as much as solute.

Figure 13.21 lists the now-familiar steps: translation, screening, ranking, and documentation. Translation As we saw in earlier chapters, the function of a component dictates the initial choice of material and shape. This choice exerts constraints on the choice of processes. It is helpful to think of two types of constraint: technical—can the process do the job at all? And quality—can it do so sufficiently well? One technical constraint is always there: the compatibility of material and process. Quality constraints include achieving the desired precision, surface finish, and property profile while avoiding defects. The usual objective in processing is to minimize cost. The free variables are largely limited to choosing the process itself and its operating parameters (such as temperatures, flow rates, and so on). Table 13.2 summarizes the outcome of the translation stage. Screening The screening step applies the constraints, eliminating processes that cannot meet them. Some process attributes are simple numeric ranges—the size or mass of component the process can handle, the precision, or the surface smoothness it can achieve. Others are nonnumeric—lists of materials to which the process can be applied, for example. Requirements such as “made of magnesium and weighing about 3 kg” are easily compared with the process attributes to eliminate those that cannot shape magnesium or cannot handle a component as large as 3 kg.\n \n 13.5 Systematic Process Selection\n \n Ranking Ranking, as before, is based on one or more objectives, the most obvious of which is that of minimizing cost. In certain demanding applications it may be replaced by the objective of maximizing quality regardless of cost, though more usually it is a trade-off between the two that is sought. Documentation Screening and ranking do not cope adequately with the less tractable issues of quality and productivity; they are best explored through a search for documentation—that is, design guidelines, best practice guides, case studies, and failure analyses. All processes The most important technical expertise relates to productivity and quality. All types of processing equipment Translate design requirements have optimum operating condition identify function, technical, and quality constraints, objectives, and free variables ranges under which they work best and produce products with uncompromised quality. Failure to operate Screen using constraints within this window can lead to manueliminate processes that facturing defects, such as excessive cannot do the job porosity, cracking, or residual stress. This in turn leads to scrap and lost productivity, and, if passed on to the Rank using objective user, may cause premature failure. find the screened processes that do the job most economically Documentation is an essential part of the selection exercise.

Shaping processes are at the top, with compatible combinations marked by colored dots that identify the material family. Its use for screening is straightforward: Specify the material and read off the processes or the reverse: specify the process and read off the materials. The diagonal spread of the dots in the matrix reveals that each material class—metals,\n \n Joining\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Finishing\n \n 394\n \n MFA, 09\n \n 13.5 Systematic Process Selection\n \n polymers, and such—has its own set of process routes. There are some overlaps —powder methods are compatible with both metals and ceramics, molding with both polymers and glasses. Machining (when used for shaping) is compatible with almost all families. Joining processes using adhesives and fasteners are very versatile and can be used with most materials, whereas welding methods are material-specific. Finishing processes are used primarily for the harder materials, particularly metals; polymers are molded to shape and rarely treated further except for decorative purposes. We will see why later. Process-shape compatibility Shape is the most difficult attribute to characterize. Many processes involve rotation or translation of a tool or of the material, directing our thinking toward axial symmetry, translational symmetry, uniformity of section, and the like. Turning creates axisymmetric (or circular) shapes; extrusion, drawing, and rolling make prismatic shapes, both circular and noncircular. Sheet-forming processes make flat shapes (stamping) or dished shapes (drawing). Certain processes can make three-dimensional shapes, and among these some can make hollow shapes whereas others cannot. Figure 13.23 illustrates this classification scheme. The prismatic shapes shown on the left, made by rolling, extrusion, or drawing, have a special feature: They can be made in continuous lengths. The other shapes cannot—they are discrete, and the processes that make them are called batch processes. Continuous processes are well suited to long, prismatic products such as railway track or standard stock such as tube, plate, and sheet. Cylindrical rolls produce sheets. Shaped rolls make more complex profiles—rail track is one. Extrusion is a particularly versatile continuous process, since complex prismatic profiles that include internal channels and longitudinal features such as ribs and stiffeners can be manufactured in one step. The process-shape matrix displays the links between the two. If the process cannot make the shape we want, it may be possible to combine it with a secondary process to give a process chain that adds the additional features: Casting followed by machining is an obvious example. But remember: Every additional process step adds cost. Shaping processes: Mass and section thickness There are limits to the size of component that a process can make. Figure 13.24 shows the limits. The color coding for material compatibility has been retained, using more than one color when the process can treat more than one material family. Size can be measured by volume or by mass, but since the range of either one covers many orders of magnitude, whereas densities span only a factor of about 50, it doesn’t make much difference which we use—big things are heavy, whatever they are made of. Most processes span a mass range of about a factor of 1000 or so. Note that this attribute is most discriminating at the extremes; the vast majority of components are in the 0.1 to 10 kg range, for which virtually any process will work.\n \n 395\n \n 396\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n FIGURE 13.23 The process-shape matrix. Information about material compatibility is included at the extreme left.\n \n Each bar spans the size range of which the process is capable without undue technical difficulty. All can be stretched to smaller or larger extremes but at the penalty of extra cost because the equipment is no longer standard. During screening, therefore, it is important to recognize “near misses”— processes that narrowly failed, but that could, if needed, be reconsidered and used. Figure 13.25 shows a second bar chart: that for the ranges of section thickness of which each shaping process is capable. It is the lower end of the ranges— the minimum section thickness—where the physics of the process imposes limits. The origins of these limits are the subject of the next subsection.\n \n Composite shaping\n \n Polymer shaping\n \n Ceramic shaping\n \n Metal shaping\n \n 13.5 Systematic Process Selection\n \n Sand casting Die casting Investment casting Low-pressure casting Forging Extrusion Sheet forming Powder methods Electro-machining Conventional machining Injection molding Blow molding Compression molding Rotational molding Thermo-forming Polymer casting Resin-transfer molding Filament winding Lay-up methods Vacuum bag\n \n Joining\n \n 10−3\n \n 10−2\n \n 0.1\n \n 1 10 Mass (kg)\n \n 102\n \n 103\n \n 104\n \n Adhesives Welding, metals Welding, polymers Fasteners metal\n \n ceramic\n \n polymer\n \n composite\n \n FIGURE 13.24 The process–mass-range chart. The inclusion of joining allows simple process chains to be explored.\n \n Physical limits to size and section thickness Casting and molding both rely on material flow in the liquid or semiliquid state. Lower limits on section thickness are imposed by the physics of flow. Viscosity and surface tension oppose flow through narrow channels, and heat loss from the large surface area of thin sections cools the flowing material, raising the viscosity before the channel is filled (Figure 13.26). Pure metals solidify at a fixed temperature, with a step increase in viscosity, but for alloys solidification happens over a range of temperature, known as the “mushy zone,” in which the alloy is part liquid, part solid. The width of this zone can vary from a few degrees centigrade to several hundred—so metal flow in castings depends on alloy composition. In general, higher-pressure die casting and molding methods enable thinner sections to be made, but the equipment costs more and the faster, more turbulent flow can entrap more porosity and cause damage to the molds.\n \n MFA, 09\n \n 397\n \n Metal shaping\n \n Polymer shaping\n \n Ceramic shaping\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Composite shaping\n \n 398\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n Sand casting Die casting Investment casting Low-pressure casting Forging Extrusion Sheet forming Powder methods Electro-machining Conventional machining Injection molding Blow molding Compression molding Rotational molding Thermo-forming Polymer casting Resin-transfer molding Filament winding Lay-up methods Vacuum bag 0.1\n \n 1 metal\n \n ceramic\n \n 10 polymer\n \n composite\n \n 100\n \n 1000 MFA, 09\n \n Section thickness (mm)\n \n FIGURE 13.25 The process–section thickness chart.\n \n Upper limits to size and section in casting and molding are set by problems of shrinkage. The outer layer of a casting or molding cools and solidifies first, giving it a rigid skin. When the interior subsequently solidifies, the change in volume can distort the product or crack the skin, or cause internal cavitation. Problems of this sort are most severe where there are changes of section, since the constraint introduces tensile stresses that cause hot tearing—cracking\n \n Flow in thin channels A mold for casting an intricate aluminum casting has some channel-like features with a width of only 10 μm. Will an overpressure of 1 atmosphere (0.1 MPa) be sufficient to overcome surface tension, allowing the feature to be filled? The surface tension γ of liquid aluminum is 1.1 J/m2.\n \n p = γ/x. Thus the narrowest channel that can be filled with an overpressure of 1 atmosphere is\n \n Answer\n \n An overpressure of 1 atmosphere is not sufficient to fill the channel.

Loss of heat into the mold increases viscosity and may cause premature solidification.\n \n caused by constrained thermal contraction. Different compositions have different susceptibilities to hot tearing—another example of coupling between material, process, and design detail. Metal shaping by deformation—hot or cold rolling, forging, or extrusion— also involves flow. The thinness that can be forged, rolled, or extruded is limited by plastic flow in much the same way that the thinness in casting is limited by viscosity: The thinner the section, the greater the required roll pressure or forging force. Figure 13.27 illustrates the problem. Friction changes the pressure distribution on the die and under the rolls. When they are well-lubricated, as in (a), the loading is almost uniaxial and the material flows at its yield stress σy. With friction, as in (b), the metal shears at the die interface and the pressure ramps up because the friction resists the lateral spreading, giving a “friction hill.” The area under the pressure distribution is the total forming load, so friction increases the load. The greater the aspect ratio of the section (width/thickness), the higher the maximum pressure needed to cause yielding, as in (c). This illustrates the fundamental limit of friction on section thickness—very thin sections simply stick to the tools and will not yield, even with very large pressures. Friction also limits aspect ratio in powder processing. The externally applied pressure is diminished by die-wall friction (Figure 13.28) with the result\n \n 399\n \n 400\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n p=σy τ =0\n \n τ = 0 Tool Billet Tool (a) pmax = 5 − 10 σ y\n \n pmax = 2 − 3 σ y Friction hill\n \n Friction hill\n \n p=σy τ =k\n \n τ =k\n \n p=σy\n \n Tool Barreling\n \n τ =k\n \n τ =k\n \n Billet\n \n Tool\n \n Tool\n \n (b)\n \n Tool\n \n (c)\n \n FIGURE 13.27 The influence of friction and aspect ratio on forging: (a) uniaxial compression with very low friction; (b) with sticking friction the contact pressure rises in a friction hill; (c) the greater the aspect ratio, the greater the pressure rise, ultimately limiting the thinness that can be achieved.\n \n Limiting aspect ratio for powder pressing How large is the pressure drop in a cylindrical powder mass like that in Figure 13.28 caused by die-wall friction if the coefficient of friction on the die wall is μ = 0.5?\n \n Answer The frictional force opposing sliding in the green band of thickness dx is 2π r μ p dx where p is the pressure at a distance x below the die face. Dividing this by the cross-section area of the powder pack πr 2 gives the pressure drop dp = − 2 μ p dx r Integrating from x = 0 where p = po to x = x where p = p(x) gives 2μx r With a coefficient of friction of μ = 0.5, the pressure drops to half its remote value po at a depth-to-radius ratio of only pðx Þ = po exp −\n \n x = − 1 ln ð1Þ = 0:69 r 2μ 2 The answer is to lubricate the mold, reducing μ.\n \n 13.5 Systematic Process Selection\n \n FIGURE 13.28 The height-to-width aspect ratio in powder forging is limited by die-wall friction, which causes the compaction pressure to fall exponentially with distance from the surface.\n \n that, if the aspect ratio is too great, there is insufficient pressure to compact powder in the center of the product. Tolerance and roughness The precision and surface finish of a component are aspects of its quality. They are measured by the tolerance and the surface roughness R. When the dimensions of a component are specified the surface quality is specified as well, though not necessarily over the entire surface. Surface quality is critical in contacting surfaces such as the faces of flanges that must mate to form a seal or sliders running in grooves. It is also important for resistance to fatigue crack initiation and for aesthetic reasons. The tolerance T on a dimension y is specified as y = 100 ± 0:1 mm, or as y = 50+0:01 −0:001 mm, indicating that there is more freedom to oversize than to undersize. Surface roughness is specified as an upper limit, for example, R &lt; 100 μm. The typical surface finish required in various products is shown in Table 13.3. The table also indicates typical processes that can achieve these levels of finish. Surface roughness is a measure of the irregularities of the surface (Figure 13.29). It is defined as the root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude of the surface profile: R2 =\n \n L\n \n 1∫ 2 y ðxÞdx L0\n \n (13.1)\n \n One way to measure it is to drag a light, sharp stylus over the surface in the x-direction while recording the vertical profile y(x), like playing a gramophone record. Optical profilometry, which is faster and more accurate, uses laser\n \n 401\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n Table 13.3 Levels of Finish\n \n y\n \n RMS roughness, R\n \n Finish, μm\n \n Process\n \n Typical Application\n \n R R R R R R\n \n Lapping Precision grind or lap Precision grinding Precision machining Machining Unfinished castings\n \n Mirrors High-quality bearings Cylinders, pistons, cams, bearings Gears, ordinary machine parts Light-loaded bearings, noncritical components Nonbearing surfaces\n \n = = = = = =\n \n 0.01 0.1 0.2–0.5 0.5–2 2–10 3–100\n \n Maximum roughness Mean surface\n \n x Microns\n \n 402\n \n L Millimeters\n \n interferometry to map surface irregularity. The tolerance T is obviously greater than 2R; indeed, since R is the root-mean-square roughness, the peak roughness, and hence the absolute lower limit for tolerance, is more like 5R. Real processes give tolerances that range from 10R to 1000R.\n \n Figures 13.30 and 13.31 show the characteristic ranges of tolerance and roughness of which processes are capable, retaining the color coding for material families. Data for finishing processes are added below the shaping processes. Sand casting gives rough surfaces; casting into metal dies gives smoother ones. No shaping processes for metals, however, do better than T = 0.1 mm and R = 0.5 μm. Machining, capable of high dimensional accuracy and surface finish, is commonly used after casting or deformation processing to bring the tolerance or finish up to the desired level, creating a process chain. Metals and ceramics can be surface-ground and lapped to a high precision and smoothness: A large telescope reflector has a tolerance approaching 5 μm and a roughness of about 1/100 of this over a dimension of a meter or more. But precision and finish carry a cost: Processing costs increase exponentially as the requirements for both are made more severe. It is an expensive mistake to overspecify precision and finish.\n \n FIGURE 13.29 A section through a surface showing its irregular surface (artistically exaggerated in the vertical direction). The irregularity is measured by the RMS roughness R.\n \n Molded polymers inherit the finish of the molds used to shape them and thus can be very smooth; machining to improve the finish is rarely necessary. Tolerances better than ± 0.2 mm are seldom possible because internal stresses left by molding cause distortion and because polymers creep in service. Joining: Material compatibility Processes for joining metals, polymers, ceramics, and glasses differ. A given adhesive will bond to some materials but not to others; welding methods for polymers differ from those for welding metals; and ceramics, which cannot be welded, are joined instead by diffusion bonding or glaze bonding. The process-material matrix (Figure 13.22) included four classes of joining process.\n \n Metal shaping\n \n Sand casting Die casting Investment casting Low-pressure casting Forging Extrusion Sheet forming Powder methods Electro-machining Conventional machining Injection molding Blow molding Compression molding Rotational molding Thermo-forming Polymer casting Resin-transfer molding Filament winding Lay-up methods Vacuum bag\n \n Composite shaping\n \n Polymer shaping\n \n Ceramic shaping\n \n 13.5 Systematic Process Selection\n \n Finishing\n \n 0.01\n \n 0.1 Tolerance (mm)\n \n 1\n \n 10\n \n Precision machining Grinding Lapping Polishing metal\n \n ceramic\n \n polymer\n \n composite\n \n FIGURE 13.30 The process-tolerance chart. The inclusion of finishing processes allows simple process chains to be explored.\n \n When the joint is between dissimilar materials, the process must be compatible with both. Adhesives and fasteners allow joints between different materials; many welding processes do not. If dissimilar metals are joined in such a way that they are in electrical contact, a corrosion couple appears if the joint is wet. This can be avoided by inserting an insulating layer between the surfaces. Thermal-expansion mismatch gives internal stresses in the joint if the temperature changes, with risk of distortion or damage. Identifying good practice in joining dissimilar materials is part of the documentation step. Joint geometry and mode of loading The geometry of the joint and the way it is loaded (Figure 13.32) influence process choice. Adhesive joints support shear but are poor in peeling—think of stripping off adhesive tape. Adhesives need a large working area—lap joints work well, butt joints do not. Rivets and staples, too, are well adapted for shear loading of lap joints but are less good in tension. Welds and threaded fasteners are more adaptable, but here, too, matching choice of process to geometry and loading is important.\n \n MFA, 09\n \n 403\n \n Metal shaping\n \n Polymer shaping\n \n Ceramic shaping\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Composite shaping\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n Sand casting Die casting Investment casting Low-pressure casting Forging Extrusion Sheet forming Powder methods Electro-machining Conventional machining Injection molding Blow molding Compression molding Rotational molding Thermo-forming Polymer casting Resin-transfer molding Filament winding Lay-up methods Vacuum bag 0.01\n \n Finishing\n \n 404\n \n 0.1\n \n 1 Roughness (μm)\n \n 10\n \n 100\n \n Precision machining Grinding Lapping Polishing metal\n \n ceramic\n \n polymer\n \n composite\n \n MFA, 09\n \n FIGURE 13.31 The process–surface roughness chart.

It may be required to conduct or insulate against the conduction of heat or electricity, or to operate at an elevated operating temperature. It may be permanent or have to be disassembled at the end of product life for recycling and reuse: Threaded fasteners and adhesives, loosened with solvents or heat, permit this. Surface treatment: Material compatibility Material process compatibility for surface treatments is shown at the bottom of the matrix in Figure 13.22. As noted previously, surface finishing is more important for metals than for polymers. The purpose of the surface treatment All surface treatment adds cost but the added value can be large. Table 13.4 illustrates the diversity of functions that surface treatments can provide. Some protect, some enhance performance, still others are primarily aesthetic. Protecting a component surface extends product life and increases the interval between maintenance cycles. Coatings on cutting tools enable faster cutting speeds and greater productivity. And surfacehardening processes may enable the substrate alloy to be replaced with a cheaper material—for example, a plain carbon steel with a hard carburized surface or a coating of hard titanium nitride (TiN) instead of a more expensive alloy steel. Secondary compatibilities Some surface treatments, such as anodizing, leave the dimensions, precision, and roughness of the surface unchanged. Electro- and vapor-deposited coatings change the dimensions a little, but may still leave a perfectly smooth surface. Polymer powder coating builds up a relatively thick, smooth layer; others, such as weld deposition, create a thick layer with a rough surface, requiring refinishing. “Line-of-sight” deposition processes coat only the surface at which they are directed, leaving inaccessible areas uncoated; others, with what is called “throwing power,” coat flat, curved, and reentrant surfaces equally well. Many surface treatment processes require heat. These can only be used on materials that can tolerate the rise in temperature. Some paints are applied cold, but many require a bake at up to 150°C. Heat treatments like carburizing or nitriding to give a hard surface layer require prolonged heating at temperatures up to 800°C, which can change the microstructure of the material being coated.

The rest is the cost of manufacture—that is, forming it to a shape and joining and finishing it. Before turning to details, there are four common-sense rules for minimizing cost that the designer should bear in mind, as follows. Keep things standard If someone already makes the part you want, it will almost certainly be cheaper to buy it than to make it. If nobody does, then it is cheaper to design it to be made from standard stock (sheet, rod, tube) than from nonstandard shapes or from special castings or forgings. Try to use standard materials, and as few of them as possible: This will reduce inventory costs and the range of tooling the manufacturer needs, and it can help with recycling. Keep things simple If a part has to be machined, it will have to be clamped; the cost increases with the number of times it will have to be rejigged or reoriented, especially if special tools are necessary. If a part is to be welded or brazed, the welder must be able to reach it with his torch and still see what he is doing. If it is to be cast or molded or forged, it should be remembered that high (and expensive) pressures are required to make fluids flow into narrow channels, and that reentrant shapes greatly complicate mold and die design. Think of making the part yourself: Will it be awkward? Could slight redesign make it less awkward? Make the parts easy to assemble Assembly takes time, and time is money. If the overhead rate is a mere $60 per hour, every minute of assembly time adds another $1 to the cost. Design for assembly (DFA) addresses this problem with a set of common-sense criteria and rules. Briefly, there are three: 1. Minimize part count. 2. Design parts to be self-aligning on assembly. 3. Use joining methods that are fast; snap fits and spot welds are faster than threaded fasteners or, usually, adhesives. Do not specify more performance than is needed Performance must be paid for. High-strength metals are more heavily alloyed with expensive additions; high-performance polymers are chemically more complex; highperformance ceramics require greater quality control in their manufacture. All of these increase material costs. In addition, high-strength materials are hard to fabricate. The forming pressures (whether for a metal or a polymer) are higher; tool wear is greater; ductility is usually less so that deformation processing can be difficult or impossible. This can mean that new processing routes must be used: investment casting or powder forming instead of conventional casting and mechanical working; more expensive molding equipment operating at higher temperatures and pressures; and so on. The better performance of the high-strength material must be paid for, not only in greater material cost but also in the higher cost of processing. Finally, there\n \n 13.6 Ranking: Process Cost\n \n are the questions of tolerance and roughness. Cost rises exponentially with demands for precision and surface finish. The message is clear. Performance costs money. Do not overspecify it. To make further progress, we must examine the contributions to process costs, and their origins. Economic criteria for selection If you have to sharpen a pencil, you can do it with a knife. If, instead, you had to sharpen a thousand pencils, it would pay to buy an electric sharpener. And if you had to sharpen a million, you might wish to equip yourself with an automatic feeding, gripping, and sharpening system. To cope with pencils of different length and diameter, you could go further and devise a microprocessor-controlled system with sensors to measure pencil dimensions, sharpening pressure, and so on —an “intelligent” system that can recognize and adapt to pencil size. The choice of process, then, depends on the number of pencils you wish to sharpen, that is, on the batch size. The best choice is the one that costs the least per pencil sharpened. Figure 13.33 is a schematic of how the cost of sharpening a pencil might vary with batch size. A knife does not cost much but it is slow, so the labor\n \n Relative cost per pencil\n \n 104\n \n Prototype\n \n Small batch\n \n Mass production\n \n Large batch\n \n 102\n \n Knife 1 Electric Automatic Intelligent 0.1 1\n \n MFA, 09\n \n 102 Knife cheapest\n \n 104 Number of pencils Electric cheapest\n \n Automatic cheapest\n \n 106\n \n 108 Intelligent cheapest\n \n FIGURE 13.33 The cost of sharpening a pencil plotted against batch size for four processes. The curves all have the form of Equation (13.5).\n \n 407\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n cost is high. The other processes involve progressively greater capital investment but do the job more quickly, reducing labor costs. The balance between capital cost and rate gives the shape of the curves. In this figure the best choice is the lowest curve—a knife for up to 100 pencils; an electric sharpener for 102 to 104, an automatic system for 104 to 106, and so on. Each process has an economic batch size.\n \n Metal shaping\n \n Ceramic shaping\n \n Economic batch size Process cost depends on a large number of independent variables, not all within the control of the modeler. Cost modeling is described in the next section, but—given the disheartening implications of the last sentence—it is comforting to have an alternative, if approximate, way out. The economic batch size provides it. Values for the processes described in this chapter are shown in Figure 13.34. A process with an economic batch size with the range B 1 –B 2 is one that is found by experience to be competitive in cost when the output lies in that range, just as the electric sharpener was economic in the range 10 2 to 10 4. The economic batch size is commonly cited for processes. The easy way to introduce economy into the selection is to rank candidate processes by economic batch size and retain those that are economic in the range you want. But do not harbor false illusions: Many variables cannot be rolled into one without loss of discrimination. A cost model gives deeper insight.\n \n Polymer shaping\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Composite shaping\n \n 408\n \n Sand casting Die casting Investment casting Low-pressure casting Forging Extrusion Sheet forming Powder methods Electro-machining Conventional machining Injection molding Blow molding Compression molding Rotational molding Thermo-forming Polymer casting Resin-transfer molding Filament winding Lay-up methods Vacuum bag 1\n \n 10 metal\n \n FIGURE 13.34 The economic batch size chart.\n \n 102 103 104 105 Economic batch size (units) ceramic\n \n polymer\n \n composite\n \n 106\n \n 107 MFA, 09\n \n 13.6 Ranking: Process Cost\n \n Cost modeling The manufacture of a component consumes resources (Figure 13.35), each of which has an associated cost. The final cost is the sum of expenses of all of the resources it consumes (detailed in Table 13.5). Thus the cost of producing a component of mass m entails the cost Cm ($/kg) of the materials and feedstocks from which it is made. It involves the cost of dedicated tooling Ct ($) and that of the capital equipment Cc ($) in which the tooling will be used. It requires time, chargeable at an overhead rate C_ oh (thus with units of $/hr), in which we include the cost of labor, administration, and general plant costs. It requires energy, which is sometimes charged against a process step if it is very energy intense but more commonly is treated as part of the overhead and lumped into C ̇ oh , as we shall do here. Finally there is the cost of information, meaning research and development, royalty or license fees; this, too, we view as a cost per unit time and lump it into the overhead. Think now of the manufacture of a component (the “unit of output”) weighing m kg, made of a material costing C m $/kg. The first contribution to the unit cost is that of the material mCm magnified by the factor 1/(1−f ) where f is the scrap fraction—the fraction of the starting material that ends up as sprues, risers, turnings, rejects, or waste: C1 =\n \n mCm ð1−f Þ\n \n (13.2)\n \n The cost Ct of a set of tooling—dies, molds, fixtures, and jigs—is what is called a dedicated cost: one that must be wholly assigned to the production run of this single component.

Tooling wears out. If the run is a long one, replacement will be necessary. Thus tooling cost per unit takes the form   Ct n C2 = Int + 0:51 (13.3) n nt where nt is the number of units that a set of tooling can make before it has to be replaced, and Int is the integer function. The term in curly brackets simply increments the tooling cost by that of one tool set every time n exceeds nt. The capital cost of equipment Cc, by contrast, is rarely dedicated. A given piece of equipment—a powder press, for example—can be used to make many different components by installing different die-sets or tooling. It is usual to convert the capital cost of nondedicated equipment, and the cost of borrowing the capital itself, into an overhead by dividing it by a capital write-off time two (five years, say) over which it is to be recovered. The quantity Cc/two is then a cost per hour—provided the equipment is used continuously. That is rarely the case, so the term is modified by dividing it by a load factor L—the fraction of time for which the equipment is productive. The cost per unit is then this hourly cost divided by the rate n ̇ at which units are produced:   1 Cc C3 = n_ Ltwo\n \n (13.4)\n \n Finally there is the overhead rate C_ oh . It becomes a cost per unit when divided by the production rate n ̇ units per hour (averaged over the production run to allow for downtime): C4 =\n \n C_ oh n_\n \n (13.5)\n \n The total shaping cost per part is the sum of these four terms, taking the form     mCm Ct Cc n 1 _ C= + Int + 0:51 + + C oh n_ Ltwo ð1−f Þ n nt\n \n (13.6)\n \n The equation says: The cost has three essential contributions—a material cost per unit of production that is independent of batch size and rate, a dedicated cost per unit of production that varies as the reciprocal of the production volume (1/n), and a gross overhead per unit of production that varies as the reciprocal of the production rate ð1/n_ Þ. The equation describes a set of curves relating cost C to batch size n, one for each process. Each has the shape of the pencil-sharpening curves of Figure 13.33. The use of the model is illustrated more fully in the case studies of Chapter 14.\n \n 13.7 Computer-Aided Process Selection\n \n Technical cost modeling Equation (13.6) is the first step in modeling cost. Greater predictive power is possible with technical cost models that exploit understanding of the way in which the design, the process, and cost interact. The capital cost of equipment depends on size and degree of automation. Tooling cost and production rate depend on complexity. These and many other dependencies can be captured in theoretical or empirical formulae or look-up tables that can be built into the cost model, giving more resolution in ranking competing processes. For more advanced analyses the reader is referred to the literature listed in “Further reading,” at the end of this chapter.\n \n 13.7 COMPUTER-AIDED PROCESS SELECTION Screening If process attributes are stored in a database with an appropriate user interface, selection charts can be created and selection boxes manipulated with much greater freedom. The CES platform, mentioned earlier, is an example of such a system. The database contains records, each describing the attributes of a single process. Example 13.1 shows part of a typical record: that for injection molding. A schematic indicates how the process works; it is supported by a short description. This is followed by a list of attributes: the shapes it can make, the attributes relating to shape and physical characteristics, and those that describe economic parameters; ending with brief documentation in the form of guidelines, technical notes, and typical uses. The numeric attributes are stored as ranges, indicating the range of capability of the process. Each record is linked to records for the materials with which it is compatible, allowing choice of material to be used as a screening criterion, like the material compatibility matrix of Figure 13.22 but with greater resolution. A short list of candidates is extracted in two steps: screening to eliminate processes that cannot meet the design specification, and ranking to order the survivors by economic criteria.\n \n EXAMPLE 13.1 Injection Molding The Process The most widely used process for shaping thermoplastics is the reciprocating screw injection molding machine, shown in the diagram on the right. Polymer granules are fed into a spiral press where they are heated, mixed, and softened to a dough-like consistency that is forced through one or more channels (“sprues”) into the die. The polymer solidifies under pressure and the component is then ejected.\n \n Mold\n \n Granular Polymer Nozzle Cylinder\n \n Heater\n \n Screw\n \n 411\n \n 412\n \n CHAPTER 13:\n \n Processes and Process Selection\n \n Thermoplastics, thermosets, and elastomers can also be injection molded. Co-injection allows molding of components with different materials, colors, and features. Injection foam molding allows economical production of large molded components by using inert gas or chemical blowing agents to make components that have a solid skin and a cellular inner structure.\n \n Shapes Circular prismatic Noncircular prismatic Solid 3D Hollow 3D\n \n ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓\n \n Physical Attributes Mass range Range of section thickness Tolerance Roughness Surface roughness (A = v. smooth)\n \n 0.01–25 kg 0.4–6.3 mm 0.2–1 mm 0.2–1.6 μm A\n \n Economic Attributes Economic batch size (units)\n \n 104–106\n \n Cost Modeling Capital cost Material utilization fraction Production rate (units) Tooling cost Tool life (units)\n \n 3 × 104–7 × 105 USD 0.6–0.9 60–1000/hr 3000–30,000 USD 104–106\n \n Documentation Design Guidelines Injection molding is the best way to mass-produce small, precise polymer components with complex shapes. The surface finish is good; texture and pattern can be easily altered in the tool; and fine detail reproduces well. Decorative labels can be molded onto the surface of the component. The only finishing operation is the removal of the sprue. Technical Notes Most thermoplastics can be injection molded, although those with high melting temperatures (e.g., PTFE) are difficult. Thermoplastic-based composites (short-fiber and particulate filled) can be processed providing the filler-loading is not too large. Large changes in section area are not recommended. Small reentrant angles and complex shapes are possible, though some features (e.g., undercuts, screw threads, inserts) may result in increased tooling costs. Typical Uses Housings, containers, covers, knobs, tool handles, plumbing fittings, lenses, toys, and so on.\n \n To enable this, the cost model described in Section 13.6 is implemented in the CES software. The records contain approximate data for the ranges of capital and tooling costs (C c and Ct) and for the rate of production (n_ ). Equation (13.6) contains other parameters not listed in the record because they are not attributes of the process itself but depend on the design, or the material, or the economics (and thus the location) of the plant in which the processing will be done. The user must provide this information, conveniently\n \n 13.9 Further Reading\n \n entered through a dialog box. The output is a plot of cost against batch size, like that shown earlier in Figure 13.33. More information about computer-aided selection can be found in the sources listed under Granta Design (2010) in “Further reading.”\n \n 13.8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS A wide range of shaping, joining, and finishing processes is available to the design engineer. Each has certain characteristics, which, taken together, suit it to the processing of certain materials in certain shapes, but disqualify it for others. Faced with the choice, the designer in the past, relied on locally available expertise or on common practice. Neither of these leads to innovation, nor are they well matched to current design methods. The structured, systematic approach of this chapter provides a way forward. It ensures that potentially interesting processes are not overlooked, and guides the user quickly to processes capable of achieving the desired requirements. The method parallels that for selection of material, using process selection matrices and charts to implement the procedure. A component design dictates a certain, known combination of process attributes. These design requirements are plotted onto the charts, identifying a subset of possible processes. The method lends itself to computer implementation, allowing selection from a large portfolio of processes by screening on attributes and ranking by economic criteria. There is, of course, much more to process selection than this. It is to be seen, rather, as a first systematic step, replacing a total reliance on local experience and past practice. The narrowing of choice helps considerably: It is now much easier to identify the right source for more expert knowledge and to ask it the right questions. But the final choice still depends on local economic and organizational factors that can only be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n \n 13.9 FURTHER READING ASM Handbook Series (1971–2004).

The inputs are design requirements; the output is a shortlist of processes capable of meeting them. Where processes compete, a ranking is made possible by a cost model. The case studies in this chapter illustrate the method. The first four make use of hard-copy charts; the last two show how computer-based selection works. The case studies follow a standard pattern. First, we list the design requirements: material, shape, size, minimum section, precision, and finish. Then we plot these requirements onto the process matrices, identifying search areas. The processes that lie within the search areas are capable of making the component to its design specification: They are the candidates. If no one process meets all the design requirements, then processes have to be “stacked”: casting followed by machining (to meet the tolerance specification on one surface, for instance); or powder methods followed by grinding. More details for the most promising are then sought, starting with the data sources listed under “Further reading” and in the more comprehensive compilation of Appendix D. The final choice evolves from this subset, taking into account local factors, often specific to a particular company, geographical area, or country.\n \n 14.2 CASTING AN ALUMINUM CON-ROD Connecting rods link oscillatory motion to rotary motion in IC engines, and rotary to oscillatory motion in pumps. Here we explore competing processes for casting a small aluminum alloy connecting rod (Figure 14.1), using the cost model of Chapter 13 to distinguish between them. The design requirements The con-rod is a solid 3D shape to be made of a nonferrous alloy. The dimensions of the con-rod are such that its mass is about 0.3 kg and its minimum section 8 mm. The precision and tolerance of the casting are not critical since the bores and their faces will have to be machined to give the required precision. A batch size of 100,000 is envisaged. Table 14.1 summarizes the requirements.\n \n ∅14 ± 0.02\n \n 28 ± 0.25 8 ± 0.25\n \n ∅18 ± 0.02\n \n FIGURE 14.1 A connecting rod.

All will require a subsequent machining operation.\n \n The selection The constraints are plotted on the process matrices and charts in Figures 14.4 through 14.10 in the chapter. The material, the shape, and the required batch size eliminate most of the processes listed on them, leaving three casting processes and machining from solid as options. Machining is rejected on the grounds of material wastage; retained are sand casting, die casting, and low-pressure casting (Table 14.2). More insight is given by examining their relative cost, using the model of Equation (13.6). The relevant data are assembled in Table 14.3, in which all costs all are normalized by the material cost, the term mC m /(1 − f ). The results are plotted in Figure 14.2 as unit cost C versus batch size n curves, following the example in Figure 13.33. At small batch sizes the unit cost is dominated by the “fixed” costs of tooling (the second term on the right of Equation (13.6)). As the batch size n increases, this contribution falls (provided, of course, that the tooling has a life that is greater than n) until it flattens out at a value that is dominated by the “variable” costs of material, labor, and other overheads.  ̇ Competing processes usually differ in tooling cost Ct and production rate n, causing their C – n curves to intersect, as they do here. Sand-casting equipment is inexpensive but the process is slow. The cost of molds for low-pressure casting is greater than for sand casting, and the process is a little faster. Die-casting equipment costs much more but it is also much\n \n 417\n \n CHAPTER 14:\n \n Case Studies: Process Selection\n \n Table 14.3 Data for the Cost Equation for the Processes in Table 14.2 Relative Cost*\n \n Sand Casting\n \n Die Casting\n \n Low-pressure Casting\n \n Material, mCm/(1 − f ) Basic overhead C ̇ oh (hr−1) Capital write-off time two (yrs) Load factor\n \n 1 10\n \n 1 10\n \n 1 10\n \n 5 0.5\n \n 5 0.5\n \n 5 0.5\n \n Dedicated tool cost, Ct Capital cost, Cc Batch rate, n ̇ (hr−1)\n \n 210 1800 3\n \n 16,000 30,000 50\n \n 2,000 8,000 10\n \n Tool life, nt (number of units)\n \n 200,000\n \n 1,000,000\n \n 500,000\n \n Comment\n \n Process-independent parameters\n \n Process-dependent parameters\n \n * All costs normalized to the material cost.\n \n 104\n \n Casting processes\n \n Tooling costs dominate\n \n Relative cost per component\n \n 418\n \n 103\n \n Die casting Low-pressure casting\n \n 102\n \n 10\n \n Material and time costs dominate\n \n Sand casting\n \n 1 Material cost 0.1\n \n mCm (1− f )\n \n MFA, 09\n \n 1\n \n 10\n \n Sand casting cheapest\n \n 102 103 104 Number of components\n \n Low-pressure casting cheapest\n \n 105\n \n 106\n \n Die casting cheapest\n \n FIGURE 14.2 The relative cost of casting the con-rod as a function of the production run. The costs are normalized by the cost of the material.\n \n 14.3 Forming a Fan\n \n faster. The material cost, the labor cost per hour, and the capital write-off time are taken to be the same for all. The curves for sand, low-pressure, and die casting intersect at a batch size of 200: Below this, sand casting is the more economical. Low-pressure casting becomes marginally less expensive than the others for batches of between 200 and 8000, above which die casting becomes the most economic choice. The best choice for a batch size of 100,000 is die casting. Note that, for small batches, the component cost is dominated by that of the tooling—the material cost hardly matters. But as the batch size grows, the contribution of the second term in the cost equation diminishes; and if the process is fast, the unit cost falls until it is typically about three times that of the material of which the component is made. Postscript There are other issues of quality besides precision and smoothness that enter into the choice of process. Sand castings tend to trap bubbles and inclusions that act as starting points for fatigue cracks in a cyclically loaded component like a con-rod. Some low-pressure–casting techniques smooth the flow of liquid metal into the die, reducing defect content. Die casting uses higher pressures, and generally gives the highest-quality casting. Considerations such as these can shift the economic switch-points, expanding the economic batch range of the process that offers the highest quality.\n \n 14.3 FORMING A FAN Fans for vacuum cleaners (Figure 14.3) are designed to be cheap, quiet, and efficient, probably in that order. The key to minimizing process costs is to form the fan to its final shape in a single operation, leaving only the central hub to be machined to fit the shaft with which it mates. This means the selection of a single process that can meet the specifications for precision and tolerance, avoiding the need for machining or finishing of the disk or blades. The design requirements Nylon is the material of choice for the fan. The pumping rate of a fan is determined by its rate of revolution and its size. The designer calculates the need for a fan of radius 60 mm, with 12 profiled blades of average thickness 4 mm. The volume of material in the fan is, roughly, its surface area times its thickness—about 10−4 m3—giving (when multiplied by the density of nylon, 1100 kg/m3) a weight in the range 0.1 to 0.15 kg. The fan has a fairly complex shape, although its high symmetry simplifies it somewhat. We classify it as 3D solid. In the designer’s view, balance and surface smoothness are what really matter. They (and the geometry) determine the pumping efficiency of the fan and influence the noise it makes. The designer specifies a tolerance of ± 0.5 mm and a surface roughness of ≤ 1 μm. A production run of 10,000 fans is planned.\n \n 419\n \n 420\n \n CHAPTER 14:\n \n Case Studies: Process Selection\n \n Surface roughness critical\n \n 60 mm\n \n FIGURE 14.3 A fan.

What processes can meet them? The selection We turn first to the material-process and shape-process matrices (Figures 14.4 and 14.5) on which selection boxes have been drawn. The intersection of the two leaves five classes of shaping process—those boxed in the second figure. Screening on mass and section thickness (Figures 14.6 and 14.7) eliminates polymer casting and RTM, leaving the other three. The constraints on tolerance and roughness are upper limits only (Figures 14.8 and 14.9); all three process classes survive. The planned batch size of 10,000 plotted on the economic batch-size chart (Figure 14.10) eliminates machining from solid. The surviving processes are listed in Table 14.5.\n \n Shaping\n \n Sand casting Die casting Investment casting Low-pressure casting Forging Extrusion Sheet forming Powder methods Electro-machining Conventional machining Injection molding Blow molding Compression molding Rotational molding Thermo-forming Polymer casting Resin-transfer molding Filament winding Lay-up methods Vacuum bag\n \n Joining\n \n Adhesives Welding, metals Welding, polymers Fasteners\n \n Finishing\n \n Precision machining Grinding Lapping Polishing Conrod\n \n os ites\n \n foa ms\n \n Co mp\n \n er Po lym\n \n rm os ets\n \n Th e\n \n rm op las tics Th e\n \n ers sto m Ela\n \n Gla sse s\n \n ram ics\n \n on fer rou s\n \n Ce\n \n tals ,n\n \n Me\n \n Me ta\n \n ls,\n \n fer rou s\n \n 14.3 Forming a Fan\n \n Conrod\n \n Insulator Fan\n \n metal\n \n ceramic\n \n polymer\n \n foam\n \n composite\n \n MFA, 09\n \n FIGURE 14.4 The process–material compatibility matrix, showing the requirements of the case studies.

Figure 14.11 shows the resulting cost curves. The tooling for compression molding is less expensive than that for injection molding, but it is slower because, by using multiple die cavities, injection 1\n \n Data from the records in the CES software for these processes.\n \n 14.4 Spark Plug Insulators\n \n molding can produce several units in one shot. This makes the two curves intersect at about 10,000 units: Below, compression molding is the less expensive; above, it is injection molding. Postscript There are (as always) other considerations—the questions of capital investment, local skills, overhead rate, and so forth. The charts cannot answer these. But the procedure has been helpful in narrowing the choice, suggesting alternatives, and providing a background against which a final selection can be made. Related case studies 6.6 “Materials for flywheels” 14.2 “Casting an aluminum con-rod”\n \n 14.4 SPARK PLUG INSULATORS The difficulties of using hard-copy charts for process selection will, by now, be obvious: The charts have limited resolution and are clumsy to use. They give a helpful overview but they are not the way to get a definitive selection. Computer-based methods overcome both problems. The CES system, which builds on the methods in Chapter 5, was described earlier. It allows limits to be set on material, shape, mass, section, tolerance, and surface roughness, delivering the subset of processes that meet all the limits. The economics are then examined by plotting the desired batch size on a bar chart of economic batch size, or by implementing the cost model that is built into the software. If the requirements are very demanding, no single process can meet them all. Then the procedure is to relax the most demanding of them (often tolerance and surface roughness), seeking processes that can meet the others. A second process is then sought to add the desired refinement. The next two case studies show how the method works. The design requirements The anatomy of a spark plug is sketched in Figure 14.12. It is an assembly of components, one of which is the insulator. This is to be made of a ceramic, alumina, with the shape shown in the figure: an axisymmetric, hollow, stepped shape. It weighs about 0.05 kg and has a minimum section of 1.2 mm. Precision is important, since the insulator is part of an assembly; the design specifies a precision of ± 0.3 mm and a surface finish of better than 10 μm. The insulators are to be made in large numbers: The projected batch size is 100,000. Cost should be as low as possible. Table 14.7 summarizes the requirements.\n \n 429\n \n 430\n \n CHAPTER 14:\n \n Case Studies: Process Selection\n \n FIGURE 14.12 A spark plug.

Only one process family survives: powder methods. The required batch size of 100,000 lies within its economic range (refer to Figure 14.6). The family of powder methods is a large one, including die pressing and sintering, hot pressing, powder extrusion, powder injection molding, hot isostatic pressing, and spray deposition. These (and others) could be added to the charts, but to do so makes them cumbersome. It is better to manage the information in a computer-based environment. The CES system does this. Applying the constraints listed in Table 14.7 eliminates all but two of the processes in its database: die pressing and sintering and powder injection molding (PIM: the shaping of a powder by mixing it with a polymer binder, molding, then burning off the binder during the subsequent sintering). The same system implements the cost model that was described in Chapter 13.\n \n 14.5 A Manifold Jacket\n \n Powder injection molding\n \n User-defined inputs Material cost = 9.5 $/kg Part mass = 0.05 kg Overhead rate = $100/hr Capital write-off time = 5 years Load factor = 0.5\n \n Relative cost per unit\n \n 104\n \n 103\n \n 102\n \n 10\n \n 1 1\n \n 10\n \n 102\n \n 103\n \n 104 105 Batch size n\n \n 106\n \n 107\n \n 108\n \n 109\n \n FIGURE 14.13 The unit cost as a function batch size for powder-injection molding of a small insulator.

The unit cost, high at low batch sizes, falls to about twice that of the material at batch sizes above about 10,000. Postscript Insulators are made commercially by PIM. Economics, for a mass-produced product like this, are critical—pennies count. Technical cost modeling, described before in Chapter 13, can guide the choice of the best equipment and optimum operating conditions to minimize cost.

The minimum section thickness is between 2 and 5 mm. The requirements for precision and surface finish are severe (tolerance &lt; ± 0.1 mm, roughness &lt; 20 μm). Because of its limited application, only 20 units are to be made. Table 14.8 lists the requirements. The charts cannot give much guidance in selecting processes to make such a complex component. We turn instead to computer-aided selection. The selection The constraints are applied by entering them in a limit-selection dialog box like that in Figure 5.12 (left). The material constraint (nickel) and the shape constraint (3D hollow) eliminate a large number of processes. Figure 14.15 shows 15 that survive. The subsequent constraints on mass and section thickness eliminate more, leaving only the six that remain in color in the figure. Applying the severe constraints on tolerance and surface roughness eliminates all but one: electroforming. The required batch size lies within its range. Postscript A search for further information in the sources listed in Appendix D reveals that electroforming of nickel is an established practice and that components as large as 20 kg are routinely made by this process.

The task is to choose a joining process for the seams between the sheets. The design requirements The process must be compatible with the material, here low carbon steel sheet of thickness 1.5 mm. The lap joints carry only low loads in service but handling during installation may impose tension and shear. They must conduct heat, be watertight, and able to tolerate temperatures up to 100°C. There is no need for the joints to be disassembled for recycling at the end of life since the whole thing is steel. Table 14.9 summarizes the translation. The selection The CES system has records and attributes for 52 joining processes. Applying the material constraint leaves 32 of them—those eliminated are polymer specific or composite specific. Further screening on joint geometry, mode of loading, and section thickness reduces the list to 20. The requirement to conduct heat reduces this further to 12. Water resistance and operating temperature do not change the shortlist further. The processes passing the screening stage are listed in Table 14.10.\n \n 433\n \n 434\n \n CHAPTER 14:\n \n Case Studies: Process Selection\n \n FIGURE 14.16 A section through a domestic radiator.

This reveals that explosive welding requires special facilities and permits (hardly a surprise). Electron and laser welding require expensive equipment, so use of a shared facility might be necessary to make them economic. Resistance spot welding is screened out because it failed the requirement to be watertight, although that requirement only applies to the edge seams. Quality constraints are not severe, but distortion and residual stress will make fit-up of adjacent joints difficult. Low carbon steels are readily weldable, so it is unlikely that welding will cause cracking or embrittlement—but this can be checked by seeking documentation.\n \n 14.7 SURFACE-HARDENING A BALL-BEARING RACE The balls of ball races run along grooved tracks (Figure 14.17). The life of a ball race is limited by wear and fatigue. Both are suppressed by using hard materials. Hard materials, however, are not tough, incurring the risk that shock loading or mishandling might cause the race to fracture. The design requirements The solution is to use an alloy steel, which has excellent bulk properties, and to apply a separate surface treatment to increase hardness where it matters. We therefore seek processes to surfaceharden alloy steels for wear and fatigue resistance. The precision of both balls and race is critical, so the process must not compromise the dimensions or the surface smoothness. Table 14.11 summarizes the translation. The selection The CES system contains records for 46 surface treatment processes. Many are compatible with alloy steels. More discriminating is the purpose of the treatment—to impart fatigue and wear resistance—reducing the list to 8. Imposing the requirement for a very smooth surface knocks out processes that coat or deform the surface because these compromise the finish. Adding the further constraint that the curved surface coverage must be good or very good leaves just five, listed in Table 14.12. The records for these describe and illustrate the process, and summarize their typical uses.\n \n Inner race\n \n Cage\n \n Hardened track\n \n Ball\n \n Outer race\n \n FIGURE 14.17 A section through a ball race.

Documentation in the records gives details.\n \n Postscript To get further we seek documentation for these processes. The hardness of the surface and the depth of the hardened layer depend on process variables: the time and temperature of the treatment and the composition of the steel in ways that are tabulated. And economics, of course, enters the equation. Ball races are made in enormous numbers and while their sizes vary, their geometry does not. This is where dedicated equipment, even if very expensive, is viable.\n \n 14.8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Process selection, at first sight, looks like a black art: The initiated know; the rest of the world cannot even guess how they do it. But this—as the chapter demonstrates—is not really so. The systematic approach, developed in Chapter 13, and illustrated here, identifies a subset of viable processes using design information only: size, shape, complexity, precision, roughness, and material—itself chosen by the systematic methods in Chapter 5. It does not identify the single, best choice; that depends on too many case-specific considerations. But, by identifying candidates, it directs the user to data sources (starting with those listed in Appendix D) that provide the details needed to make a final selection.\n \n CHAPTER 15\n \n Materials and the Environment\n \n CONTENTS 15.1 Introduction and Synopsis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 438 15.2 The Material Life-Cycle . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 438 15.3 Material and Energy-Consuming Systems . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 440 15.4 The Eco-Attributes of Materials. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 442 Material production: Energy and emissions. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 442 Estimates for material processing energies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 443 End of life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 445\n \n 15.5 Eco-Selection . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 447 15.6 Case Studies: Drink Containers and Crash Barriers . . . . . . . . 453 The energy content of containers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 453 Crash barriers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 454\n \n 15.7 Summary and Conclusions. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 457 15.8 Further Reading. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 458 Materials Selection in Mechanical Design.

The environment has some capacity to cope with this so that a certain level of impact can be absorbed without lasting damage. But it is clear that current human activities exceed this threshold with increasing frequency, diminishing the quality of the world in which we now live and threatening the well-being of future generations. The manufacture and use of products, with their associated consumption of materials and energy, are among the culprits. The position is dramatized by the following statement: At a global growth rate of 3% per year we will mine, process, and dispose of more “stuff” in the next 25 years than in the entire industrial history of mankind. Design for the environment is generally interpreted as the effort to adjust our present design methods to correct known, measurable, environmental degradation; the time scale of this thinking is 10 years or so, an average product’s expected life. Design for sustainability is the longer view: that of adaptation to a lifestyle that meets present needs without compromising the needs of future generations. The time scale here is less clear—it is measured in decades or centuries— and the adaptation required is much greater. This chapter focuses on the role of materials and processes in achieving design for the environment. Sustainability requires social and political changes that are beyond the scope of this book. The ideas in this chapter are developed further in the text that appears as the first entry in “Further reading.”\n \n 15.2 THE MATERIAL LIFE-CYCLE The nature of the problem is brought into focus by examining the material life-cycle shown in the sketch in Figure 15.1. Ore and feedstock, most of them nonrenewable, are processed to give materials; these are manufactured into products that are used and, at the end of their lives, disposed of, a fraction perhaps entering a recycling loop, the rest committed to incineration or landfill. Energy and materials are consumed at each point in this cycle (we shall call them “phases”), with an associated penalty of CO2 and other emissions—heat and gaseous, liquid, and solid waste. The problem, crudely put, is that the sum of these unwanted by-products now often exceeds the capacity of the environment to absorb them. Some of the injury is local in scale and its origins can be traced and remedial action taken. For some the scale is national, for others it is global, and here remedial action has wider social and organizational prerequisites. Much present environmental legislation aims at modest reductions in the damaging\n \n 15.2 The Material Life-Cycle\n \n EN E R G Y\n \n Energy\n \n FE ED S\n \n E N E R GY\n \n TO CK\n \n TRANSPORT\n \n Resources\n \n FE\n \n ED\n \n ST\n \n OC\n \n K\n \n Feedstocks TRANSPORT\n \n TRANSPORT\n \n Transport OC K\n \n E N E RGY\n \n Product manufacture\n \n ED ST\n \n E N E RGY\n \n FE\n \n TRANSPORT\n \n Natural resources\n \n Material production\n \n Product use\n \n TRANSPORT\n \n Emissions\n \n Product disposal\n \n CO2, NOx, SOx Particulates Toxic waste Low-grade heat\n \n FIGURE 15.1 The material life-cycle.

Energy and materials are consumed in each phase, generating waste heat and solid, liquid, and gaseous emissions.\n \n activity; a regulation requiring a 20% reduction in—say—the average gasoline consumption of passenger cars is seen by car makers as a major challenge. Sustainability requires solutions of a completely different kind. Even conservative estimates of the adjustment needed to restore long-term equilibrium with the environment envisage a reduction in the flows of Figure 15.1 by a factor of four or more. Population growth and the growth of the expectations of this population more than cancel any modest savings that the developed nations may achieve. It is here that the challenge is greatest, requiring difficult adaptation; it is one for which no generally agreed-on solutions yet exist. But it remains the long-term driver of eco-design, to be retained as background to any creative thinking.\n \n 439\n \n 440\n \n CHAPTER 15:\n \n Materials and the Environment\n \n 15.3 MATERIAL AND ENERGY-CONSUMING SYSTEMS It would seem that the obvious ways to conserve materials are to make products smaller, make them last longer, and recycle them when they finally reach the end of their lives. But the seemingly obvious can sometimes be deceptive. Materials and energy form part of a complex and highly interactive system, as illustrated in Figure 15.2. Here primary catalysts of consumption such as new technology, planned obsolescence, increasing wealth, education, and population growth influence aspects of product use and through these the consumption of materials and energy and the by-products that these produce. The connecting lines indicate influences; a green line suggests positive, broadly desirable influence; a red line suggests negative, undesirable influence; and red-green suggests that the driver has the capacity for both positive and negative influence. The diagram brings out the complexity. Follow, for instance the lines of influence of new technology and its consequences. It offers more material and energy-efficient products, but by also offering new functionality it creates obsolescence and the desire to replace a product that has useful life left in it. Electronic products are prime examples of this: Most are discarded while Miniaturization\n \n Growing population New functionality Increasing wealth\n \n New technology\n \n Material consumption\n \n Greater recycling\n \n Energy consumption\n \n Greater material wants\n \n Increasing education\n \n Longer life Planned obsolescence\n \n Greater quality of life\n \n Industrial design Generally positive influence Generally negative influence Both positive and negative influence\n \n FIGURE 15.2 The influences on consumption of materials and energy. It is essential to see eco-design as a systems problem, not solved by simply choosing “good” and avoiding “bad” materials but rather by matching the material to the system requirements.\n \n 15.3 Material and Energy-Consuming Systems\n \n still functional. And observe, even at this simple level, the consequences of longer life—a seemingly obvious measure. It can certainly help to conserve materials (a positive influence) but, in an era in which new technology delivers more energy-efficient products (particularly cars, electronics, and household appliances today), extending the life of old products can have a negative influence on energy consumption. As a final example, consider the bivalent influence of industrial design—the subject of Chapter 16. The lasting designs of the past are evidence of industry’s ability to create products that are treasured and conserved. But today industrial design is frequently used as a potent tool to stimulate consumption by deliberate obsolescence, creating the perception that “new” is desirable and that even slightly “old” is unappealing. The use patterns of products Table 15.1 suggests a matrix of product use patterns. Those in the first row require energy to perform their primary function. Those in the second could function without energy but, for reasons of comfort, convenience, or safety, consume energy to provide a secondary function. Those in the third row provide their primary function without any need for energy other than human effort. The load factor across the top is an approximate indicator of the intensity of use—one that will, of course, vary widely. The choice of materials and processes influences all the phases of Figure 15.1: production, through the drainage of resources and the undesired by-products of refinement; manufacture, through the level of efficiency and cleanness of the shaping, joining, and finishing processes; use, through the ability to conserve energy through lightweight design, higher thermal efficiency, and lower energy consumption; and finally disposal through a greater ability to allow reuse, disassembly, and recycling.\n \n Table 15.1 Use Matrix of Product Classes\n \n Primary powerconsuming Secondary powerconsuming Nonpowerconsuming\n \n High Load Factor\n \n Modest Load P Factor\n \n Family car Train set Aircraft Housing (heat, light)\n \n Television Freezer\n \n Bridges Roads\n \n Furniture Bicycle\n \n Parking lot (light)\n \n High impact\n \n Low Load Factor Coffee maker Vacuum cleaner Washing machine Household dishes Clothing (washing) Canoe Tent\n \n Low impact\n \n Energy intense\n \n Material intense\n \n 441\n \n Materials and the Environment\n \n Civil aircraft\n \n Family car\n \n Appliance (refrigerator)\n \n Mat.

Simplifying for a moment, let us take energy consumption as a measure of both the inputs and undesired by-products of each phase and use it for a character appraisal of use sectors. Figure 15.3 presents the evidence, using this measure. It has two significant features, with important implications. The first feature is that one phase almost always dominates, accounting for 80% or more of the energy, sometimes much more. If large changes are to be achieved, it is this phase that must be the target; a reduction by a factor of 2, even of 10, in any other makes little significant difference to the total. The second feature: When differences are as great as those of Figure 15.3, precision is not the issue—an error of a factor of 2 changes very little. It is the nature of people who measure things to wish to do so with precision, and precise data must be the ultimate goal. But it is possible to move forward without precision: Precise judgments can be drawn from imprecise data. This is an important consideration: Much information about eco-attributes is imprecise.\n \n 15.4 THE ECO-ATTRIBUTES OF MATERIALS Material production: Energy and emissions Most of the energy consumed in the four phases of Figure 15.1 is derived from fossil fuels. Some is consumed in that state—as gas, oil, coal, or coke. Much is first converted to electricity at a European average conversion\n \n 15.4 The Eco-Attributes of Materials\n \n efficiency of about 38%. Not all electricity is generated from fossil fuels— there are contributions from hydroelectric, nuclear, and wind/wave sources. But with the exception of Norway (70% hydro) and France (80% nuclear), the predominant energy sources are fossil fuels; and since the national grids of European countries are linked, with power flowing from one to another as needed, it is adequate here to think of a European average fossil-fuel energy per kilowatt of delivered electrical power. The fossil-fuel energy consumed in making one kilogram of material is called its embodied energy. Some of the energy is stored in the created material and can be reused, in one sense or another, at the end of life. Polymers made from oil (as most are) contain energy in another sense—that of the oil that enters the production as a primary feedstock. Natural materials such as wood similarly contain “intrinsic” or “contained” energy, this time derived from solar radiation absorbed during growth. Views differ on whether intrinsic energy should be included in embodied energy or not. There is a sense in which not only polymers and woods but also metals carry intrinsic energy that could—by chemical reaction or by burning the metal in the form of finely divided powder—be recovered, so omitting it when reporting production energy for polymers but including it for metals seems inconsistent. For this reason we will include intrinsic energy from nonrenewable resources in reporting embodied energies, which generally lie in the range of 25 to 250 MJ/kg, though a few are much higher. The existence of intrinsic energy has another consequence: The energy to recycle a material is sometimes much less than that required for its first production, because the intrinsic energy is retained. Typical values lie in the range 10 to 100 MJ/kg. The production of 1 kilogram of material is associated with undesired gas emissions, among which CO2, NOx, SOx, and CH4 cause general concern (global warming, acidification, ozone-layer depletion). The quantities can be large— each kilogram of virgin aluminum produced with energy from fossil fuels creates some 9 kilograms of CO 2, 40 grams of NOx , and 90 grams of SOx (Table 15.2). Material production is generally associated with other undesirable outputs, particularly toxic wastes and particulates, but these can, in principle, be dealt with at the source. Approximate data for embodied energy and CO2 burden of materials are listed in Appendix A.\n \n Estimates for material processing energies (at an overall conversion efficiency of 15%) Many processes depend on casting, evaporation, or deformation. It is helpful to have a feel for the approximate magnitudes of energies required by these.

Many processes use electric energy, generated from primary energy with a conversion efficiency on the order of 38%. The use of this for electroheating or for electroprocessing (like electroforming) involves further losses. Scrap, discarded material, and other wastes carry with them an energy investment that does not appear in the “good” casting, moldings, or forgings that are the output of the processes. Other process routes involve other energy conversion sequences, all with their losses. It is possible, as we do below, to estimate the energy to melt, mold, vaporize, or deform a material, but to express this in terms of primary energy it must be divided by the product of the conversion efficiencies of each conversion step. For the sake of example we set this overall efficiency at a (realistic) 15%. Melting To melt a material, it must first be heated to its melting point, requiring a minimum input of the heat Cp (Tm − T0), and then caused to melt, requiring the latent heat of melting Lm: Hmin = Cp ðTm − T0 Þ + Lm\n \n (15.1)\n \n where H min is the minimum energy per kilogram for melting, C p is the specific heat, Tm is the melting point, and T0 is the ambient temperature. A close correlation exists between Lm and Cp Tm:\n \n 15.4 The Eco-Attributes of Materials\n \n Lm ≈ 0:4 Cp Tm\n \n (15.2)\n \n and for metals and alloys Tm &gt;&gt; T0, giving Hmin ≈ 1:4 Cp Tm\n \n (15.3)\n \n  Assuming efficiency of 15%, the estimated energy to melt 1 kilogram Hm is  Hm ≈ 8:4 Cp Tm\n \n (15.4)\n \n the asterisk recalling that it is an estimate. For metals and alloys, the  quantity Hm lies in the range 1 to 8 MJ/kg. Vaporization As a rule of thumb, the latent heat of vaporization Lv is larger than that for melting, Lm, by a factor of 24 ± 5, and the boiling point Tb is larger than the melting point T m by a factor 2.1 ± 0.5. Using the same assumptions as before, we find an estimate for the energy to evaporate 1 kg of material (as in PVD processing) to be Hv ≈ 76 Cp Tm\n \n (15.5)\n \n again assuming an efficiency of 15%. For metals and alloys, the quantity Hv lies in the range 6 to 60 MJ/kg. Deformation Deformation processes like rolling or forging generally involve large strains. Assuming an average flow strength of ðσ y + σ uts Þ/2, a strain of order 1, and an efficiency factor of 15%, we find, the work of deformation per kg, to be WD ≈ 3ðσ y + σ uts Þ\n \n (15.6)\n \n where σy is the yield strength and σuts is the tensile strength. For metals and alloys, the quantity WD lies in the range 0.05 to 2 MJ/kg. We conclude that casting or deformation requires processing energies that are small compared to the production energy of the material being processed, but the larger energies required for vapor-phase processing may become comparable with those for material production.\n \n End of life Figure 15.4 introduces the options: landfill, combustion for heat recovery, recycling, reengineering, and reuse. Landfill Much of what we now reject is committed to landfill. Already there is a problem—the land available to “fill” in this way is already, in some European countries, almost full. Administrations react by charging a landfill tax—currently somewhere near €50 per tonne and rising, seeking to divert waste into the other channels of Figure 15.4.\n \n 445\n \n Materials and the Environment\n \n Product manufacture\n \n Material production\n \n cl cy yc nc Dow\n \n Re\n \n e\n \n le\n \n Combustion\n \n Product use\n \n se\n \n Natural resources\n \n eu\n \n CHAPTER 15:\n \n Reengineer Recondition\n \n 446\n \n R\n \n End of first life\n \n Landfill\n \n FIGURE 15.4 End of life options: landfill, combustion, recycling, refurbishment or upgrading, and reuse.\n \n Combustion for heat recovery Materials, we know, contain energy. Rather than throw them away it would seem better to retrieve and reuse some of their energy by controlled combustion, capturing the heat. But this is not as easy as it sounds. First there is the need for a primary sorting to separate combustibles from noncombustible material. Then the combustion must be carried out under conditions that do not generate toxic fumes or residues, requiring high temperatures, sophisticated control, and expensive equipment. Energy recovery is imperfect partly because it is incomplete and partly because the incoming waste carries a moisture content that has to be boiled off. Recycling Recycling requires energy, and this energy carries its burden of gases. But the recycle energy is generally small compared to the initial production energy, making recycling—when it is possible at all—an energyefficient proposition. It may not, however, be one that is cost-efficient; that depends on the degree to which the material has become dispersed. In-house scrap, generated at the point of production or manufacture, is localized and is already recycled efficiently (near 100% recovery). Widely distributed “scrap”—material contained in discarded products—is much more expensive to collect, separate, and clean. Many materials cannot be recycled, although they may still be reused in a lower-grade activity; continuous-fiber composites, for instance, cannot be reseparated economically into fiber and polymer in order to recycle them, though they can be chopped and used as fillers. Most other materials require an input of virgin material to avoid build-up of uncontrollable impurities. Thus the\n \n 15.5 Eco-Selection\n \n fraction of a material’s production that can ultimately reenter the cycle of Figure 15.4 depends both on the material itself and on the product into which it has been incorporated. Reengineering Reengineering is the refurbishment or upgrading of the product or of its recoverable components. Certain criteria must be met to make it practical. One is that the design of the product is fixed or that the technology on which it is based is evolving so slowly that there remains a market for the restored product. Some examples are housing, office space, and road and rail infrastructure; these are sectors with enormous appetites for materials. Reuse Reuse is the redistribution of the product to a consumer sector that is willing to accept it in its used state, perhaps to reuse it for its original purpose (e.g., a second-hand car), perhaps to adapt it to another (converting a car into a hot rod or a bus into a mobile home). Charity stores pass on clothing, books, and objects acquired from those for whom they had become waste; the stores sell them to others who perceive them to have value. Reuse is the most benign of the end-of-life scenarios.\n \n 15.5 ECO-SELECTION To select materials to minimize impact on the environment we must first ask—as we did in Section 15.2—which phase of the life-cycle of the product under consideration makes the largest contribution. The answer guides the choice of strategy to ameliorate that contribution (Figure 15.5). The strategies are described in the following sections. The material production phase If material production is the dominant phase of life, this becomes the first target. Drink containers (Figure 15.6) provide an example: They consume materials and energy during material extraction and production, but apart from transport and refrigeration, which are small, not thereafter. We use the energy consumed in extracting and refining the material (the embodied energy noted in Table 15.2) as the measure; CO2, NOx, and SOx emissions are related to it, although not in a simple way. The energy associated with the production of 1 kilogram of a material is Hp, that per unit volume is Hpρ, where ρ is the density of the material. The bar charts of Figures 15.7 and 15.8 show these two quantities for ceramics, metals, polymers, and composites (hybrids). On a “per kg” basis (upper chart), glass, the material of the first container, carry the lowest penalty. Steel is slightly higher. Polymers carry a much higher energy penalty than steel. Aluminum and the other light alloys carry the highest penalty of all. But if these same materials are compared on a “per m3” basis (lower chart) the conclusions change: Glass is still the lowest, but now commodity polymers, such\n \n 447\n \n CHAPTER 15:\n \n Materials and the Environment\n \n 1.

But is comparison “per kg” or “per m3” the right way to do it? Rarely. To deal with environmental impact at the production phase properly we must seek to minimize the energy, the CO2 burden, or the eco-indicator value per unit of function. Performance indices that include energy content are derived in the same way as those for weight or cost (Chapter 5).

They are used in exactly the same way as the E − ρ and σ f − ρ charts for minimum mass design. Most polymers are derived from oil. This leads to statements that they are energy-intense, with implications for their future. The two charts in Figures 5.9 and 5.10 show that, per unit of function in bending (the commonest mode of loading), most polymers carry a lower energy penalty than primary aluminum, magnesium, or titanium, and several are competitive with steel. Most of the energy consumed in the production of metals such as steel, aluminum, a magnesium is used to reduce the ore to the elemental metal, so that these materials, when recycled, require much less energy.

It is used in the same way as Figure 4.4.\n \n The product manufacture phase Shaping materials, as we discussed earlier, requires energy. Certainly it is important to save energy in production. But higher priority often attaches to the local impact of emissions and toxic waste during manufacture, and this depends crucially on local circumstances. Paper making (to take an example) uses very large quantities of water. Historically the wastewater was heavily polluted with alkalis and particulates, devastating the river systems into which it was dumped. Today, the best paper mills discharge water that is as clean and pure as it was when it entered. Production sites of the former communist-bloc countries are terminally polluted; those producing the same materials elsewhere, using best-practice methods, have no such problems. Clean manufacture is the issue here. The use phase The eco-impact of the use phase of energy-consuming products has nothing to do with the energy content of the materials\n \n 15.6 Case Studies: Drink Containers and Crash Barriers\n \n themselves—indeed, minimizing this may frequently have the opposite effect on use energy. Use energy depends on mechanical, thermal, and electrical efficiencies; it is minimized by maximizing these. Fuel efficiency in transport systems (measured, say, by MJ/km) correlates closely with the mass of the vehicle itself; the objective then becomes minimizing mass. Energy efficiency in refrigeration or heating systems is achieved by minimizing the heat flux into or out of the system; the objective is then minimizing thermal conductivity or thermal inertia. Energy efficiency in electrical generation, transmission, and conversion is maximized by minimizing the ohmic losses in the conductor; here the objective is minimizing electrical resistance while meeting necessary constraints on strength, cost, and so on. Selection to meet these objectives is exactly what the previous chapters of this book were about. The product disposal phase The environmental consequences of the final phase of product life has many aspects. Increasingly, legislation dictates disposal procedures, take-back, and recycle requirements, and—through landfill taxes and subsidized recycling—deploys market forces to determine the end-of-life choice.\n \n 15.6 CASE STUDIES: DRINK CONTAINERS AND CRASH BARRIERS The energy content of containers The containers shown earlier in Figure 15.6 are examples of products for which the first and second phases of life—material production and product manufacture—consume the most energy and generate the most emissions. Thus material selection to minimize energy and consequent gas and particle emissions focuses on these. Table 15.3 summarizes the requirements. The masses of five competing container types, the material of which they are made, and the specific energy content of each are listed in Tables 15.4 and 15.5. Their production involves molding or deformation; approximate energies for each are listed. All five materials can be recycled. Which container type carries the lowest overall energy penalty per unit of fluid contained?\n \n Table 15.3 Design Requirements for the Containers Function Constraint Objective Free variable\n \n Container for cold drink Must be recyclable Minimize embodied energy per unit capacity Choice of material\n \n 453\n \n 454\n \n CHAPTER 15:\n \n Materials and the Environment\n \n Table 15.4 Details of the Containers Container Type PET 400-ml bottle PE 1-liter milk bottle Glass 750-ml bottle Al 440-ml can Steel 440-ml can\n \n Material\n \n Mass, g\n \n Mass/ Liter, g\n \n Energy/ Liter, MJ/Liter\n \n PET High-density PE Soda glass 5000 series Al alloy Plain carbon steel\n \n 25 38 325 20 45\n \n 62 38 433 45 102\n \n 5.4 3.2 8.2 9.0 2.4\n \n Table 15.5 Data for the Materials of the Containers (from Appendix A) Material PET PE Soda glass 5000 series Al alloy Plain carbon steel\n \n Embodied Energy, MJ/kg 84 81 15.5 210 32\n \n Forming Method Molding Molding Molding Deep drawing Deep drawing\n \n Forming Energy, MJ/kg 3.1 3.1 4.9 0.13 0.15\n \n The method and results A comparison of the energies in Table 15.5 shows that the energy to shape the container is always less than that to produce the material in the first place. Only in the case of glass is the forming energy significant. The dominant phase is material production. Summing the two energies for each material and multiplying by the container mass per liter of capacity gives the ranking shown in the second to last column of Table 15.4. Steel can carry the lowest energy penalty, glass and aluminum the highest.\n \n Crash barriers Barriers to protect the driver and passengers in road vehicles are of two types: those that are static—the central divider of a freeway, for instance— and those that move—the bumper of the vehicle itself (Figure 15.11). The static types line tens of thousands of miles of road. Once in place they consume no energy, create no CO2, and last a long time. The dominant phases of their life in the sense of the life-cycle shown in Figure 15.1 are material production and manufacture. The bumper, by contrast, is part of the vehicle; it adds to its weight and thus to its fuel consumption. The dominant phase here is use. This means that, if eco-design is the objective, the criteria for selecting materials for the two sorts of barrier will differ. We take as a criterion for the first that of maximizing the energy that the\n \n 15.6 Case Studies: Drink Containers and Crash Barriers\n \n Reaction from supports\n \n Impact W\n \n FIGURE 15.11 Two crash barriers: one static, the other—the bumper—attached to something that moves.

Table 15.6 summarizes. In an impact, the barrier is loaded in bending (Figure 15.11). Its function is to transfer load from the point of impact to the support structure, where reaction from the foundation or from crush elements in the vehicle support or absorb it. To do this the material of the barrier must have high strength, σf, be adequately tough and able to be recycled. That of the static barrier must meet these constraints with minimum embodied energy as the objective, since this will reduce the overall life energy most effectively. We know from Section 15.5 that this means materials with large values of the index 2/3\n \n M3 =\n \n σf\n \n Hp ρ\n \n (15.9)\n \n where σf is the yield strength, ρ the density, and Hp the embodied energy per kg of material.

We leave that as one of the exercises in order to show here an alternative: simply plotting the index itself as a bar chart. Figures 15.12 and 15.13 show the result for metals, polymers, and polymer-matrix composites. The first guides the selection for static barriers. It shows that embodied energy (for a given load-bearing capacity) is minimized by making the barrier out of carbon steel or cast iron or wood; nothing else comes close. The second figure guides selection for the mobile barrier. Here CFRP (continuous fiber carbon epoxy, for instance) excels in its strength per unit weight, but it is not recyclable. Heavier but recyclable are alloys of magnesium, titanium, and aluminum. Polymers, which rank poorly in the first figure, now become candidates—even without reinforcement, they can be as good as steel. Postscript Metal crash barriers have a profile like that shown in Figure 15.11 (left). The curvature increases the second moment of area of the crosssection and through this the bending stiffness and strength. This is an example of combining material choice and section shape (Section 9.5) to optimize a design.\n \n 15.7 Summary and Conclusions\n \n Bending strength per unit mass 10−1\n \n CFRP\n \n Mg alloys\n \n Yield strength2/3/Density\n \n Ti alloys\n \n 10−2\n \n Softwood GFRP\n \n PA\n \n Al alloys Low alloy steel Low carbon steel Cast iron\n \n PEEK PC PS\n \n PET ABS PBH PE\n \n DMC\n \n Bamboo\n \n PMMA PP Epoxy Polyester Phenolic\n \n Ni alloys\n \n PTFE\n \n Stainless steel 10−3\n \n Hardwood Plywood SMC\n \n Cu alloys High carbon steel\n \n Foamed polymers\n \n Pb alloys\n \n 10−4\n \n Metals\n \n Polymers\n \n Hybrids\n \n MFA, 09\n \n FIGURE 15.13 Material choice for the mobile barrier; the units are (MPa)2/3/(kg/m3).

Dealing with all of these requires data not only for the obvious eco-attributes (e.g., energy, CO 2 and other emissions, toxicity, and the ability to be recycled) but also for mechanical, thermal, electrical, and chemical properties. Thus if material production is the phase of concern, selection is based on minimizing production energy or the associated emissions (e.g., CO2 production). But if it is the use phase that is of concern, selection is based instead on light weight and excellence as a thermal insulator or as an electrical conductor (while meeting other constraints on stiffness, strength, cost, etc.). This chapter developed methods to deal with these issues. The methods are most effective when implemented in software. The CES Edu system, described in Chapters 5, 6, 13, and 14 contains eco-data for materials and includes an eco-audit tool to analyze product life in the manner of Figure 15.3.\n \n 457\n \n 458\n \n CHAPTER 15:\n \n Materials and the Environment\n \n If you found this chapter interesting and would like to read more, you will find the ideas it contains developed more fully in the first book listed in the following section.\n \n 15.8 FURTHER READING Ashby, M.F.

Excellent design also gives pleasure. Pleasure derives from form, color, texture, feel, and the associations that these invoke. Pleasing design says something about itself; generally speaking, honest statements are more satisfying than deception, though eccentric or humorous designs can be appealing too. Materials play a central role in this. A major reason for introducing new materials is the greater freedom of design that they allow. Metals, during the past century, allowed the building of structures that could not have been built before: cast iron, the Crystal Palace; wrought iron, the Eiffel Tower; drawn steel cable, the Golden Gate Bridge—all undeniably beautiful. Polymers lend themselves to bright colors, satisfying textures, and great freedom of form; they have opened new styles of design, of which some of the best examples are found in household appliances: Food mixers, hair dryers, mobile phones, MP3 players, and vacuum cleaners make extensive and imaginative use of materials to allow styling, weight, feel, and form that give pleasure. Those who concern themselves with this aesthetic dimension of engineering are known, rather confusingly, as “industrial designers.” This chapter introduces some of the ideas of industrial design, emphasizing the role of materials. It ends with case studies. But first a word of caution. Previous chapters dealt with systematic ways of choosing material and processes. “Systematic” means that if you do it and I do it, following the same procedure, we will get the same result, and that result, next year, will be the same as it is today. Industrial design is not, in this sense, systematic. Succes, here involves sensitivity to fashion, custom, and educational background, and is influenced (even manipulated) by advertising and association. The views in this chapter are partly those of writers who seem to me to say sensible things,\n \n 16.2 The Requirements Pyramid\n \n and partly my own. You may not agree with them, but if they make you think about designing to give pleasure, the chapter has done what it should. The ideas in this chapter are developed more fully in the first text listed in “Further reading.”\n \n 16.2 THE REQUIREMENTS PYRAMID The pen with which I am writing this chapter cost $5 (Figure 16.1, upper image). If you go to the right shop, you can find a pen that costs well over $1000 (lower image). Does it write 200 times better than mine? Unlikely; mine writes perfectly well. Yet there is a market for expensive pens. Why? A product has a cost—the outlay in manufacture and marketing it. It has a price—the sum at which it is offered to the consumer. And it has a value—a measure of what the consumer thinks it is worth. The expensive pens command the price they do because the consumer perceives their value to justify it. What determines value? Three things. Functionality, provided by sound technical design, clearly plays a role. The requirements pyramid in Figure 16.2 has this as its base: The product must work properly and be safe and economical. Functionality alone is not enough: The product must be easy to understand and operate, and these are questions of usability, the second tier in the figure. The third, completing the pyramid, is the requirement that the product give satisfaction: that it enhances the life of those who own or use it.\n \n Industrial design\n \n Technical design\n \n FIGURE 16.1 Pens, inexpensive and expensive. The chosen material—acrylic in the upper two; gold, silver, and enamel in the lower two—creates the aesthetics and the associations of the pens.

The lower part of the pyramid tends to be called “technical design,” the upper part, “industrial design,” suggesting that they are separate activities. It is better to think of all three tiers as part of a single process that we shall call “product design.”\n \n 463\n \n 464\n \n CHAPTER 16:\n \n Materials and Industrial Design\n \n The value of a product is a measure of the degree to which it meets (or exceeds) the expectation of the consumer for all three of these—functionality, usability, and satisfaction. Think of this as the product. It is very like human character. An admirable character is one that functions well, interacts effectively, and is rewarding company. An unappealing character is one that does none of these. An odious character is one that behaves in such an unattractive way that you cannot bear to be near them. Products are the same. All the pens in Figure 16.1 function well and are easy to use. The huge difference in price implies that the lower two provide a degree of satisfaction not offered by the upper two. The most obvious difference between them is the materials of which they are made—the upper pair of molded acrylic, the lower pair of gold, silver, and enamel. Acrylic is the material of toothbrush handles, something you throw away after use. Gold and silver are the materials of precious jewelry; they have associations of craftsmanship, of heirlooms passed from one generation to the next. Well, that’s part of the difference, but there is more. To find it we need to address a question—what creates product character?\n \n 16.3 PRODUCT CHARACTER Figure 16.3 shows a way of dissecting product character. It is a map of the ideas we are going to explore; like all maps there is a lot of detail, but we need it to find our way. In the center is information about the product itself: the basic design requirements, its function, its features. The way these are thought through and developed is conditioned by the context, shown in the circle above the product. The context is set by the answers to the questions in the top box: Who? Where? When? Why? Consider the first of these: Who? A designer seeking to create a product attractive to women will make choices that differ from those for a product intended for children, or for elderly people, or for sportsmen. Where? A product for use in the home requires a different choice of material and form than one to be used—say—in a school or hospital. When? One intended for occasional use is designed in a different way from one used all the time; one for formal occasions differs from one for informal use. Why? A product that is primarily utilitarian involves different design decisions from one that is largely a lifestyle statement. The context influences and conditions all the decisions that the designer makes in finding a solution. It sets the mood.1 On the left of the product circle of Figure 16.3 lie packages of information about the materials and the processes used to shape, join, and finish it. Each 1 Many designers working on a project assemble a mood board with images of the sort of people for whom the product is intended, the surroundings in which they suppose it will be used, and other products that the intended user group might own, seeking to capture the flavor of their lifestyle.\n \n 16.3 Product Character\n \n Who?\n \n Men/women Children/elderly...\n \n Where?\n \n Home/office Europe/Africa...\n \n When?\n \n Day/night All the time/occasionally...\n \n Why?\n \n To fill a basic need To meet an aspiration...\n \n Aesthetics 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000\n \n Steels\n \n Ceramics\n \n Cu-alloys\n \n Polymers\n \n Al-alloys\n \n Metals\n \n Ti-alloys Ni-alloys Zn-alloys\n \n Natural\n \n Context\n \n Materials\n \n Product\n \n Associations\n \n Wealth, power Learning, sophistication Plants, animals High-tech\n \n Perceptions\n \n Playful/serious Feminine/masculine Expensive/cheap Youthful/mature\n \n Personality\n \n Features Function\n \n Composites\n \n Processes\n \n Color, transparency Form, symmetry Feel, texture Sound\n \n Usability\n \n Joining Compression\n \n Casting\n \n Rotation\n \n Deformation\n \n Injection\n \n Molding\n \n RTM\n \n Composite\n \n Blow\n \n Powder\n \n Vacuum\n \n Physical matching\n \n Bio-metric Bio-mechanical\n \n Scale, movement Posture, work height Force, energy Attention span\n \n Shaping\n \n Rapid prototype Surfacing\n \n Information transfer\n \n Operation Feedback\n \n MFA, 09\n \n Product “physiology”\n \n Text, icons Symbols Audible signals Visual signals Tactile signals\n \n Product “psychology”\n \n FIGURE 16.3 The breakdown of product character. Context defines the intentions or “mood”; materials and processes create the flesh and bones; the user interface determines usability ; and the product’s aesthetics, associations, and perceptions create its personality.\n \n illustrates the library, so to speak, from which the choices can be made. They are the families, classes, and members that we first met in Chapter 3. Choosing these to provide functionality—the bottom of the pyramid—has been the subject of this book so far. Material and process give the product its tangible form, its flesh and bones so to speak; they create the product physiology. On the right in Figure 16.3 are two more packages of information. The lower one—usability—characterizes the ways in which the product communicates\n \n 465\n \n 466\n \n CHAPTER 16:\n \n Materials and Industrial Design\n \n with the user: the interaction with their sensory, cognitive, and motor functions. Product success requires a mode of operation that, as far as possible, is intuitive and does not require taxing effort, and an interface that communicates the state of the product and its response to user action by visible, acoustic, or tactile response. It is remarkable how many products fail in this and, by doing so, exclude many of their potential users. There is today an awareness of this, giving rise to research on inclusive design: design to make products that can be used by a larger spectrum of the population. One package remains: the one labeled personality. Product personality derives from aesthetics, associations, and perceptions, three words that need explanation. Anaesthetics dull the senses. Aesthetics do the opposite: They stimulate the five senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell, and via them, the brain. The first row of the personality box elaborates: We are concerned here with color, form, texture, feel, smell, and sound. Think of a new car: its styling, its smell, the sound its doors make on closing. They are no accident. Car makers spend millions to make them as they are. A products also has associations—the second row of the box. Associations are the things the product reminds you of, the things it suggests. The Land Rover and other SUVs have forms and (often) colors that mimic those of military vehicles. The streamlining of American cars of the 1960s and 1970s carried associations with aerospace. It may be an accident that the VW Beetle has a form that suggests the insect, but the others are no accident; they were deliberately chosen by the designer to appeal to the consumer group (the Who?) at which the product was aimed. Finally, the most abstract quality of all, perceptions. Perceptions are the reactions the product induces in an observer, the way it makes you feel. Table 16.1 Some Perceived Attributes of Products Perceptions (with Opposites) Aggressive—Passive Cheap—Expensive Classic—Trendy Clinical—Friendly Clever—Silly Common—Exclusive Decorated—Plain Delicate—Rugged Disposable—Lasting Dull—Sexy Elegant—Clumsy\n \n Extravagant—Restrained Feminine—Masculine Formal—Informal Handmade—Mass-produced Honest—Deceptive Humorous—Serious Informal—Formal Irritating—Lovable Lasting—Disposable Mature—Youthful Retro—Futuristic\n \n 16.4 Using Materials and Processes to Create Product Personality\n \n Here there is room for disagreement; the perceptions of a product change with time and depend on the culture and background of the observer. Yet in the final analysis it is the perception that causes the consumer, when choosing between a multitude of similar models, to prefer one above the others; it creates the “must have” feeling (see chapter cover image). Table 16.1 lists some perceptions with their opposites in order to sharpen the meaning. They derive from product reviews and magazines specializing in product design; they are a part of a vocabulary, one that is used to communicate views about product character.\n \n 16.4 USING MATERIALS AND PROCESSES TO CREATE PRODUCT PERSONALITY Do materials, of themselves, have a personality? There is a school of thinking that holds as a central tenet that materials must be used “honestly.” This means that deception and disguise are unacceptable—each material must be used in ways that expose its intrinsic qualities and natural appearance. It has its roots in the tradition of craftsmanship—potters’ use of clays and glazes, carpenters’ use of woods, the skills of silversmiths and glass makers in crafting beautiful objects that exploit the unique qualities of the materials with which they work and the integrity of their craft. This is a view to be respected. But it is not the only one. Design integrity is a quality that consumers value, but they also value other qualities: humor, sympathy, surprise, provocation, even shock. You don’t have to look far to find a product that has one of these, and often that quality is achieved by using materials in ways that deceive. Polymers are frequently used in this way—their adaptability invites it. And, of course, it is partly a question of definition—if you say that a characterizing attribute of polymers is their ability to mimic other materials, then using them in this way is honest.\n \n Materials and the senses: Aesthetic attributes Aesthetic attributes are those that relate to the senses: touch, sight, hearing, taste, and smell (Table 16.2). Almost everyone would agree that metals feel “cold”; that cork feels “warm”; that a wine glass, when struck, “rings”; that a pewter mug sounds “dull,” even “dead.” A polystyrene water glass can look indistinguishable from one made of glass, but pick it up and it feels lighter, less cold, less rigid; tap it and it does not sound the same. It leaves the impression that is so different from glass that, in an expensive restaurant, it would be completely unacceptable. Materials, then, have certain characterizing aesthetic attributes. Let us see if we can pin these down.\n \n 467\n \n 468\n \n CHAPTER 16:\n \n Materials and Industrial Design\n \n Table 16.2 Some Aesthetic Attributes of Materials Sense\n \n Attribute 8 Warm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; Cold Soft Touch &gt; Hard &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : Flexible Stiff 8 Optically clear &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Transparent &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Translucent &gt; &lt; Opaque Sight &gt; Reflective &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Glossy &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : Matte Textured\n \n Sense\n \n Attribute 8 Muffled &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dull &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; Sharp Hearing &gt; Resonant &gt; &gt; Ringing &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : High-pitched Low-pitched\n \n ( Taste Smell\n \n Bitter Sweet\n \n Touch: Soft–hard/warm–cold Steel is “hard”; so is glass; diamond is harder than both of them. Hard materials do not scratch easily; indeed they can be used to scratch other materials. They generally accept a high polish, resist wear, and are durable. The impression that a material is hard is directly related to its Vickers hardness H. Here is an example of a sensory attribute that relates directly to a technical one. “Soft” sounds like the opposite of “hard” but it has more to do with modulus E than with hardness H. A soft material deflects when handled, it gives a little, it is squashy; but when it is released it returns to its original shape. Elastomers (rubbers) feel soft; so do polymer foams. Both have moduli that are 100 to 10,000 lower than ordinary “hard” solids; it is this that makes thempfeel ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi soft. Soft to hard is used as one axis in Figure 16.4. It uses the quantity EH as a measure. A material feels “cold” to the touch if it conducts heat away from the finger quickly; it is “warm” if it does not. This has something to do with its thermal conductivity λ but there is more to it than that—it depends also on its specific of the perceived coldness or warmth of a material is the heat Cp. A pmeasure ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi quantity λCp ρ. It is shown as the other axis in Figure 16.4, which nicely displays the tactile properties of materials. Polymer foams and low-density woods are warm and soft; so are balsa and cork. Ceramics and metals are cold and hard; so is glass. Polymers and composites lie in between. Sight: Transparency, color, reflectivity Metals are opaque. Most ceramics, because they are polycrystalline and the crystals scatter light, are either opaque or translucent. Glasses, and single crystals of some ceramics, are transparent. Polymers have the greatest diversity of optical transparency,\n \n Cold\n \n 16.4 Using Materials and Processes to Create Product Personality\n \n Soft–Hard / Warm–Cold Metals\n \n Cu alloys Ni alloys\n \n Technical ceramics Steels\n \n Al alloys\n \n SiC\n \n Zinc alloys WC B4C Al2O3\n \n Mg alloys\n \n Nontechnical ceramics\n \n Lead alloys\n \n Stainless steel\n \n Stone\n \n Warm to cold\n \n Polymers and elastomers\n \n Silicones\n \n EVA\n \n PTFE\n \n Si3N4\n \n Ti alloys\n \n Concrete PE ABS Brick\n \n Epoxies\n \n Glass ceramic\n \n PA\n \n CFRP\n \n Polyurethane\n \n Glass PVC GFRP Wood PMMA\n \n Neoprene\n \n Foams\n \n Flexible polymer foams\n \n Butyl rubber\n \n Isoprene\n \n Composites\n \n PS\n \n Leather\n \n Cork\n \n PP\n \n Natural materials\n \n Warm\n \n Rigid polymer foams MFA, 09\n \n Soft\n \n Soft to hard\n \n Hard\n \n FIGURE 16.4 Tactile qualities of materials.

Transparency is commonly described by a four-level ranking that uses easily understood everyday words: “opaque,” “translucent,” “transparent,” and “water-clear.” Figure 16.5 ranks the transparency of common materials. So that the data are spread in a useful way—they are plotted against cost. The cheapest materials offering optical-quality transparency (“water clarity”) are glass, PS, PET, and PMMA. Epoxies can be transparent but not with water clarity. Nylons are, at best, translucent. All metals, most ceramics, and all carbon-filled or reinforced polymers are opaque. Color can be quantified by analyzing spectra but this—from a design standpoint—doesn’t help much. A more effective method is one of color\n \n 469\n \n CHAPTER 16:\n \n 100\n \n Materials and Industrial Design\n \n PEEK Boron carbide Titanium alloys\n \n Transparency Silicon carbide\n \n Tungsten alloys PTFE\n \n Silicones\n \n 10\n \n Silicon carbide\n \n Polyurethanes\n \n Silica glass\n \n Price (USD/kg)\n \n 470\n \n PC Pyrex\n \n Polyurethane\n \n Cellulose acetate\n \n ABS\n \n PMMA Ionomers Epoxies 1\n \n PET PS Soda glass\n \n Polyesters\n \n Acetal\n \n Nylon\n \n Neoprene\n \n Nickel Phenolics alloys PP PE Stainless PVC steels Copper alloys\n \n Isoprene Butyl rubber\n \n 0.1\n \n Zinc alloys Brick Carbon steels Cast iron Concrete\n \n Water-clear\n \n Transparent\n \n Translucent\n \n Opaque\n \n MFA, 09\n \n FIGURE 16.5 Here transparency is ranked on a four-point scale, from water-clear to opaque.

Finally there is reflectivity, an attribute that depends partly on the material and partly on the state of its surface. Like transparency, it is commonly described by a ranking: dead matte, eggshell, semi-gloss, gloss, mirror. Hearing: Pitch and brightness The frequency of sound (pitch) emitted when p anffiffiffiffiffiffiffi object is struck relates to its material properties. A measure of this pitch E/ρ is used as one axis in Figure 16.6. Frequency is not the only aspect of acoustic response—the other has to do with the damping or loss coefficient η. A highly damped material sounds dull and muffled; one with low damping rings. Acoustic brightness—the inverse of damping—is used as the other axis in Figure 16.6. It groups materials that have similar acoustic behavior. 2\n \n Pantone (www.pantone.com) provides detailed advice on color selection, including color-matching charts and good descriptions of the associations and perceptions of color.\n \n Bright\n \n 16.4 Using Materials and Processes to Create Product Personality\n \n Pitch and brightness\n \n Cu alloys Ti alloys Glass\n \n Technical ceramics\n \n Metals B4 C SiC\n \n Acoustic brightness\n \n Nontechnical ceramics Polymers\n \n Si3N4\n \n Ni alloys Steels\n \n Zinc alloys Cast Stone irons PA\n \n WC\n \n Al alloys CFRP\n \n Foams\n \n Flexible polymer foams\n \n PMMA PS PP PTFE PE\n \n Polyurethane\n \n EVA Silicones\n \n Mg alloys GFRP\n \n Cork\n \n Lead alloys Rigid polymer foams Ionomers Leather\n \n Dull\n \n Butyl Isoprene rubber Natural rubber\n \n Composites\n \n Wood Brick ABS Concrete\n \n Elastomers\n \n Neoprene\n \n Al2O3\n \n MFA, 09\n \n Low\n \n Acoustic pitch\n \n High\n \n FIGURE 16.6 Acoustic properties of materials. The “ring” of a wine glass occurs because glass is an acoustically bright material with a high natural pitch; the dull “ping” of a plastic glass occurs because polymers are much less bright and—in the same shape—vibrate at a lower frequency. Materials at the top right make good bells; those at the bottom left are good for damping sound.\n \n Bronze, glass, and steel ring when struck, and the sound they emit has—on a relative scale—a high pitch; they are used to make bells. Alumina, on this ranking, has bell-like qualities. Rubber, foams, and many polymers sound dull and, relative to metals, vibrate at low frequencies; they are used for sound damping. Lead, too, is dull and low-pitched; it is used to clad buildings for sound insulation. The three figures show that each material class has a certain recognizable aesthetic character. Ceramics are hard, cold, high-pitched, and acoustically bright. Metals, too, are relatively hard and cold but although some (e.g., bronze) ring when struck, others (e.g., lead) are dull. Polymers and foams are most nearly like natural materials—warm, soft, low-pitched, and muffled, although some have outstanding optical clarity and almost all can\n \n 471\n \n 472\n \n CHAPTER 16:\n \n Materials and Industrial Design\n \n be colored. But their low hardness means that they scratch easily, losing their gloss. These qualities of a material contribute to a product’s personality. The product acquires some of the attributes of the material from which it is made, an effect that designers recognize and use when seeking to create a personality. A stainless steel fascia, whether it is in a car or on a hi-fi system, has a different personality from one of CFRP, of polished wood, or of leather, and that in part is because the product has acquired some of the aesthetic qualities of the material.\n \n Materials and the mind: Associations and perceptions So a material certainly has aesthetic qualities—but can it be said to have a personality? At first sight, no—it only acquires one when used in a product. Like an actor, it can assume many different personalities, depending on the role it is asked to play. Wood in fine furniture suggests craftsmanship, but in a packing case, cheap utility. Glass in the lens of a camera has associations of precision engineering, but in a beer bottle, disposable packaging. Even gold, so often associated with wealth and power, has different associations when used in microcircuits: technical functionality. But wait. The object shown in Figure 16.7 has its own somber association. It appears to be made of polished hardwood—the traditional material for such things. If you had to choose one, you would probably not think polished hardwood inappropriate. But suppose I told you it was made of polystyrene foam— would you feel the same? Suddenly it becomes a bin, a wastebasket, inappropriate for its dignified purpose. Materials, it seems, do have personality. Expression through material Think of wood. It is a natural material with a grain that has a surface texture, pattern, color, and feel that other materials do not have. It is tactile—it is perceived as warmer than many other materials and seemingly softer. It is associated with characteristic sounds and smells. It has a tradition; it carries associations of craftsmanship. No two pieces are exactly alike; the woodworker selects the piece on which he will work for its grain and texture. Wood enhances value: The interior of very inexpensive cars is plastic, that of more costly ones is burrFIGURE 16.7 walnut and calf leather. And it ages A coffin. Wood is perceived to be appropriate well, acquiring additional character for its somber, ceremonial function; plastic is with time—objects made of wood perceived to be inappropriate. are more highly valued when they\n \n 16.4 Using Materials and Processes to Create Product Personality\n \n are old than when they are new. There is more to this than just aesthetics; there are the makings of a personality, to be brought out by the designer, certainly, but there nonetheless. Now consider metal. Metals are cold, clean, precise. They ring when struck. They reflect light—particularly when polished. They are accepted and trusted: Machined metal looks strong—its very nature suggests it has been engineered. Metals are associated with robustness, reliability, and permanence. Their strength allows slender structures—the cathedral-like space of railway stations or the span of bridges. They can be worked into flowing forms, such as intricate lace or cast, into solid shapes with elaborate, complex detail. The history of humans and of metals is intertwined—the titles “Bronze age” and “Iron age” tell you how important these metals were— and their qualities are so sharply defined that that they have become ways of describing human qualities—an iron will, a silvery voice, a golden touch, a leaden look. And, like wood, metals can age well, acquiring a patina that makes them more attractive than when newly polished—the bronze of sculptures, the pewter of mugs, the lead of roofs. Ceramics and glass? They have an exceptionally long tradition—think of Greek pottery and Roman glass. They accept almost any color. Their total resistance to scratching, abrasion, discoloration, and corrosion gives them a certain immortality, threatened only by their brittleness. They are—or were—the materials of great craft-based industries: the glass of Venice, the porcelain of Meissen, the pottery of Wedgwood—valued at certain times more highly than silver. But at the same time ceramics and glass can be robust and functional— think of beer bottles. The transparency of glass gives it an ephemeral quality— sometimes you see it, sometimes you don’t. It interacts with light, transmitting it, refracting it, reflecting it. And ceramics today have additional associations— those of advanced technology: kitchen stove-tops, high-pressure/hightemperature valves, space shuttle tiles; all are materials for extreme conditions. And finally polymers. “A cheap, plastic imitation,” it used to be said—and that is a hard reputation to live down. It derives from the early use of plastics to simulate the color and gloss of Japanese handmade pottery, much valued in Europe. Commodity polymers are cheap. They are easily colored and molded (that is why they are called “plastic”), making imitation easy. Unlike ceramics, their gloss is easily scratched, and their colors fade—they do not age gracefully. You can see where the reputation came from. But is it justified? No other class of material can take on as many characters as polymers: Colored, they look like ceramics; printed, they can look like wood or textile; metallized, they look exactly like metal. They can be as transparent as glass or as opaque as lead, as flexible as rubber or as stiff—when reinforced—as aluminum. Plastics emulate precious stones in jewelry, glass in drinking glasses and glazing, wood in counter tops, velvet and fur in clothing, even grass. But despite\n \n 473\n \n 474\n \n CHAPTER 16:\n \n Materials and Industrial Design\n \n this chameleon-like behavior they do have a certain personality: They feel warm—much warmer than metal or glass. They are adaptable— that is part of their special character—and they lend themselves particularly to brightly colored, light hearted, even humorous, design. But their very cheapness creates problems as well as benefits: Our streets, countryside, and rivers are littered with discarded plastic bags and packaging that decay only very slowly. FIGURE 16.8 Lamps. Both have the same technical rating, but differ completely in their personalities. Materials, processes, form, weight, and color all contribute to personality.\n \n The ways in which material, processes, usability, and personality combine to create a product character tuned to context or “mood” are best illustrated by examples. Figure 16.8 illustrates the first. The lamp shown on the left is designed for the office. It is angular, functional, creamy grey, and heavy. Its form and color echo those of computer consoles and keyboards, creating associations of contemporary office technology. Its form and weight transmit the ideas of stability, robustness, efficiency, and fitness for a task—but for tasks in the workplace, not in the bedroom. Materials and processes have been chosen to reinforce these associations and perceptions. The enameled frame is pressed and folded sheet steel, the base weight is cast iron, and the reflector is stainless steel set in a high-impact ABS enclosure. The lamp on the right in Figure 16.8 has the same technical rating as the left one, as well as the same functionality and usability. But there the resemblance ends. This product is not designed for the busy executive but for children (and adults that still enjoy being children), to be used in the playroom or bedroom. It has a contoured form and contrasting translucent colors, and it is light. It is made of colored acrylic in translucent and opaque grades so that the outside glows like a neon sign when it is lit. Its form is partly derived from nature, partly from cartoons and comic strips, giving it a light hearted character. I perceive it as playful, funny, cheerful, and clever—but also as eccentric and easily damaged. You may perceive it in other ways—perception is a personal thing; it depends where you are coming from. Skilled designers manipulate perception to appeal to the user group they wish to attract. Figure 16.9 shows a second example. Here are two contrasting ways of presenting home entertainment systems. On the left: a music center aimed at successful professionals with disposable income, who are comfortable with (or addicted to) advanced technology, and for whom only the best is good enough. The linear form, the use of primitives (rectangles, circles, cylinders, cones), and the matt silver and black proclaim that this product has not just been made, it has been Designed (big D). The formal geometry and finish suggest precision instruments, telescopes, electron microscopes; the shapes resemble those of organ pipes (hence associations of music, of culture). The\n \n 16.4 Using Materials and Processes to Create Product Personality\n \n perception is that of quality cutting-edge technology, a symbol of discriminating taste. The form has much to do with these associations and perceptions, but so too do the materials: brushed aluminum, stainless steel, and black enamel—these are not materials you choose for a cuddly toy. On the right, electronics are presented in another way. This is a company that has retained market share, even increased it, by not changing, at least as far as appearance is concerned. (Fifty years ago I had a radio that looked exactly like this.) The context? Clearly, the home, perhaps aimed at consumers who are uncomfortable with modern technology (though the electronics in these radios is modern enough) or who simply feel that it clashes with the home environment. Each radio has a simple form, it is pastel-colored, it is soft and warm to touch. It is the materials that make the difference: These products are clothed in suede or leather in six or more colors. The combination of form and material creates associations of comfortable furniture, leather purses and handbags (hence luxury, comfort, style), the past (hence stability), and perceptions of solid craftsmanship, reliability, retro-appeal, and traditional but durable design. So there is a character hidden in a material even before it has been made into a recognizable form. It is a sort of embedded personality, a shy one, not always obvious, easily concealed or disguised, but one that, when appropriately manipulated, imparts its qualities to the design. It is for this reason that certain materials are so closely linked to certain design styles. Style is shorthand for a manner of design with a shared set of aesthetics, associations, and perceptions. The Early Industrial style (1800–1890)3 embraced the technologies of the Industrial Revolution, using cast iron and steel, often elaborately decorated to give it a historical façade. The Arts and Crafts Movement from 1860 to 1910 rejected this, choosing instead natural materials and fabrics to create products with the character of traditional handcrafted quality. Art Nouveau (1890–1918), by contrast, exploited the fluid shapes and durability made possible by wrought iron and cast bronze, the warmth and textures of hardwood, and the transparency of glass to create products of flowing, organic character. Art Deco (1918–1935) extended the range of materials to include for the first time plastics (Bakelite and Catalin), allowing production of both luxury products for the rich and mass-produced products for a wider market. The simplicity and explicit character of Bauhaus 3 The dates are, of course, approximate. Design styles do not switch on and off on specific dates; they emerge as a development of, or a reaction to, earlier styles with which they often coexist, and they merge into the styles that follow.\n \n FIGURE 16.9 Consumer electronics. The system on the left is aimed at a different consumer group than the radios on the right. The personalities of each (meaning the combination of aesthetics, associations, and perceptions) have been constructed to appeal to the target group. Materials play a central role here in creating personality. (Image on left courtesy of Bang &amp; Olufsen.)\n \n 475\n \n 476\n \n CHAPTER 16:\n \n Materials and Industrial Design\n \n designs (1919–1933) are most clearly expressed by the use of chromed steel tubing, glass, and molded plywood. Plastics first reached maturity in product design in the cheeky iconoclastic character of the Pop Art style (1940– 1960). Since then the range of materials has continued to increase, and their role in helping to mold product character remains.\n \n 16.5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS What do we learn? The element of satisfaction is central to contemporary product design. It is achieved through an integration of good technical design to provide functionality, proper consideration of the needs of the user in the design of the interface, and imaginative industrial design to create a product that will appeal to the consumers at whom it is aimed. Materials play a central role in this. Functionality is dependent on the choice of proper material and process to meet the technical requirements of the design safely and economically. Usability depends on the visual and tactile properties of materials to convey information and respond to user actions. Above all, the aesthetics, associations, and perceptions of the product are strongly influenced by the choice of the material and its processing, imbuing the product with a personality that, to a greater or lesser extent, reflects that of the material itself. Consumers look for more than functionality in the products they purchase. In the sophisticated markets of developed nations, the “consumer durable” is a thing of the past. The challenge for the designer no longer lies in meeting functional requirements alone but in doing so in a way that also satisfies aesthetic and emotional needs. The product must carry the image and convey the meaning that the consumer seeks: timeless elegance, perhaps, or racy newness. One Japanese manufacturer goes so far as to say: “Desire replaces need as the engine of design.” Not everyone, perhaps, would wish to accept that idea. So we end with simpler words—the same ones with which we started. Good design works. Excellent design also gives pleasure. The imaginative use of materials provides it.

The clear message of Figure 1.1, at the start of this book, is that exactly the opposite is true: Things are changing faster now than ever before. The evolving circumstances of the world in which we live change the boundary conditions for design, and with them those for selecting materials and processes. These changes are driven by a number of forces. First, there is the market pull: the demand from industry for materials that are lighter, stiffer, stronger, tougher, cheaper, and more tolerant of extremes of temperature and environment, and that offer greater functionality. Then there is the science push: the curiosity-driven research of materials experts in the laboratories of universities, industries, and government agencies. There is the driving force of what might be called mega-projects: historically, the Manhattan Project, the development of nuclear power, the space race, and various defense programs; today, one might think of alternative energy technologies, the problems of maintaining an aging infrastructure of drainage, roads, bridges, and aircraft, and the threat of terrorism. There is the trend to miniaturization while at the same time increasing the functionality of products. There is legislation regulating product safety, and there is the increased emphasis on liability established by recent legal precedent. This chapter examines forces for change and the directions in which they push materials and their deployment. Figure 17.1 sets the scene.\n \n 17.2 MARKET PULL AND SCIENCE PUSH Market forces and competition The end users of materials are the manufacturing industries. They decide which materials they will purchase, and adapt their designs to make the best use of them. Their decisions are based on the nature of their products. Materials for large civil structures (which might weigh 100,000 tonnes or more) must be cheap; economy is the overriding consideration. By contrast, the cost of materials for high-tech products (sports equipment, military hardware, space projects, biomedical applications) plays a less important role: For an artificial heart valve, for instance, material cost is almost irrelevant. Performance, not economy, dictates the choice. The market price of a product has several contributions. One is the cost of the materials of which the product is made, but there is also the cost of the research and development that went into its design, the cost of manufacture and marketing, and the perceived value associated with fashion, scarcity, lack of competition, and such like—as described in Chapter 13.

Each of the influences exerts pressure to change the choice of material and process, and stimulates efforts to develop new ones. Market pull and science push are shown on the extreme right and left of the figure.\n \n material costs are a large part of the market value (50%, say)—that is, when the value added to the material is small—the manufacturer seeks to economize on material usage to increase profit or market share. When, by contrast, material costs are a tiny fraction of the market value (1%, say), the manufacturer seeks the materials that will most improve the performance of the product, with little concern for their cost. With this background, examine Figures 17.2 and 17.3. The vertical axis in both is the price per unit weight ($/kg) of materials and products: It gives a common measure by which materials and products can be compared. The measure is a crude one but its great merit is that it is unambiguous, easily determined, and bears some relationship to value added. A product with a price/kg that is only two or three times that of the materials of which it is made is material-intensive and is sensitive to material costs; one with a price/kg that is 100 times that of its materials is insensitive to material\n \n 481\n \n CHAPTER 17:\n \n Forces for Change\n \n 106 Price per kg of engineering materials Diamond\n \n 105\n \n Platinum Gold\n \n 104 Exotics\n \n Approximate material price per unit mass ($/kg)\n \n 482\n \n Sapphire\n \n Iridium\n \n 103\n \n Beryllium Silver\n \n 102 PEEK\n \n Ti-alloys Ni-alloys Stainless steels Mg-alloys\n \n 10\n \n Metals Al-alloys\n \n 1\n \n Glass Structural steel Oil\n \n 10−1\n \n Fuels Coal\n \n 10−2\n \n Alloy steels C-steels Cast irons\n \n PTFE Silicones Polymers Epoxies Nylons PMMA\n \n WC-Co cermets\n \n Al-nitride\n \n CFRP\n \n W-carbide Boron carbide Silicon carbide\n \n Structural composites\n \n Technical ceramics and glasses\n \n GFRP\n \n Alumina\n \n EVA, PS PP, PE\n \n Pyrex Glass\n \n Typical cost of structural materials\n \n Construction materials Timber Brick Concrete\n \n MFA, 09\n \n FIGURE 17.2 The price per unit weight for materials.

The shaded band spans the range in which lies most of the material of which they are made. Products in the shaded band are material-intensive; those above it are not.\n \n 483\n \n 484\n \n CHAPTER 17:\n \n Forces for Change\n \n costs, and is probably performance-driven rather than cost-driven. On this scale the price per kg of a contact lens differs from that of a glass bottle by a factor of 105, even though both are made of almost the same glass; the cost per kg of a heart valve differs from that of a plastic bottle by a similar factor, even though both are made of polyethylene. There is obviously something to be learned here. Look first at the price per unit weight of materials (refer to Figure 17.2). The bulk “commodity” materials of construction and manufacture lie in the shaded band; they all cost between $0.05 and $20/kg. Construction materials like concrete, brick, timber, and structural steel lie at the lower end; high-tech materials like titanium alloys lie at the upper. Polymers span a similar range: polyethylene at the bottom, polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) near the top. Composites lie higher, with GFRP at the bottom and CFRP at the top of the range. Engineering ceramics, at present, lie higher still, though this is changing as production increases. Only the low-volume “exotic” materials lie much above the shaded band. The price per kg of products (refer to Figure 17.3) shows a different distribution. Eight market sectors are shown, covering much of the manufacturing industry. The shaded band on this figure spans the cost of commodity materials, exactly as on the previous figure. Sectors and their products within the shaded band have the characteristic that material cost is a major fraction of product price: about 50% in civil construction, large marine structures, and some consumer packaging, falling to perhaps 20% as the top of the band is approached (family car—around 25%). The value added in converting material to product in these sectors is relatively low, but the market volume is large. These constraints condition the choice of materials: They must meet modest performance requirements at the lowest possible cost. Associated market sectors generate a driving force for improved processing of conventional materials in order to reduce cost without a loss of performance, or to increase reliability with no increase in cost. For these sectors, incremental improvements in well-tried materials are far more important than revolutionary research findings. Slight improvements in steels, in precision manufacturing methods, or in lubrication technology are quickly assimilated and used. The products in the upper half of the diagram are technically more sophisticated. The materials of which they are made account for less than 10%— sometimes less than 1%—of the price of the product. The value added to the material during manufacture is high. Product competitiveness is closely linked to material performance. Designers in these sectors have greater freedom in their choice of material and there is a readier acceptance of new materials with attractive property profiles. The market pull here is for\n \n 17.2 Market Pull and Science Push\n \n performance, with cost as a secondary consideration. These smaller-volume, higher-value-added sectors drive the development of new or improved materials with enhanced performance: materials that are lighter, or stiffer, or stronger, or tougher, or expand less, or conduct better—or all of these at once. The sectors have been ordered to form an ascending sequence, prompting the question: What does the horizontal axis measure? Many factors are involved here, one of which can be identified as “information content.” The technical knowledge involved in the manufacture of a contact lens or a heart valve is clearly greater than that needed to make a water glass or a plastic bottle. The sectors on the left make few demands on the materials they employ; those on the right push materials to their limits, and at the same time demand the highest reliability. These features make them information-intensive. But there are other factors: market size, competition (or lack of it), perceived value, advertising, fashion, and taste. For this reason, the diagram should not be over-interpreted: It is a help in structuring information, but it is not a quantitative tool. The manufacturing industry, even in times of recession, has substantial resources; it is in the interests of governments to support their needs. Market pull is ultimately the strongest force for change.\n \n New science: Curiosity-driven research Curiosity may kill cats, but it is the oxygen of innovative engineering. Technically advanced countries sustain the flow of new ideas by supporting research in three kinds of organization: universities, government laboratories, and industrial research laboratories. Some of the scientists and engineers working in these institutions are given the freedom to pursue ideas that may have no immediate economic objective but may evolve into the materials and manufacturing methods of future decades. Numerous nowcommercial materials started in this way. Aluminum, in the time of Napoleon III, was a scientific wonder—he commissioned a set of aluminum spoons for which he paid more than for those of solid silver. Titanium, more recently, has had a similar history. Amorphous (= noncrystalline) metals, now important in transformer technology and in recording heads of tape decks, were, for years, of only academic interest. Semiconductors and superconductors did not appear in response to market forces; it took longterm curiosity-driven research, rewarded in both cases by Nobel prizes, to reveal the principles on which they are based. Polyethylene was discovered by chemists studying the effect of pressure on chemical reactions, not by the sales or marketing departments of multinational corporations. History is dotted with examples of materials and processes that have developed from the inquisitiveness of individuals.\n \n 485\n \n 486\n \n CHAPTER 17:\n \n Forces for Change\n \n New materials, products of fundamental research, continue to emerge. Some are already entering commercial use, for others the potential is not yet clear. Some, at least, will provide opportunities for innovation; the best may create new markets. Monolithic ceramics, now produced in commercial quantities, offer high hardness, chemical stability, wear resistance, and resistance to extreme temperatures. Their use as substrates for microcircuits is established, their use in wear-resistant applications is growing, and their use in heat engines is being explored. The emphasis in the development of composite materials is shifting toward those that can support loads at higher temperatures. Metal-matrix composites (example: aluminum containing particles or fibers of siliconcarbide) and intermetallic-matrix composites (titanium-aluminide or molybdenum-disilicide containing silicon-carbide, for instance) can do this. So, potentially, can ceramic-matrix composites (alumina with silicon carbide fibers), though the extreme brittleness of these materials requires new design techniques. Metallic foams, up to 90% less dense than the parent metal, promise light, stiff sandwich structures competing with composites. Aerogels, ultra-low–density foams, provide exceptionally low thermal conductivities. New bio-materials, designed to be implanted in the human body, have structures to which growing tissue will bond without rejection. New polymers that can be used at temperatures up to 350°C allow plastics to replace metals in even more applications—the inlet manifold of the automobile engine is an example. New elastomers are flexible but strong and tough; they allow better seals, elastic hinges, and resilient coatings. Techniques for producing functionally graded materials can give tailored gradients of composition and structure through a component to make it corrosion resistant on the outer surface, tough in the middle, and hard on the inner surface. Nanostructured materials promise unique mechanical, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties. “Intelligent” materials that can sense and report their condition (via embedded sensors) allow safety margins to be reduced. Selfhealing materials have the capacity to repair service damage without human intervention. Developments in rapid prototyping now permit single complex parts to be made quickly without dies or molds from a wide range of materials. Micronscale fabrication methods create miniature electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). New techniques of surface engineering allow the alloying, coating, or heat-treating of a thin surface layer of a component, modifying its properties to enhance its performance. They include laser hardening, coatings of well-adhering polymers and ceramics, ion implantation, and even the deposition of ultra-hard carbon films with a structure and properties like those of diamond. New adhesives displace rivets and spot-welds; the\n \n 17.4 Product Liability and Service Provision\n \n glue-bonded automobile is a real possibility. And new techniques of mathematical modeling and process control allow much tighter control of composition and structure in manufacture, reducing cost and increasing reliability and safety. All these and many more are now realities. They have the potential to enable new designs and to stimulate redesign of products that already have a market, increasing their market share. The designer must stay alert.\n \n 17.3 GROWING POPULATION AND WEALTH AND MARKET SATURATION The world’s population continues to grow (see sector 1 in Figure 17.1). Much of this population is also growing in wealth. This wealthier population consumes more products, and as wealth increases they want still more. But thus far the growth of the world’s product-producing capacity has grown faster still, with the result that, in developed and developing countries, product markets are saturated. If you want a product—a mobile phone, a refrigerator, a car—you don’t have to stand in line with the hope of getting the only one in the store or put your name on a three-year waiting list (as was the case within living memory throughout Europe). Instead, an eager salesperson guides you through the task of selecting, from an array of near-identical products with near-identical prices, the one you think you want. This has certain consequences. One is the massive and continuing growth in consumption of energy and material resources. This, as a force for change in material selection, was the subject of Chapter 15. Another arises because in a saturated market the designer must seek new ways to attract the consumer. The more traditional reliance on engineering qualities to sell a product are replaced (or augmented) by visual qualities, associations, and carefully managed perceptions created by industrial design. This, too, influences material and process choice; it was the subject of Chapter 16.\n \n 17.4 PRODUCT LIABILITY AND SERVICE PROVISION Legislation now requires that, if a product has a fault, it must be recalled and the fault rectified (see sector 2 in Figure 17.1). Product recalls are exceedingly expensive and they damage the company’s image. The higher up the chart shown in Figure 17.3 we go, the more catastrophic a fault becomes. When you buy a packet of six ballpoint pens, it is no great tragedy if one doesn’t write properly. The probability ratio 1:6, in a Gaussian distribution, is one standard deviation or “1-sigma.” But would you fly in a plane designed\n \n 487\n \n 488\n \n CHAPTER 17:\n \n Forces for Change\n \n on a “1-sigma” basis? Safety-critical systems today are designed on a “6-sigma” reliability rating, meaning that the probability that the component or assembly will fail to meet specification is less than three parts in a million. This impacts the way materials are produced and processed. Reliability and reproducibility require sophisticated process control and that every aspect of their production is monitored and verified. Clean steels (steels with greatly reduced inclusion account), aluminum alloys with tight composition control, real-time feedback control of processing, new nondestructive testing for quality and integrity, and random sample testing all help ensure that quality is maintained. This pressure on manufacturers to assume full-life responsibility for their products causes them to consider taking maintenance and replacement out of the hands of the consumer and doing it themselves. In this way they can monitor product use and replace the product, taking back the original, not when it is worn out but when it is optimal to recondition and redeploy it. The producers no longer sell a product; they sell a service. In common with many others, my university does not own copying machines, though we have many. Instead it has a contract with a provider to guarantee a certain copying service—the provision of “copied pages per week,” you might call it. This changes the economic boundary conditions for the designer of the copier. The objective is no longer that of building copiers with the most features at the lowest price, but rather building ones that will, over the long term, provide copies at the lowest cost per page. The result: a priority to design for ease of replacement, reconditioning, and standardization of materials and components between models. The best copier is no longer the one that lasts the longest; it’s the one that is the cheapest for the maker to recondition, upgrade, or replace. This is not an isolated example. Aircraft engine makers now adopt a strategy of providing “power by the hour.” It is the same strategy that makers of copiers use: They own the engines, monitor their use, and replace them on the plane at the point at which the tradeoff between cost, reliability, and powerproviding capacity is optimal. Legislation exerts other forces for change. Manufacturers must now register the large number of restricted substances that are contained in the products they make or used in their manufacture. If the level of use exceeds a threshold, the material must be replaced. The list includes the metals cadmium, lead, and mercury, along with a large number of their compounds and chemicals, many of them used in material processing. So the restrictions exert forces for change both in material choice and in the way that the material is shaped, joined, and finished.\n \n 17.5 Miniaturization and Multifunctionality\n \n 17.5 MINIATURIZATION AND MULTIFUNCTIONALITY Today we make increasing use of precision mechanical engineering at the micron scale (see sector 3 in Figure 17.1). CD and DVD players require the ability to position the read-head with micron precision. Hard disk drives are yet more impressive: Think of storing and retrieving a gigabyte of information on a few square millimeters. MEMS (miniature electro-mechanical systems), now universal as the accelerometers that trigger automobile airbags, rely on micron-thick cantilever beams that bend under inertial forces in a (very) sudden stop. MEMS technology promises much more. There are now video projectors that work not by projecting light through an LCD screen but by reflecting it from arrays of electrostatically actuated mirrors, each a few microns across, allowing much higher light intensities. There are even studies of mechanical microprocessors using bi-stable mechanical switching that could compete with semiconductor switching for information processing. The smaller you make the components of a device, the greater the functionality you can pack into it. Think (as we already did in Section 8.6) of mobile phones, PDAs, MP3 players, and above all portable computers so small that they fit in a jacket pocket. All these involve components with mechanical functions: protection, positioning, actuation, sensing, casings, hard disks, keyboards, thermal and shock protection. Microengineering no longer means Swiss watches. It means almost all the devices with which we interact continuously throughout a working day. Miniaturization imposes new demands on materials. As devices become smaller, it is mechanical failures that become design-limiting. In the past the allowable size and weight of casings, connectors, keypads, motors, and actuators gave plenty of margin of safety on bending stiffness, strength, wear rates, and corrosion rates. But none of these scale linearly with size. If we measure scale by a characterizing length L, bending stiffness scales as L3 or L4, strength as L2 or L3, and wear and corrosion, if measured by fractional loss of section per unit time, scales as 1/L. Thus the smaller the device, the greater the demands placed on the materials of which it is made. That is the bad news. The better news is that, since the device is smaller, the amount of material needed to make it is less. Add to that the fact that consumers want small size with powerful functionality and will pay more for it. The result: Expensive, high-performance materials that would not merit consideration for bulky products become viable for this new, miniaturized generation. Think of the armature of an airbag actuator: it weighs about 1 mg, and 1 mg of almost any material—even gold—costs, in it raw state, very little.\n \n 489\n \n 490\n \n CHAPTER 17:\n \n Forces for Change\n \n So, it seems, material cost no longer limits choice. It is processing that imposes restrictions. Making micron-scale products with precision presents new processing challenges. The watchmakers of Switzerland perfected tools to meet their needs, but the digital watch decimated the mechanical watch business—their methods were not transferable to the new form of miniaturization, which requires mass production at low cost. The makers of microprocessors, on the other hand, had already coped with this sort of scaling-down in nonmechanical systems—their microfabrication methods, rather than those of the watchmaker, have been adapted to make micromachines. But adopting these methods means that the menu of materials is drastically curtailed. In their present form these processes can shape silicon, silicon oxides, nitride and carbide, thin films of copper and gold, but little else. The staple materials of large-scale engineering—carbon and alloy steels, aluminum alloys, polyolefins, glass—do not appear. The current challenge is to broaden the range of microfabrication processes to allow a wider choice of materials to be manipulated.\n \n 17.6 CONCERN FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR THE INDIVIDUAL We live in a carbon-burning economy. Energy from fossil fuels has given the developed countries high standards of living and made them wealthy. Other, much more populous countries aspire to the same standards of life and wealth and are well-advanced in acquiring them. Yet the time is approaching when burning hydrocarbons will no longer meet energy needs, and even if it could the burden it places on the natural environment will force limits to be set (see sector 4 in Figure 17.1). Short-term measures to address this and the implications these have for material selection were the subject of Chapter 15. The changes necessary to allow longer-term sustainable development will have to be much more far-reaching, changing the ways in which we manufacture, transport ourselves and our goods, and live, and having a major impact on the way materials, central to all of these, are used. It is one thing to point out that this force for change is a potent one, but quite another to predict what its consequences will be. It is possible to point to fuel-cell technology, energy from natural sources, and safe nuclear power (all with material challenges) as ways forward, but—in the sense we are discussing here—even these are short-term solutions. Remember the figure cited in the introduction to Chapter 15: At a global growth rate of 3% per year, we will mine, process, and dispose of more “stuff” in the next 25 years than in the entire industrial history of humans. The question that has no present answer is this: How can a world population growing at about 3% per year, living in countries with economic growth rates of between 2% and 20% per\n \n 17.6 Concern for the Environment and for the Individual\n \n year, continue to meet its aspirations with zero—or even negative—growth in consumption of energy and materials? Wealth has another dimension: It enables resources to be allocated to health care, for which there is a growing demand in a population with an increasing lifespan. A surprisingly large fraction of the organs in a human body perform predominantly mechanical functions: teeth for cutting and grinding, bone to support structural loads, joints to allow articulation, the heart to pump blood, and arteries to carry it under pressure to the extremities of the body, muscle to actuate, skin to provide flexible protection. Aging or accidental damage frequently causes one or more of these to malfunction. Because there are mechanical, it is possible, in principle, to replace them. One way to do so is to use real body parts, but the shear number of patients requiring such treatment and the ethical and other difficulties of using human replacements drives efforts to develop artificial substitutes. Man-made teeth and bone implants, hip and knee joint replacements, artificial artery and skin, even hearts, exist already and are widely used. But at present they are exceedingly expensive, limiting their availability, and for the most part they are only crude substitutes for the real thing. There is major incentive for change here, stimulating research into affordable materials for artificial organs of all types. Studies show that in a world that is aging the usability of many products and services is unnecessarily challenging to people, whether they are young or old, able-bodied or less able. Until recently the goal of many designers was to appeal to the youth market (meaning the 15–35 age group) as the mainstay of their business, thereby developing products that often could not be used by others. Astute manufacturers have perceived the problem and have sought to redesign their products and services to make them accessible to a wider clientele. The U.S. company OXO has seen sales of its Good Grips range of kitchen and garden tools grow by 50% year after year, and the U.K. supermarket Tesco has added thousands of Internet customers by getting rid of clever but confusing graphics on its website and instead making its services quick to download and the website simple and intuitive to navigate. In this way they include a wider spectrum of people in online shopping. There is a powerful business case for inclusive design—design to ensure that products and services address the needs of the widest possible audience. The social case is equally compelling—at present many people are denied use of electronic and other products because they are unable to understand how to use them or lack the motor skills to do so. All products exclude some users, sometimes deliberately—the childproof medication bottle for instance—but more usually the exclusion is unintended and unnecessary. Many services rely on the use of products for\n \n 491\n \n 492\n \n CHAPTER 17:\n \n Forces for Change\n \n their delivery, so unusable products deny people access to them too. Video recorders are the standing joke of poor usability, regularly derided in reviews. A much larger number of contemporary products exclude those with disability—limited sight, hearing, physical mobility or strength, or mental acuity. Countering design exclusion is a growing priority of government and is increasingly seen as important by product makers. This thinking influences material choice, changing the constraints and objectives for their selection. The use of materials that, through color or feel, communicate the function of a control, give good grip, insulate, or protect, become priorities.\n \n 17.7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Powerful forces drive the development of new and improved materials, encourage substitution, and modify the way in which materials are produced and used. Market forces and military prerogatives, historically the most influential, remain the strongest. The ingenuity of research scientists, too, drives change by revealing a remarkable spectrum of new materials with exciting possibilities, though the time it takes to develop and commercialize them is long: typically 15 years from laboratory to marketplace. Today additional new drivers influence material development and use. Increasing wealth creates markets for ever more sophisticated products. The trend to products that are smaller in size, lighter in weight, and have greater functionality makes increasing demands on the mechanical properties of the materials used to make them. Greater insistence on product reliability and safety, with the manufacturer held liable for failures or malfunctions, requires materials with consistently reproducible properties and processes that are tightly controlled. Concern for the impact of industrial growth on the natural environment introduces the new objective of selecting materials in such a way as to minimize that impact. And the perception that many products exclude users by their complexity and difficulty of use drives a reassessment of the way in which they are designed and the choice of materials to make them. The result is that products that were seen as optimal yesterday are no longer optimal today. There is always scope for reassessing designs and the choice of materials to implement them.\n \n 17.8 FURTHER READING Defence and aerospace materials and structures.

Materials\n \n WAYS OF CHECKING AND ESTIMATING DATA The value of a database of material properties depends on its precision and its completeness—in short, on its quality. One way of maintaining or enhancing its quality is to subject its contents to validating procedures. The property range checks and dimensionless correlations, described below, provide powerful tools for doing this. The same procedures fill a second function: providing estimates for missing data, essential when no direct measurements are available.\n \n Property ranges Each property of a given class of materials has a characteristic range. A convenient way of presenting the information is as a table in which a low (L) and a high (H) value are stored, identified by the material family and class. An example listing Young’s modulus, E, is shown in Table A.12, in which EL is the lower limit and EH the upper limit. All properties have characteristic ranges like these. The range becomes narrower if the classes are made more restrictive. For purposes of checking and estimation, described in a moment, it is helpful to break down the family of metals into classes of cast irons, steels, aluminum alloys, magnesium alloys, titanium alloys, copper alloys, and so on. Similar subdivisions for polymers (thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers) and for ceramics and\n \n Table A.12 Ranges of Young’s Modulus, E, for Broad Material Classes Material class All solids Classes of solid Metals: ferrous Metals: nonferrous Technical ceramics* Glasses Polymers: thermoplastic Polymers: thermosets Polymers: elastomers Polymeric foams Composites: metal-matrix Composites: polymer-matrix Woods: parallel to grain Woods: perpendicular to grain\n \n EL (GPa) 0.00001 70 4.6 91 47 0.1 2.5 0.0005 0.00001 81 2.5 1.8 0.1\n \n EH (GPa) 1,000 220 570 1,000 83 4.1 10 0.1 2 180 240 34 18\n \n * Technical ceramics are dense, monolithic ceramics such as SiC, Al2O3, ZrO2, and so on.\n \n Ways of Checking and Estimating Data\n \n glasses (engineering ceramics, whiteware, silicate glasses, minerals) increase resolution here also.\n \n Correlations between material properties Materials that are stiff have high melting points. Solids with low densities have high specific heats. Metals with high thermal conductivities have high electrical conductivities. These rules of thumb describe correlations between two or more material properties that can be expressed more quantitatively as limits for the values of dimensionless property groups. They take the form CL &lt; P1 P2 n &lt; CH\n \n (A.1)\n \n CL &lt; P1 P2 n P3 m &lt; CH\n \n (A.2)\n \n or\n \n (or larger groupings), where P1, P2, P3 are material properties, n and m are powers (usually −1, −1/2, +1/2, or +1), and C L and C H are dimensionless constants—the lower and upper limits between which the values of the property group lies. The correlations exert tight constraints on the data, giving the “patterns” of property envelopes that appear on the material selection charts. An example is the relationship between expansion coefficient, α (units: K−1), and the melting point, Tm (units: K) or, for amorphous materials, the glass temperature, Tg: C L ≤ α Tm ≤ C H\n \n (A.3a)\n \n CL ≤ α Tg ≤ CH\n \n (A.3b)\n \n a correlation with the form of Equation (A.1). Values for the dimensionless limits CL and CH for this group are listed in Table A.13 for a number of material classes. The values span a factor of 2 to 10 rather than the factor of 10 to 100 of the property ranges. There are many such correlations. They form the basis of a hierarchical scheme for data checking and estimating (one used in preparing the charts in this book), described next.\n \n Data checking Data checks proceed in three steps. Each datum is first associated with a material class or, at a higher level of checking, with a subclass. This identifies the values of the property range and correlation limits against which it will be checked. The datum is then compared with the range limits L and H for that class and property. If it lies within the range limits, it is accepted; if it does not, it is flagged for checking.\n \n 521\n \n 522\n \n Appendix A:\n \n Data for Engineering Materials\n \n Table A.13 Limits for the Groups αTm and αTg for Broad Material Classes Correlation* CL &lt; αTm&lt; CH All solids Classes of solid Metals: ferrous Metals: nonferrous Fine ceramics* Glasses Polymers: thermoplastic Polymers: thermosets Polymers: elastomers Polymeric foams Composites: metal-matrix Composites: polymer-matrix Woods: parallel to grain Woods: perpendicular to grain\n \n CL (× 10–3)\n \n CH (× 10–3)\n \n 0.1\n \n 56\n \n 13 2 6 0.3 18 11 35 16 10 0.1 2 6\n \n 27 21 24 3 35 41 56 37 20 10 4 17\n \n * For amorphous solids, the melting point, Tm , is replaced by the glass temperature, Tg.\n \n Why bother with such low-level stuff? Because it provides a sanity check. The commonest error in handbooks and other compilations of material or process properties is that of a value expressed in the wrong units or, for less obvious reasons, in error by one or more orders of magnitude (slipped decimal point, for instance). Range checks catch errors of this sort. If a demonstration of this is needed, it can be found by applying them to the contents of almost any standard reference data-book; none among those we have tried has passed without errors. In the third step, each of the dimensionless groups of properties like the group in Table A.13 is formed in turn, and compared with the range bracketed by the limits CL and CH. If the value lies within its correlation limits, it is accepted; if not, it is checked. Correlation checks are more discerning than range checks and catch subtler errors, allowing the quality of the data to be further enhanced.\n \n Data estimation The relationships have another, equally useful, function. There remain gaps in our knowledge of material properties. The fracture toughness of many materials has not yet been measured, nor has the electric breakdown potential; even moduli are not always known. The absence of a datum for a material would falsely eliminate it from a screening exercise that used that property, even though the material might be a viable candidate. This difficulty is avoided by\n \n Further Reading\n \n using the correlation and range limits to estimate a value for the missing datum, adding a flag to alert the user that it is an estimate. In estimating property values, the procedure used for checking is reversed: The dimensionless groups are used first because they are the more accurate. They can be surprisingly good. As an example, consider estimating the expansion coefficient, α, of polycarbonate from its glass temperature, Tg. Inverting Equation (A.3b) gives the estimation rule: CL C ≤ α≤ H Tg Tg\n \n (A.4)\n \n Inserting values of CL and CH from Table A.13, and the value Tg = 420 K for a particular sample of polycarbonate gives the mean estimate  α = 63 × 10−3 K−1\n \n (A.5)\n \n The reported value for polycarbonate is α = 54−62 × 10−3 K−1 The estimate is within 9% of the mean of the measured values, perfectly adequate for screening purposes. That it is an estimate must not be forgotten, however: If thermal expansion is crucial to the design, better data or direct measurements are essential. Only when the potential of the correlations is exhausted are the property ranges invoked. They provide a crude first estimate of the value of the missing property, far less accurate than the correlations but still useful in providing guide values for screening.\n \n FURTHER READING Ashby, M.F.

There is increasing emphasis on materials efficiency—design that uses materials effectively and with as little damage to the environment as possible. All this takes place in a computer-based environment; teaching, too, draws increasingly on computerbased tools. This new edition has been comprehensively revised and reorganized to address these. The presentation has been enhanced and simplified; the figures, many of them new, have been redrawn in full color; worked intext examples illustrate methods and results in chapters that are not themselves collections of case studies; and additional features and supplements have been added. The key changes are outlined next.<br>\n <br>\n Key changes ■<br>\n <br>\n ■<br>\n <br>\n ■<br>\n <br>\n ■<br>\n <br>\n ■<br>\n <br>\n ■<br>\n <br>\n Chapter 1, Introduction, has been completely rewritten and illustrated to develop the history of materials and the evolution of materials in engineering. Engineering Design, introduced in Chapter 2, has been edited, with a full revision of all figures. Material Properties and Property Charts—a unique feature of the book, which appear in Chapters 3 and 4, have been redrawn in full color. Chapter 5 and 6—the central chapters that describe and illustrate selection methods—have been extensively revised with new explanations of the essential selection strategy. Chapters 7 and 8 (Multiple Constraints) have been revised, with in-text examples and more illuminating case studies. Chapters 9 and 10 (Materials and Shape) have been rewritten for greater clarity, with numerous in-text examples in Chapter 9.<br>\n <br>\n xiii<br>\n <br>\n xiv<br>\n <br>\n Features of the Fourth Edition<br>\n <br>\n ■<br>\n <br>\n ■<br>\n <br>\n ■<br>\n <br>\n ■<br>\n <br>\n ■ ■<br>\n <br>\n ■<br>\n <br>\n Chapters 11 and 12, Hybrid Materials, represent a further development of what was in the earlier edition, with a new development of the treatment of sandwich structures and with enhanced case studies. Chapters 13 and 14, Processing, contain sections and figures that emphasize the influence of processing on properties. Chapter 15, Materials and the Environment, is revised, with improved examples and links to the new information.1 Chapter 16, Industrial Design, is updated and linked to the second edition of the related text2 on this subject. Chapter 17, Forces for Change, has been updated. Appendices with Tables of Materials Properties, Useful Solutions, Indices, and Data Sources are updated, enlarged and reillustrated. The final appendix contains Exercises that are listed by chapter number.<br>\n <br>\n Material selection charts Full color versions of a number of the Material Selection Charts presented in this book are available.

Ashby, ButterworthHeinemann, ISBN 978-1-85617-608-8. 2 Materials and Design—The art and science of materials selection in Product Design, 2nd edition (2009), by M.F. Ashby and K. Johnson, Butterworth-Heinemann, ISBN 978-1-85617-497-8.<br>\n <br>\n Features of the Fourth Edition<br>\n <br>\n The CES EduPack The CES EduPack is a widely used software package that implements the methods developed here. The book does not rely on the software, but the learning experience is enhanced by using the two together to create an exciting teaching environment that stimulates exploration, self-teaching, and design innovation. For further information, see the last page of this book or visit http://www.grantadesign.com/education/.<br>\n <br>\n xv<br>\n <br>\n Preface<br>\n <br>\n Materials, of themselves, affect us little; it is the way we use them which influences our lives. Epictetus, AD 50–100, Discourses, Book 2, Chapter 5<br>\n <br>\n Materials influenced lives in Epictetus’ time and continue to do so today. In his day, the number of materials was small; today it is vast. The opportunities for innovation that materials offer now are equally immense. But advance is possible only if a procedure exists for making a rational choice from the materials on this great menu, and—if they are to be used—a way of identifying ways to shape, join, and finish them. This book develops a systematic procedure for selecting materials and processes, leading to the subset that best matches the requirements of a design. It is unique in the way that the information it contains has been structured. The structure gives rapid access to data and allows the user great freedom in exploring potential choices. The method is implemented in software* to provide greater flexibility. The approach here emphasizes design with materials rather than materials “science,” although the underlying science is used whenever possible to help with the structuring of selection criteria. The first six chapters require little prior knowledge: A first-year grasp of materials and mechanics is enough. The chapters dealing with shape and multiobjective selection are a little more advanced but can be omitted on a first reading. As far as possible, the book integrates materials selection with other aspects of design; the relationships with the stages of design and optimization and with the mechanics of material, are developed throughout. At the teaching level, the book is intended as a text for third- and fourth-year engineering courses on Materials for Design: A 6- to 10-lecture unit can be based on Chapters 1 through 6, 13, and 14; a full 20-lecture course, with project work using the associated software, will require use of the entire book. * The CES Edu materials and process selection platform is a product of Granta Design (www.grantadesign.com).<br>\n <br>\n xi<br>\n <br>\n xii<br>\n <br>\n Preface<br>\n <br>\n Beyond this, the book is intended as a reference of lasting value. The method, the charts, and the tables of performance indices have application in real problems of materials and process selection; and the table of data and the catalog of “useful solutions” (Appendices A and B) are particularly helpful in modeling—an essential ingredient in optimal design. The reader can use the content (and the software) at increasing levels of sophistication as his or her experience grows, starting with the material indices developed in the book’s case studies and graduating to the modeling of new design problems, leading to new material indices and penalty functions, as well as new—and perhaps novel—choices of material. This continuing education aspect is helped by the “Further readings” at the end of each chapter and Appendix E—a set of exercises covering all aspects of the text. Useful reference material is assembled in Appendices A, B, C, and D. As in any other book, the contents in this one are protected by copyright. Generally, it is an infringement to copy and distribute materials from a copyrighted source. However, the best way to use the charts that are a central feature of the book, for readers to have a clean copy on which they can draw, try out alternative selection criteria, write comments, and so forth; presenting the conclusion for a selected exercise is often most easily done in the same way. Although the book itself is copyrighted, instructors or readers are authorized to make unlimited copies of the charts and to reproduce these for teaching purposes, provided a full reference to their source is given.<br>\n <br>\n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Many colleagues have been generous with discussion, criticism, and constructive suggestions.

Every manufactured thing, from the most lyrical of ladies’ hats to the greasiest of gearboxes, qualifies, in some sense or other, as a design. It can mean yet more. Nature, to some, is divine design; to others it is design by natural selection. The reader will agree that it is necessary to narrow the field, at least a little. This book is about mechanical design and the role of materials in it. Mechanical components have mass; they carry loads; they conduct heat and electricity; they are exposed to wear and to corrosive environments; they are made of one or more materials; they have shape; and they must be manufactured. The book describes how these activities are related. Materials have had limited design since man first made clothes, built shelters, and waged wars. They still do. But materials and processes to shape them are developing faster now than at any time in history; the challenges and opportunities they present are greater than ever before. This book develops a strategy for confronting such challenges and seizing those opportunities.<br>\n <br>\n 1.2 MATERIALS IN DESIGN Design is the process of translating a new idea or a market need into the detailed information from which a product can be manufactured. Each of its stages requires decisions about the materials of which the product is to be made and the process for making it. Normally, the choice of material is dictated by the design. But sometimes it is the other way around: The new product, or the evolution of the existing one, was suggested or made possible by a new material.<br>\n <br>\n 1.2 Materials in Design<br>\n <br>\n The number of materials available to engineers is vast: 160,000 or more. Although standardization strives to reduce the number, the continuing appearance of new materials with novel and exploitable properties expands the options further. How, then, do engineers choose, from this vast menu, the material best suited to their purpose? Do they rely on their experience? In the past that was how it was done, passing on this precious commodity to apprentices who, much later in their lives, might themselves assume the role of in-house materials guru. There is no question of the value of experience. But many things have changed in the world of engineering, and all of them work against the success of this model. There is the drawn-out time scale of apprentice-based learning. There is job mobility, meaning that the guru who is here today is usually gone tomorrow. And there is the rapid evolution of materials information, as already mentioned. A strategy that relies on experience is not in tune with today’s computer-based environment. We need a systematic procedure— one with steps that can be taught quickly, that is robust in the decisions it reaches, that allows computer implementation, and that is compatible with the other established tools of engineering design. The choice of material cannot be made independently of the choice of process by which the material is to be shaped, joined, and finished. Cost enters the equation, both in the choice of material and in the way the material is processed. So, too, does the influence of material usage on the environment in which we live. And it must be recognized that good engineering design alone is not enough to sell products. In almost everything from home appliances to automobiles and aircraft, the form, texture, feel, color, beauty, and meaning of the product—the satisfaction it gives the person who owns or uses it—are important. This aspect, known confusingly as industrial design, is one that, if neglected, can lose markets. Good design works; excellent design also gives pleasure. Design problems are almost always open-ended. They do not have a unique or “correct” solution, though some solutions will clearly be better than others. They differ from the analytical problems used in teaching mechanics, or structures, or thermodynamics, which generally do have single, correct answers. So the first tool a designer needs is an open mind: a willingness to consider all possibilities. But a net cast widely draws in many different fish. A procedure is necessary for selecting the excellent from the merely good. This book deals with the materials aspects of the design process. It develops a methodology that, properly applied, gives guidance through the forest of complex choices the designer faces. The ideas of material and process attributes are introduced. They are mapped on material and process selection charts that show the lay of the land, so to speak, and that simplify the initial<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 1:<br>\n <br>\n Introduction<br>\n <br>\n survey for potential candidate materials. Real life always involves conflicting objectives—minimizing mass while at the same time minimizing cost is an example—requiring the use of trade-off methods. The interaction between material and shape can be built into the method. Taken together, these suggest schemes for expanding the boundaries of material performance by creating hybrids—combinations of two or more materials, shapes, and configurations with unique property profiles. None of this can be implemented without data for material properties and process attributes: Ways to find them are described. The role of aesthetics in engineering design is discussed. The forces driving change in the materials world are surveyed, the most obvious of which is the force dealing with environmental concerns. The Appendices contain additional useful information. The methods lend themselves readily to implementation as computer-based tools; one, the CES Edu materials selection platform,1 is used for many of the case studies and figures in this book. They offer, too, potential for interfacing with tools for computer-aided design, finite element analysis, optimization routines, and product data management software. All this is found in the following chapters, with case studies illustrating applications. But first, a little history.<br>\n <br>\n 1.3 THE EVOLUTION OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS Throughout history, materials have had limited design. The ages of man are named for the materials he used: stone, bronze, iron. And when a man died, the materials he treasured were buried with him: Tutankhamun in his enameled sarcophagus, Agamemnon with his bronze sword and mask of gold, Viking chieftains in their burial ships—each treasure representing the high technology of their day. If these men had lived and died today, what would they have taken with them? Their titanium watch, perhaps; their carbon-fiber–reinforced tennis racquet; their metal-matrix composite mountain bike; their shape-memory alloy eyeglass frame with lenses coated with diamond-like carbon; their polyether-ethyl-ketone crash helmet; their carbon nanotube reinforced iPod? This is not the age of one material; it is the age of an immense range of materials. There has never been an era in which their evolution was faster and the range of their properties more varied. The menu of materials has expanded so rapidly that designers who left college 20 years ago can be forgiven for not knowing that many of them exist. But not to know is, for the 1<br>\n <br>\n Granta Design Ltd., Cambridge, U.K.—www.grantadesign.com.<br>\n <br>\n 1.3 The Evolution of Engineering Materials<br>\n <br>\n designer, risking disaster. Innovative design often means the imaginative exploitation of the properties offered by new or improved materials. And for the man on the street, the schoolboy even, not to know is to miss one of the great developments of our age: the age of advanced materials. This evolution and its increasing pace are illustrated on the cover page and, in more detail, in Figure 1.1. The materials of prehistory (before 10,000 BC, the Stone Age) were ceramics and glasses, natural polymers, and composites. Weapons—always the peak of technology—were made of wood and flint; buildings and bridges of stone and wood. Naturally occurring gold and silver were available locally and, through their rarity, assumed great influence as currency, but their role in technology was small. The development of rudimentary thermo-chemistry allowed the extraction of, first, copper and bronze, then iron (the Bronze Age, 4000–1000 BC and the Iron Age, 1000 BC–1620 AD), stimulating enormous advances in technology.2 Cast iron technology (1620s) established the dominance of metals in engineering; since then the evolution of steels (1850 onward), light alloys (1940s), and special alloys has consolidated their position. By the 1950s, “engineering materials” meant “metals.” Engineers were given courses in metallurgy; other materials were barely mentioned. There had, of course, been developments in the other classes of material. Improved cements, refractories, and glasses; and rubber, Bakelite, and polyethylene among polymers; but their share of the total materials market was small. Since 1950 all that has changed. The rate of development of new metallic alloys is now slow; demand for steel and cast iron has in some countries actually fallen.3 The polymer and composite industries, on the other hand, are growing rapidly, and projections of the growth of production of new high-performance ceramics suggests continued expansion here also. The material developments documented in the timeline of Figure 1.1 were driven by the desire for ever greater performance. One way of displaying this progression is by following the way in which properties have evolved on material-property charts. Figure 1.2 shows one of them—a strength-density chart. The oval bubbles plot the range of strength and density of materials; the larger colored envelopes enclose families. The chart is plotted for six successive points in historical time, ending with the present day. The materials of pre-history, shown in (a), cover only a tiny fraction of this strength-density 2 There is a cartoon on my office door, put there by a student, showing an aggrieved Celt confronting a swordsmith with the words, “You sold me this bronze sword last week and now I’m supposed to upgrade to iron!” 3 Do not, however, imagine that the days of steel are over. Steel production accounts for 90% of all world metal output, and its unique combination of strength, ductility, toughness, and low price makes it irreplaceable.<br>\n <br>\n 5<br>\n <br>\n 6<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 1:<br>\n <br>\n Introduction<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 1.1 A materials timeline.

By the time of the peak of the Roman Empire, around 50 BC (b), the area occupied by metals had expanded considerably, giving Rome critical advantages in weaponry and defense. The progress thereafter was slow: 1500 years later (c) not much has changed, although, significantly, cast iron started to appear. Even 500 years after that (d), expansion of the occupied area of the chart is small; aluminum only just starts to creep in. Then things accelerate. By 1945 the metals envelope has expanded considerably and a new envelope—that of synthetic polymers—occupies a significant position. Between then and the present day the expansion has been dramatic. The filled area now starts to approach some fundamental limits (not shown here) beyond which it is difficult to go. Any slice through material property space (we will encounter many) shows development like this. How can we expand the filled area further? And what would we gain if we did so? These are fascinating questions that will be answered in Chapters 13 and 14. We end this chapter, instead, with a look at the way material developments have been absorbed into products.<br>\n <br>\n 1.4 THE EVOLUTION OF MATERIALS IN PRODUCTS In this section we consider four examples of the changes in the way materials are used, each spanning about 100 years—not much more than a single life time. Bear in mind that in preceding generations, change was far slower. The horse-drawn carriage has a history of 2000 years; the automobile only a little more than 100. The kettle is the oldest of household appliances and the one found in more homes than any other; there is evidence (not entirely convincing) of a 4000-year-old kettle. Early kettles, heated directly over a fire, were of<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 1.3 Kettles: cast iron, bronze, polypropylene.<br>\n <br>\n 1.4 The Evolution of Materials in Products<br>\n <br>\n necessity made of materials that could conduct heat well and withstand exposure to an open flame: iron, copper, or bronze (Figure 1.3). Electric kettles, developed in the 1890s, had external heating elements to replace the flame, but were otherwise much like their predecessors. All that changed with the introduction, by the Swan company (1922), of a heating element sealed in a metal tube placed within the water chamber. The kettle body no longer had to conduct heat—indeed for safety and ease of use it was much better made of a thermal and electrical insulator. Today almost all kettles are made of plastic, allowing economic manufacture with great freedom of form and color. “Sweeping and dusting are homicidal practices: they consist of taking dust from the floor, mixing it in the atmosphere, and causing it to be inhaled by the inhabitants of the house. In reality it would be preferable to leave the dust alone where it was.”<br>\n <br>\n That was a doctor, writing about 100 years ago. More than any previous generation, the Victorians and their contemporaries in other countries worried about dust. They were convinced that it carried disease and that dusting merely dispersed it, when, as the doctor said, it became yet more infectious. Their response was to invent the vacuum cleaner (Figure 1.4). The vacuum cleaners of that time were human-powered. The materials were, by today’s standards, primitive. The cleaner was made almost entirely from natural materials: wood, canvas, leather, and rubber. The only metal parts<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 1.4 Vacuum cleaners: a hand-powered cleaner from 1880, the Electrolux cylinder cleaner of 1960, and the Dyson centrifugal cleaner of 2010.

It reflects the use of materials in that era. Even a car, in 1900, was mostly made of wood, leather, and rubber; only the engine and drive train had to be metal. The electric vacuum cleaner first appeared around 1908.4 By 1950 the design had evolved into the cylinder cleaner. Air flow was axial, drawn through the filter by an electric fan. One advance in design was, of course, the electrically driven air pump. But there were others: This cleaner is almost entirely made of metal—the case, the end-caps, the runners, and even the tube to suck up the dust are mild steel. Metals entirely replaced natural materials. Developments since then have been rapid, driven by the innovative use of new materials. Power and air flow rate are much increased, and dust separation is centrifugal rather than by filtration. This is made possible by higher power density in the motor reflecting improved magnetic materials. The casing is entirely polymeric, and makes extensive use of snap fasteners for rapid assembly. No metal is visible anywhere; even the straight part of the suction tube, which was metal in all earlier models, is now polypropylene. The optics of a camera are much older than the camera itself (Figure 1.5). Lenses capable of resolving the heavens (Galileo, 1600) or the microscopic (Hooke, 1665) predate the camera by centuries. The key ingredient, of course, was the ability to record the image (Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, 1814). Early cameras were made of wood and constructed with the care and finish of a cabinetmaker. They had well-ground glass lenses and, later, a metal aperture and shutter manufactured by techniques already well developed for watch- and clockmaking.<br>\n <br>\n 4 Inventors: Murray Spengler and William B. Hoover. The second name has become part of the English language, along with the names of such luminaries as John B. Stetson (the hat), S.F.B. Morse (the code), Leo Henrik Baikeland (Bakelite), and Thomas Crapper (the flush toilet).<br>\n <br>\n 1.4 The Evolution of Materials in Products<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 1.6 Aircraft: the Wright biplane of 1903, the Douglas DC3 of 1935, and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner of 2010.<br>\n <br>\n For the next 90 years photography was practiced by a specialized few. Invention of celluloid-backed film and the cheap box camera around 1900 moved it from a specialized to a mass market, with competition between camera makers to capture a share. Wood, canvas, and leather (with brass and steel only where essential) were quickly replaced by precision-engineered steel bodies and control mechanisms; then from the 1960s on, by aluminum, magnesium, or titanium for low weight, durability, and prestige. Digital technology fractionated the market further. High-end cameras now have optical systems with compound lenses combining glasses with tailored refractive indices, manufactured with the precision and electronic sophistication of scientific instruments. At the other end of the range, point-and-shoot cameras with molded polypropylene or ABS bodies, and acrylic or polycarbonate lenses fill a need. Perhaps the most dramatic example of the way material usage has changed is found in airframes. Early planes were made of low-density woods (spruce, balsa, and ply), steel wire,5 and silk. Wood remained the principal structural material of airframes well into the twentieth century, but as planes got larger it became less and less practical. The aluminum airframe, exemplified by the Douglas DC3, was the answer. It provided the high bending stiffness and strength at low weight necessary for scale-up and extended range. Aluminum remained the dominant structural material of civil airliners for the remainder of the twentieth century. By the end of the century, the pressure for greater fuel economy and lower carbon emissions had reached a level that made composites an increasingly attractive choice, despite their higher cost and greater technical challenge. The future of airframes is exemplified by Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner (80% carbon-fiber–reinforced plastic by volume), claimed to be 30% lighter per seat than competing aircraft. (See Figure 1.6.) All this has happened within one lifetime. Competitive design requires the innovative use of new materials and the clever exploitation of their special properties, both engineering and aesthetic. Many manufacturers of kettles, cleaners, and cameras failed to innovate and exploit; now they are extinct. That somber thought prepares us for the chapters that follow, in which we consider what they forgot: the optimum use of materials in design. 5<br>\n <br>\n “Piano wire”—drawn high-carbon-steel wire—was developed for harpsichords around 1350.<br>\n <br>\n 11<br>\n <br>\n 12<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 1:<br>\n <br>\n Introduction<br>\n <br>\n 1.5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS What do we learn? There is an acceleration in material development and of the ways in which materials are used in products. One of the drivers for change, certainly, is performance: The displacement of bronze by iron in weapons of the Iron Age, and that of wood by aluminum in airframes of the twentieth century, had their origins in the superior performance of the new materials. But performance is not the only factor. Economics exerts powerful pressures for change: the use of polymers in the jug kettle, the vacuum cleaner, and the cheap camera derives in part from the ease with which polymers can be molded to complex shapes. Technical change in other fields—digital imaging technology, for example—can force change in the way materials are chosen. And there are many more drivers for change that we will encounter in later chapters, among them a concern for the environment, restrictive legislation and directives, aesthetics, and taste. Engineering materials are evolving faster, and the choice is wider, than ever before. Examples of products in which a new material has captured a market are as common as, well, plastic bottles. Or aluminum cans. Or polycarbonate eyeglass lenses. Or carbon-fiber golf club shafts. It is important in the early stage of design, or of redesign, to examine the full materials menu, not rejecting options merely because they are unfamiliar. That is what this book is about.<br>\n <br>\n 1.6 FURTHER READING The history and evolution of materials Singer, C. et al. (1954–2001). A history of technology (21 volumes).

This does not mean that we ignore industrial design—pattern, color, texture, and (above all) consumer appeal—but that comes later. The optimum starting point in product development is good mechanical design, and the ways in which the selection of materials and processes contribute to it. Our aim is to develop a methodology for selecting materials and processes that is design-led; that is, it uses, as inputs, the functional requirements of the design. To do so we must first look briefly at the design process itself. Like most technical fields, mechanical design is encrusted with its own special jargon, some of it bordering on the incomprehensible. We need very little, but it cannot all be avoided. This chapter introduces some of the words and phrases—the vocabulary—of design, the stages in its implementation, and the ways in which materials selection links with these.<br>\n <br>\n 2.2 THE DESIGN PROCESS The starting point of a design is a market need or a new idea; the end point is the full specification of a product that fills the need or embodies the idea. A need must be identified before it can be met. It is essential to define the need precisely—that is, to formulate a need statement, often in this form: “A device is required to perform task X,” expressed as a set of design requirements. Writers on design emphasize that the need statement should be solution-neutral (that is, it should not imply how the task will be performed) to avoid narrow thinking constrained by preconceptions. Between the need statement and the product specification lie the stages shown in Figure 2.1: concept, embodiment, and detailed design, explained in a moment. The product itself is called a technical system. A technical system consists of subassemblies and components, put together in a way that performs the required task, as in the breakdown of Figure 2.2. It is like describing a cat (the system) as made up of one head, one body, one tail, four legs, and so on (the subassemblies), each composed of components: femurs, quadriceps, claws, fur. This decomposition is a useful way to analyze an existing design, but it is not of much help in the design process itself, that is, in devising new designs. Better, for this purpose, is one based on the ideas of systems analysis, which considers the inputs, flows, and outputs of information, energy, and materials, as in Figure 2.3. This design converts the inputs into the outputs. An electric motor, for example, converts electrical into mechanical energy; a forging press takes<br>\n <br>\n 2.2 The Design Process<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 2.1 The design flow chart.

This approach, when elaborated, helps structure thinking about alternative designs.<br>\n <br>\n and reshapes material; a burglar alarm collects information and converts it to noise. In this approach, the system is broken down into connected subsystems, each of which performs a specific function, as shown in Figure 2.3. The resulting arrangement is called the function structure or function decomposition of the system. It is like describing a cat as an appropriate linkage of a respiratory system, a cardio-vascular system, a nervous system, a digestive system, and so on. Alternative designs link the unit functions in alternative ways, combine functions, or split them. The function structure gives a systematic way of assessing design options. The design proceeds by developing concepts to perform the functions in the function structure, each based on a working principle. At this, the conceptual design stage, all options are open: The designer considers alternative concepts and the ways in which these might be separated or combined. The next stage, embodiment, takes the promising concepts and seeks to analyze their operation at an approximate level. This involves sizing the components and selecting materials that will perform properly in the ranges of stress, temperature, and environment suggested by the design requirements, examining the implications for performance and cost. The embodiment stage ends with a feasible layout, which is then passed to the detailed design stage. Here specifications for each component are drawn up. Critical components may be subjected to precise mechanical or thermal analysis. Optimization methods are applied to components and groups of components to maximize performance. A final choice of geometry and material is made and the methods of production are analyzed and costed. The stage ends with a detailed production specification.<br>\n <br>\n 2.2 The Design Process<br>\n <br>\n All that sounds well and good. If only it were so simple. The linear process suggested by Figure 2.1 obscures the strong coupling between the three stages. The consequences of choices made at the concept or the embodiment stages may not become apparent until the detail is examined. Iteration, looping back to explore alternatives, is an essential part of the design process. Think of each of the many possible choices that could be made as an array of blobs in design space, as shown in Figure 2.4. Here C1, C2... are possible concepts, and E1, E2... and D1, D2... are possible embodiments and detailed elaborations of them. The design process becomes one of creating paths and linking compatible blobs until a connection is made from the top (market need) to the bottom (product specification). Some trial paths have dead ends, some loop back. It is like finding a track across difficult terrain—it may be necessary to go back many times to go forward in the end. Once a path is found, it is always possible to make it look linear and logical (and many books do this), but the reality is more like Figure 2.4 than Figure 2.1.<br>\n <br>\n Market need: Design requirements<br>\n <br>\n C6 C2<br>\n <br>\n C5<br>\n <br>\n C3<br>\n <br>\n C4<br>\n <br>\n C1<br>\n <br>\n C7<br>\n <br>\n Concept E4<br>\n <br>\n E3<br>\n <br>\n E5 E6<br>\n <br>\n E1 E2<br>\n <br>\n D5<br>\n <br>\n D3 D1<br>\n <br>\n Detail D2<br>\n <br>\n E8<br>\n <br>\n Embodiment E7<br>\n <br>\n D4 D6<br>\n <br>\n Product specification<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 2.4 The convoluted path of design. Here the C-blobs represent concepts; the E-blobs, embodiments of the Cs; and the D-blobs, detailed realizations of the Es. The process is complete when a compatible path from “need” to “specification” can be identified. It is a devious path (the full red line) with back loops and dead ends (the broken lines). This creates the need for tools that allow fluid access to materials information at differing levels of breadth and detail.<br>\n <br>\n 19<br>\n <br>\n 20<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 2:<br>\n <br>\n The Design Process<br>\n <br>\n Thus a key part of design, and of selecting materials for it, is flexibility, the ability to explore alternatives quickly, keeping the big picture as well as the details in mind. Our focus in later chapters is on the selection of materials and processes, where exactly the same need arises. This requires some kind of mapping of the “universes” of materials and processes to allow quick surveys of alternatives while still providing detail when it is needed. The selection charts of Chapter 4 and the methods of Chapter 5 help do this. Described in the abstract, these ideas are not easy to grasp. An example will help—it comes in Section 2.6. First, a look at types of design.<br>\n <br>\n 2.3 TYPES OF DESIGN It is not always necessary to start, as it were, from scratch. Original design does: it involves a new idea or working principle (the ballpoint pen, the compact disc). New materials can offer new, unique combinations of properties that enable original design. Thus high-purity silicon enabled the transistor; high-purity glass, the optical fiber; high coercive-force magnets, the miniature earphone; solid-state lasers the compact disc. Sometimes the new material suggests the new product. Sometimes, instead, the new product demands the development of a new material: Nuclear technology drove the development of a series of new zirconium alloys and low-carbon stainless steels; space technology stimulated the development of light weight composites; gas turbine technology today drives development of high-temperature alloys and ceramic coatings. Original design sounds exciting, and it is. But most design is not like that. Almost all design is adaptive or developmental. The starting point is an existing product or product range. The motive for redesigning it may be to enhance performance, to reduce cost, or to adapt it to changing market conditions. Adaptive design takes an existing concept and seeks an incremental advance in performance through a refinement of the working principle. It, too, is often made possible by developments in materials: polymers replacing metals in household appliances; carbon fiber replacing wood in sports equipment. The appliance and the sports equipment markets are fast-moving and competitive. These markets have frequently been won (and lost) by the way in which the manufacturer has adapted the product by exploiting new materials. Finally, variant design involves a change of scale or dimension or detailing without a change of function or the method of achieving it: the scaling up of boilers, or of pressure vessels, or of turbines, for instance. Change of scale or circumstances of use may require change of material: Small boats are made of fiberglass, large ships are made of steel; small boilers are made of<br>\n <br>\n 2.4 Design Tools and Materials Data<br>\n <br>\n copper, large ones of steel; subsonic planes are made of one alloy, supersonic of another—all for good reasons, as detailed in later chapters.<br>\n <br>\n 2.4 DESIGN TOOLS AND MATERIALS DATA To implement the steps of Figure 2.1, use is made of design tools. They are shown as inputs, attached to the left of the main backbone of the design methodology in Figure 2.5. The tools enable the modeling and optimization of a design, easing the routine aspects of each phase. Function modelers suggest viable function structures. Configuration optimizers suggest or refine shapes. Geometric and 3D solid modeling packages allow visualization and create files that can be downloaded to numerically controlled prototyping and manufacturing systems. Optimization, DFM, DFA,1 and cost estimation software allows manufacturing aspects to be refined. Finite element (FE) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) packages allow precise mechanical and thermal analysis even when the geometry is complex, deformations are<br>\n <br>\n Market need: Design requirements Material data needs<br>\n <br>\n Design tools Function modeling Viability studies<br>\n <br>\n Concept<br>\n <br>\n Data for ALL materials, low precision and detail<br>\n <br>\n Embodiment<br>\n <br>\n Data for a SUBSET of materials, higher precision and detail<br>\n <br>\n Detail<br>\n <br>\n Data for ONE material, highest precision and detail<br>\n <br>\n Approximate analysis Geometric modeling Simulations methods Materials selector Cost modeling Component modeling Finite-element modeling (FEM) DFM, DFA<br>\n <br>\n Product specification<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 2.5 The design flow chart, showing how design tools and materials selection enter the procedure. Information about materials is needed at each stage, but at very different levels of breadth and precision. Iteration is part of the process. 1<br>\n <br>\n Design for Manufacture and Design for Assembly.<br>\n <br>\n 21<br>\n <br>\n 22<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 2:<br>\n <br>\n The Design Process<br>\n <br>\n large, and temperatures fluctuate. There is a natural progression in the use of the tools as the design evolves: approximate analysis and modeling at the conceptual stage; more sophisticated modeling and optimization at the embodiment stage; and precise (“exact”—but nothing is ever that) analysis at the detailed design stage. Tools for material selection play a major part in each stage of the design. The nature of the data needed in the early stages differs greatly in its level of precision and breadth from that needed later on (Figure 2.5, right). At the concept stage, the designer requires approximate property values, but for the widest possible range of materials. All options are open: A polymer may be the best choice for one concept, a metal for another, even though the function is the same. The problem, at this stage, is not precision and detail; it is breadth and speed of access: How can the vast range of data be presented to give the designer the greatest freedom in considering alternatives? At the embodiment stage the landscape has narrowed. Here we need data for a subset of materials, but at a higher level of precision and detail. These are found in more specialized handbooks and software that deal with a single class or subclass of materials—metals or just aluminum alloys, for instance. The risk now is that of losing sight of the bigger spread of materials to which we must return if the details don’t work out; it is easy to get trapped in a single line of thinking—a single set of “connections” in the sense of Figure 2.4—when other connections may offer a better solution. The final stage, that of detailed design, requires a still higher level of precision and detail, but for only one or a very few materials. Such information is best found in the datasheets issued by the material producers themselves and in detailed databases for restricted material classes. A given material (polyethylene, for instance) has a range of properties that derive from differences in the ways different producers make it. At the detailed design stage, a supplier must be identified, and the properties of their product used in the design calculations; a product from another supplier may differ. And sometimes even this is not good enough. If the component is a critical one (meaning that its failure could, in some sense or another, be disastrous), then it is prudent to conduct in-house tests to measure the critical properties, using a sample of the material that will be used to make the product itself. The materials input does not end with the establishment of production. Products fail in service, and failures contain information. It is an imprudent manufacturer who does not collect and analyze data on failures. Often this points to the misuse of a material, one that redesign or reselection can eliminate. So material choice depends on function. But that is not the only constraint.<br>\n <br>\n 2.6 Case Study: Devices to Open Corked Bottles<br>\n <br>\n Function<br>\n <br>\n Shape<br>\n <br>\n Material<br>\n <br>\n Process<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 2.6 The central problem of materials selection in mechanical design: the interaction between function, material, process, and shape.<br>\n <br>\n 2.5 FUNCTION, MATERIAL, SHAPE, AND PROCESS The selection of material is tied in with process and shape. To make a shape, the material is subjected to processes that, collectively, are called manufacture: these include primary forming processes (e.g., casting and forging), material removal processes (machining, drilling), joining processes (e.g., welding) and finishing processes (e.g., painting or electroplating). Function, material, shape, and process interact (Figure 2.6). Function, as already described, influences material choice. Material choice influences processes through the material’s ability to be cast or molded or welded or heat-treated. Process determines shape; size; precision; and, of course, cost. These interactions are two-way: specification of shape restricts the choice of material and process; but equally the specification of process limits the material choice and the accessible shapes. The more sophisticated the design, the tighter the specifications and the greater the interactions. The interaction between function, material, shape, and process lies at the heart of the material selection process. It is a theme we will return to throughout this book, visiting each of the hexagons of Figure 2.6 in turn. But first we look at a case study to illustrate the design process.<br>\n <br>\n 2.6 CASE STUDY: DEVICES TO OPEN CORKED BOTTLES Wine, like cheese, is one of man’s improvements on nature. And as long as humans have cared about wine, people have cared about corks to keep it safely sealed in flasks and bottles. “Corticum... demovebit amphorae...,”<br>\n <br>\n 23<br>\n <br>\n 24<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 2:<br>\n <br>\n The Design Process<br>\n <br>\n (a)<br>\n <br>\n (b)<br>\n <br>\n (c)<br>\n <br>\n ?<br>\n <br>\n (d)<br>\n <br>\n (e)<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 2.7 Left: the market need; a device is sought to allow access to wine contained in a corked bottle. Right: five possible concepts, illustrating physical principles, to fill the need.<br>\n <br>\n (“Uncork the amphora...)” sang Horace2 to celebrate the anniversary of his miraculous escape from death by a falling tree. But how did he do it? A corked bottle creates a market need: the need to gain access to the wine inside. We might state it thus: “A device is required to pull corks from wine bottles.” But hold on. The need must be expressed in solution-neutral form, and this is not. The aim is to gain access to the wine; our statement implies that this will be done by removing the cork, and that the cork will be removed by pulling. There could be other ways. So we will try again: “A device is required to allow access to wine in a corked bottle” (Figure 2.7), and one might add, “with convenience, at modest cost, and without contaminating the wine.” Five concepts for doing this are shown on the right of Figure 2.7. In order, the devices act to remove the cork by axial traction (pulling); to remove it by shear tractions; to push it out from below; to pulverize it; and to bypass it altogether by knocking the neck off the bottle.3 Numerous devices exist that use the first three of these concepts. The others are used too, though generally only in moments of desperation. We shall eliminate these on the grounds that they might contaminate the wine, and examine the others more closely, exploring working principles. Figure 2.8 shows one example for each of the first three concepts: In the first, a screw<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n Horace, Q. 27 BC, Odes, Book III, Ode 8, line 10. A Victorian invention for opening old port, the cork of which may have become brittle with age and alcohol absorption, involved ring-shaped tongs. The tongs were heated red on an open fire, then clamped onto the cold neck of the bottle. The thermal shock removed the neck cleanly and neatly. 3<br>\n <br>\n 2.6 Case Study: Devices to Open Corked Bottles<br>\n <br>\n (a)<br>\n <br>\n (b)<br>\n <br>\n (c)<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 2.8 Working principles for implementing the first three concepts of Figure 2.7.

Right: detailed design of the lever of embodiment with material choice.<br>\n <br>\n is threaded into the cork to which an axial pull is applied; in the second, slender elastic blades inserted down the sides of the cork apply shear tractions when twisted and pulled; and in the third, the cork is pierced by a hollow needle through which a gas is pumped to push the cork out. Examples of all three appear in the cover picture of this chapter. Figure 2.9 shows embodiment sketches for devices based on just one concept—that of axial traction. The first is a direct pull; the other three use some sort of mechanical advantage—levered pull, geared pull, and spring-assisted pull.

They lead directly to the property limits and material indices, as described in Chapter 5, in which we examine procedures with requirements such as “light, strong beam” or “slender, elastic, blade” and use them to identify a subset of materials that perform this function particularly well. The final choice of material and process forms part of the detailed stage of design (Figure 2.9), leading to full specifications to enable manufacture. We conclude by returning to the idea of function structure. That for the cork remover is sketched in the upper part of Figure 2.10: Generate a force, transmit a force, apply the force to the cork. The alternative designs differ in the working principle by which these functions are achieved, as indicated in the lower part of the figure. Others could be devised by making other links.<br>\n <br>\n 2.7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Design is an iterative process. The starting point is a market need captured in a set of design requirements. Concepts for a product that meet the need are devised. If initial estimates and exploration of alternatives suggest that the concept is<br>\n <br>\n 2.8 Further Reading<br>\n <br>\n viable, the design proceeds to the embodiment stage: Working principles are selected, size and layout are decided, and initial estimates of performance and cost are made. If the outcome is successful, the designer proceeds to the detailed design stage: optimization of performance, full analysis of critical components, preparation of detailed production drawings (usually as CAD files), specifications of tolerance, precision, assembly, and finishing methods. Materials selection enters at each stage, but at different levels of breadth and precision. At the conceptual stage all materials and processes are potential candidates, requiring a procedure that allows rapid access to data for a wide range of each, although without the need for great precision. The preliminary selection passes to the embodiment stage, the calculations and optimizations of which require information at a higher level of precision and detail. They eliminate all but a small shortlist of candidate materials and processes for the final, detailed stage of the design. For these few candidates, highest-quality data are required. Data exist that meet the needs of all these levels. Each level requires its own data management scheme, described in the following chapters. The management system must be design-led, yet must recognize the richness of choice and embrace the complex interaction between the material, its shape, the process by which it is given that shape, and the function it is required to perform. And it must allow rapid iteration—back-looping when a particular path proves to be unprofitable. Tools now exist to help with all of this. We will meet one— the CES materials and process selection platform—later in this book. But given this complexity, why not opt for the safe bet: Stick to what you used before? Many have chosen that option. Few are still in business.<br>\n <br>\n 2.8 FURTHER READING A chasm exists between books on design methodology and those on materials selection: each largely ignores the other. The book by French is remarkable for its insights, but the word “material” does not appear in its index. Pahl and Beitz have near-biblical standing in the design camp, but their text is heavy going. Ullman and Cross take a more relaxed approach and are easier to digest. The books by Budinski and Budinski, by Charles, Crane, and Furness, and by Farag present the materials case well, but are less good on design. Lewis illustrates material selection through case studies, but does not develop a systematic procedure.

This chapter presents the menu: the materials shopping list. A successful product—one that performs well, is good value for money, and gives pleasure to the user—uses the best materials for the job, and fully exploits their potential and characteristics. It brings out their flavor, so to speak. The families of materials—metals, polymers, ceramics, and so forth—are introduced in Section 3.2. What do we need to know about them if we are to design with them? That is the subject of Section 3.3, in which distinctions are drawn between various types of materials information. But it is not, in the end, a material that we seek; it is a certain profile of properties—the one that best meets the needs of the design. Properties are the currency of the materials world. They are the bargaining chips—the way you trade off one material against another. The properties important in thermo-mechanical design are defined briefly in Section 3.4. It makes boring reading. The reader who is confident in the definitions and units of moduli, strengths, damping capacities, thermal and electrical conductivities, and the like, may wish to skip this, using it for reference, when needed, for the precise meaning and units of the data in the property charts that come later. Don’t, however, skip Section 3.2. It sets up the classification structure that is used throughout the book. The chapter ends, in the usual way, with a summary.<br>\n <br>\n 3.2 THE FAMILIES OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS It is conventional to classify the materials of engineering into the six broad families shown in Figure 3.1: metals, polymers, elastomers, ceramics, glasses, and hybrids. The members of a family have certain features in<br>\n <br>\n 3.2 The Families of Engineering Materials<br>\n <br>\n Steels Cast irons Al-alloys<br>\n <br>\n Metals Cu-alloys Zn-alloys Ti-alloys PE, PP, PET, PC, PS, PEEK PA (nylons)<br>\n <br>\n Aluminas Silicon carbides<br>\n <br>\n Ceramics<br>\n <br>\n Polymers<br>\n <br>\n Composites Sandwiches<br>\n <br>\n Silicon nitrides Zirconias<br>\n <br>\n Hybrids Segmented structures lattices foams<br>\n <br>\n Polyesters Phenolics Epoxies<br>\n <br>\n Soda glass Borosilicate glass<br>\n <br>\n Isoprene Neoprene Butyl rubber<br>\n <br>\n Glasses<br>\n <br>\n Elastomers<br>\n <br>\n Silica glass Glass-ceramics<br>\n <br>\n Natural rubber Silicones EVA<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 3.1 The menu of engineering materials. The basic families of metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, and elastomers can be combined in various geometries to create hybrids.<br>\n <br>\n common: similar properties, similar processing routes, and, often, similar applications. Metals are stiff. They have relatively high elastic moduli. Most, when pure, are soft and easily deformed. They can be made strong by alloying and by mechanical and heat treatment, but they remain ductile, allowing them to be formed by deformation processes. Certain high-strength alloys (spring steel, for instance) have ductilities as low as 1%, but even this is enough to ensure that the material yields before it fractures and that fracture, when it occurs, is of a tough, ductile type. Partly because of their ductility, metals are prey to fatigue and of all the classes of material, they are the least resistant to corrosion. Ceramics, too, have high moduli, but unlike metal, they are brittle. Their “strength” in tension means the brittle fracture strength; in compression it is the brittle crushing strength, which is about 15 times greater. And because ceramics have no ductility, they have a low tolerance for stress concentrations (like holes or cracks) or for high-contact stresses (at clamping points, for instance). Ductile materials accommodate stress concentrations by deforming in a way that redistributes the load more evenly, and because of this, they can be used under static loads within a small margin of their yield strength. Ceramics cannot. Brittle materials always have a wide scatter in strength, and the strength itself depends on<br>\n <br>\n 33<br>\n <br>\n 34<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 3:<br>\n <br>\n Engineering Materials and Their Properties<br>\n <br>\n the volume of material under load and the time over which it is applied. So ceramics are not as easy to design with as metals. Despite this, they have attractive features. They are stiff, hard, and abrasion-resistant (hence their use for bearings and cutting tools); they retain their strength to high temperatures; and they resist corrosion well. Glasses are noncrystalline (“amorphous”) solids. The most common are the soda-lime and borosilicate glasses familiar as bottles and ovenware, but there are many more. Metals, too, can be made noncrystalline by cooling them sufficiently quickly. The lack of crystal structure suppresses plasticity, so, like ceramics, glasses are hard, brittle, and vulnerable to stress concentrations. Polymers are at the other end of the spectrum. They have moduli that are low, roughly 50 times lower than those of metals, but they can be strong— nearly as strong as metals. A consequence of this is that elastic deflections can be large. They creep, even at room temperature, meaning that a polymer component under load may, with time, acquire a permanent set. And their properties depend on temperature so that a polymer that is tough and flexible at 20°C may be brittle at the 4°C of a household refrigerator, yet may creep rapidly at the 100°C of boiling water. Few have useful strength above 200°C. Some polymers are mainly crystalline, some are amorphous (noncrystalline), some are a mix of crystalline and amorphous—transparency goes with the amorphous structure. If these aspects are allowed for in the design, the advantages of polymers can be exploited. And there are many. When combinations of properties, such as strength per unit weight, are important, polymers can compete with metals. They are easy to shape. Complicated parts performing several functions can be molded from a polymer in a single operation. The large elastic deflections allow the design of polymer components that snap together, making assembly fast and cheap. And by accurately sizing the mold and precoloring the polymer, no finishing operations are needed. Polymers resist corrosion (paints, for instance, are polymers) and have low coefficients of friction. Good design exploits these properties. Elastomers are long-chain polymers above their glass-transition temperature, Tg. The covalent bonds that link the units of the polymer chain remain intact, but the weaker Van der Waals and hydrogen bonds that, below Tg, bind the chains to each other, have melted. This gives elastomers unique properties: Young’s moduli as low as 10−3 GPa (105 times less than that typical of metals) increase with temperature (all other solids show a decrease), and have enormous elastic extension. Their properties differ so much from those of other solids that special tests have evolved to characterize them. This creates a problem: If we wish to select materials by prescribing a desired attribute profile, as we do later in this book, then a prerequisite is a set of attributes common to all materials.<br>\n <br>\n 3.3 Materials Information for Design<br>\n <br>\n To overcome this, we use a common set of properties in the early stages of design, estimating approximate values for anomalies like elastomers. Specialized attributes, representative of one family only, are stored separately; they are for use in the later stages. Hybrids are combinations of two or more materials in a predetermined configuration and scale. They combine the attractive properties of the other families of materials while avoiding some of their drawbacks. Their design is the subject of Chapters 11 and 12. The family of hybrids includes fiber and particulate composites, sandwich structures, lattice structures, foams, cables, and laminates; almost all the materials of nature—wood, bone, skin, and leaf—are hybrids. Fiber-reinforced composites are, of course, the most familiar. Most of those at present available to the engineer have a polymer matrix reinforced by fibers of glass, carbon, or Kevlar (an aramid). They are light, stiff, and strong, and they can be tough. They, and other hybrids using a polymer as one component, cannot be used above 250°C because the polymer softens, but at room temperature their performance can be outstanding. Hybrid components are expensive, and they are relatively difficult to form and join. So, despite their attractive properties, the designer will use them only when the added performance justifies the added cost. Today’s growing emphasis on high performance and fuel efficiency provides increasing drivers for their use. These, then, are the material families. What do we need to know about them?<br>\n <br>\n 3.3 MATERIALS INFORMATION FOR DESIGN The engineer, in selecting materials for a developing design, needs data for the materials’ properties. Engineers are often conservative in their choice, reluctant to consider materials with which they are unfamiliar, and with good reason. Data for the old, well-tried materials are established, reliable, and easily found. Data for newer, emerging, materials may be incomplete or untrustworthy. Yet innovation is often made possible by new materials. So it is important to know how to judge data quality. If you’re going to design something, what sort of materials information do you need? Figure 3.2 draws relevant distinctions. On the left a material is tested and the data are captured. But these raw data—unqualified numbers—are, for our purposes, useless. To make data useful requires statistical analysis. What is the mean value of the property when measured on a large batch of samples? What is the standard deviation? Given these, it is possible to calculate allowables: values of properties that, with a given certainty (say, one part in 106) can be guaranteed. Material texts generally present test data; by contrast, data in most engineering handbooks are allowables.<br>\n <br>\n 35<br>\n <br>\n 36<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 3:<br>\n <br>\n Engineering Materials and Their Properties<br>\n <br>\n Data capture<br>\n <br>\n Statistical analysis<br>\n <br>\n Design guidelines<br>\n <br>\n Economic analysis and business case<br>\n <br>\n Mechanical Properties Bulk modulus Compressive strength Ductility Elastic limit Endurance limit Fracture toughness Hardness Loss coefficient Modulus of rupture Poisson's ratio Shear modulus Tensile strength Young's modulus<br>\n <br>\n Test Raw data (Numbers)<br>\n <br>\n Test data<br>\n <br>\n 4.1 − 4.6 55 − 60 0.06 − 0.07 40 − 45 24 − 27 2.3 − 2.6 100 − 140 0.009 − 0.026 50 − 55 0.38 − 0.42 0.85 − 0.95 45 − 48 2.5 − 2.8<br>\n <br>\n Allowables Information (Numbers you understand)<br>\n <br>\n GPa MPa MPa MPa MPa.m1/2 MPa MPa GPa MPa GPa<br>\n <br>\n Profitable Potential applications applications Knowledge (Numbers you know how to use)<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 3.2 Types of material information. We are interested here in the types found in the center of this schematic: structured data for design “allowables” and the characteristics of a material that relate to its ability to be formed, joined, and finished; records of experience with its use; and design guidelines for its use.<br>\n <br>\n One can think of data with known precision and provenance as information. Information can generally be reported as tables of numbers, as yes/no statements or as rankings: that is, it can be structured. Many attributes that can be structured are common to all materials; all have a density, an elastic modulus, a strength, a thermal conductivity. Structured information can be stored in a database and—since all materials have values—it is the starting point for selecting between them. The cover picture of this chapter shows part of a record for the polymer ABS with structured data on the left, reported as ranges that derive from differences in the way different producers make it. This is a step forward, but it is not enough. To design with a material, you need to know its real character, its strengths, and its weaknesses. How do you shape it? How do you join it? Who has used it before and for what? Did it fail? Why? This information exists in handbooks, is documented as design guidelines, and is reported in failure analyses and case studies. It consists largely of text, graphs and images, and while certain bits of it may be available for one material, for another they may not. It is messier, but it is essential in reaching a final selection. We refer to this supporting information as documentation. The image and text on the right of the ABS cover are examples of documentation. There is more. Material uses are subject to standards and codes. These rarely refer to a single material but to classes or subclasses. For a material to be used in contact with food or drugs, it must carry FDA approval or the equivalent. Metals and composites for use in U.S. military aircraft must have military<br>\n <br>\n 3.3 Materials Information for Design<br>\n <br>\n specification approval. To qualify for best-practice design for the environment, material usage must confirm to ISO 14040 guidelines. And so forth. This, too, is a form of documentation (Table 3.1). The ensemble of information about a material, structured and unstructured, constitutes knowledge. There is yet more (Figure 3.2, right). To succeed in the marketplace, a product must be economically viable and compete successfully, in terms of performance, consumer appeal, and cost, with the competition.

Much can be said about this, but not here; for now the focus is on structured data and documentation. That’s the essential background. Now for the properties themselves.<br>\n <br>\n 3.4 MATERIAL PROPERTIES AND THEIR UNITS Each material can be thought of as having a set of attributes or properties. The combination that characterizes a given material is its property profile. Property profiles are assembled by systematic testing. In this section we scan the nature of the tests and the definition and units of the properties (see Table 3.1). Property values are listed in Appendix A. Units are given here in the SI system. Conversion factors to other systems are printed on the inside front and back cover of the book.<br>\n <br>\n General properties The density, ρ (units: kg/m 3), is the mass per unit volume. We measure it today as Archimedes did: by weighing in air and in a fluid of known density. The price, Cm (units: $/kg), spans a wide range. Some cost as little as $0.2/kg, others as much as $1,000/kg. Prices, of course, fluctuate, and they depend on the quantity you want and on your status as a “preferred customer” with your chosen vendor. Despite this uncertainty, it is useful to have an approximate price in the early stages of material selection.<br>\n <br>\n Mechanical properties Ductile metals<br>\n <br>\n Tensile strength, σ ts<br>\n <br>\n Stress of order 500 MPa<br>\n <br>\n Stress σ = F/Ao<br>\n <br>\n 38<br>\n <br>\n Ao Of order 200 MPa Yield strength, σy<br>\n <br>\n L<br>\n <br>\n F<br>\n <br>\n * Strain of order 40%<br>\n <br>\n Slope E = σ /ε 0.2% offset<br>\n <br>\n Strain ε = δ L/L<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 3.3 The stress-strain curve for a metal, showing the modulus, E, the 0.2% yield strength, σy, and the ultimate strength, σts.<br>\n <br>\n The elastic modulus, E (units: GPa or GN/m2), is the slope of the initial, linear-elastic, part of the stress-strain curve (Figure 3.3). Young’s modulus, E, describes response to tensile or compressive loading; the shear modulus, G, describes response to shear loading; and the bulk modulus, K, describes the response to hydrostatic pressure.

Accurate moduli are measured dynamically: by exciting the natural vibrations of a beam or a wire or by measuring the velocity of sound waves in the material. In an isotropic material, the moduli are related in the following ways: E =<br>\n <br>\n 3G E G1⁄4 1 + G/3K 2ð1 + νÞ<br>\n <br>\n K1⁄4<br>\n <br>\n E 3ð1 − 2νÞ<br>\n <br>\n (3.1)<br>\n <br>\n Commonly, ν ≈ 1/3 when G≈<br>\n <br>\n 3 E 8<br>\n <br>\n and K ≈E<br>\n <br>\n (3.2a)<br>\n <br>\n Elastomers are exceptional.

In this book we examine data for E; approximate values for the others can be derived from the (3.2) equations when needed.<br>\n <br>\n Estimating moduli Young’s modulus E for copper is 124 GPa; its Poisson’s ratio ν is 0.345. What is its shear modulus, G?<br>\n <br>\n Answer Inserting the values for E and ν in the central equation (3.1) gives G = 46.1 GPa. The measured value is 45.6 GPa, a difference of only 1%.<br>\n <br>\n 39<br>\n <br>\n Engineering Materials and Their Properties<br>\n <br>\n The strength, σf (units: MPa or MN/m2), of a solid requires careful definition. For metals, we identify σ f with the 0.2% offset yield strength σ y (see Figure 3.3), that is, the stress at which the stress-strain curve for axial loading deviates by a strain of 0.2% from the linear-elastic line. It is the same in tension and compression. For polymers, σ f is identified as the stress at which the stress-strain curve becomes markedly nonlinear, at a strain typically of 1% (Figure 3.4). This may be caused by shear yielding: the irreversible slipping of molecular chains; or it may be caused by crazing: the formation of low-density, crack-like volumes that scatter light, making the polymer look white. Polymers are a little stronger (≈ 20%) in compression than in tension. Strength, for ceramics and glasses, depends strongly on the mode of loading (Figure 3.5). In tension, “strength” means the fracture strength, σt. In compression it means the crushing strength σ c , which is much greater; typically σ c = 10 to 15 σ t<br>\n <br>\n (3.3)<br>\n <br>\n When a material is difficult to grip, as is a ceramic, its strength can be measured in bending. The flexural strength or modulus of rupture, σflex (units: MPa) is the maximum surface stress in a bent beam at the instant of failure (Figure 3.6). One might expect this to be the same as the strength measured in tension, but for ceramics it is greater by a factor of about 1.3 because the volume subjected to this maximum stress is small and the probability of a large flaw lying in it is small also; in simple tension all flaws see the same stress.<br>\n <br>\n Brittle ceramics Ductile polymers<br>\n <br>\n *<br>\n <br>\n σf (compression) of order 3000 MPa<br>\n <br>\n Brittle: T &gt; Tg 1% strain<br>\n <br>\n Strain ε = δ L/L<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 3.4 Stress-strain curves for a polymer below, at, and above its glass transition temperature, Tg.<br>\n <br>\n Stress σ = F/Ao<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 3:<br>\n <br>\n Stress σ = F/Ao<br>\n <br>\n 40<br>\n <br>\n Compression<br>\n <br>\n Slope E =σ /ε<br>\n <br>\n *<br>\n <br>\n Ao F<br>\n <br>\n L<br>\n <br>\n σt (tension) of order 300 MPa Tension<br>\n <br>\n Strain ε = δ L/ L<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 3.5 Stress-strain curves for a ceramic in tension and in compression. The compressive strength, σc, is 10 to 15 times greater than the tensile strength, σt.<br>\n <br>\n 3.4 Material Properties and Their Units<br>\n <br>\n The strength of a composite is best defined by a set deviation from linear-elastic behavior; often an offset of 0.5% is taken. Composites that contain fibers, including natural composites such as wood, are a little weaker (up to 30%) in compression than tension because fibers buckle. In subsequent chapters, σ f for composites means the tensile strength.<br>\n <br>\n MOR<br>\n <br>\n *<br>\n <br>\n Ff<br>\n <br>\n Force F<br>\n <br>\n Force F b t<br>\n <br>\n L<br>\n <br>\n 3Ff L σ flex = = MOR 2b t 2 Deflection δ<br>\n <br>\n Strength, then, depends on material class and on mode of loading. Other modes of loading are possible: shear, for instance. Yield under multiaxial loads is related to that in simple tension by a yield function. For metals, the Von Mises yield function is a good description: FIGURE 3.6 The modulus of rupture (MOR) is the surface stress at failure in bending. It is equal to, or slightly larger than, the failure stress in tension.<br>\n <br>\n ðσ 1 − σ 2 Þ2 + ðσ 2 − σ 3 Þ2 + ðσ 3 − σ 1 Þ2 = 2 σ f 2<br>\n <br>\n (3.4)<br>\n <br>\n where σ 1 , σ 2 , and σ3 are the principal stresses, positive when tensile; σ1 , by convention, is the greatest or most positive; σ 3 , the smallest or least positive. For polymers the yield function is modified to include the effect of pressure:  2 2 2 2 2 1+βp ðσ 1 − σ 2 Þ + ðσ 2 − σ 3 Þ + ðσ 3 − σ 1 Þ = 2 σ f (3.5) K where K is the bulk modulus of the polymer, β ≈ 2 is a numerical coefficient that characterizes the pressure dependence of the flow strength, and the pressure p is defined by p = − 1 ðσ 1 + σ 2 + σ 3 Þ 3 For ceramics, a Coulomb flow law is used: σ 1 − Bσ 2 = C<br>\n <br>\n (3.6)<br>\n <br>\n where B and C are constants. The tensile (or ultimate) strength σ ts (units: MPa) is the nominal stress at which a round bar of the material, loaded in tension, separates (Figure 3.3). For brittle solids—ceramics, glasses, and brittle polymers—it is the same as the failure strength in tension. For metals, ductile polymers, and most composites, it is greater than the yield strength, σy, by a factor of between<br>\n <br>\n 41<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 3:<br>\n <br>\n Engineering Materials and Their Properties<br>\n <br>\n Using yield functions A metal pipe of radius r and wall thickness t carry an internal pressure p. The pressure generates a circumferential wall stress of σ1 = pr/t, an axial wall stress σ2 = pr/2t. At what pressure will the pipe first yield?<br>\n <br>\n Answer Setting σ 2 = σ 1 /2, σ 3 = 0 and σ f = σ y in Equation (3.4) gives the yield condition pffiffiffi 2 t σ 1 = ð2/ 3Þσ y . Thus the pressure p* that just causes first yield is p  = pffiffi r σ y . 3<br>\n <br>\n 1.1 and 3 because of work hardening or, in the case of composites, load transfer to the reinforcement. Cyclic loading can cause a crack to nucleate and grow in a material, culminating in fatigue failure. For many materials there exists a fatigue or endurance limit, σ e (units: MPa), illustrated by the Δσ − N f curve of Figure 3.7. It is the stress amplitude Δσ below which fracture does not occur, or occurs only after a very large number (Nf &gt; 107) of cycles. Tensile and compression tests are not always convenient: A large sample is needed and the test destroys it. The hardness test gives an approximate, nondestructive, measure of the strength. The hardness, H (SI units: MPa) of a material is measured by pressing a pointed diamond or hardened steel ball into the material’s surface (Figure 3.8). The hardness is defined as the indenter force divided by the projected area of the indent.

The translation Detailed modeling gets a little complicated, so let us start with some intelligent guesses (IGs). First, if the windings must carry load (the first constraint) they must be strong—the higher the strength, the greater the field they can tolerate. So (IG 1) we want materials with a high elastic limit σy. Second, a current i flowing for a time tp through a coil of resistance Re dissipates i2 Re tp joules of energy, and if this takes place in a volume V, the temperature rise is ΔT =<br>\n <br>\n i2 Re tp VCp ρ<br>\n <br>\n where Cp is the specific heat of the material and ρ is its density. So (IG 2) to maximize the current (and thus the field B) we need materials with low values of Re /Cp ρ or, since resistance Re is proportional to resistivity ρe for a fixed coil geometry, materials with low ρe /Cp ρ. Both guesses are correct. This has gotten us a long way; a simple search for material with high σ y —or rather low M1 = 1/σ y (since we must express objectives in a form to be minimized)—and low M2 = ρe /Cp ρ will find a sensible subset. The two are plotted in Figure 8.7 for some 1200 metals and alloys (ignore for the moment the black selection boxes). The materials with the best combination of indices lie along the lower envelope of the populated region.

The axes are the two “guesses” made in the text—the modeling confirms the choice and allows precise positioning of the selection lines for a given pulse duration.<br>\n <br>\n with low M1; those near A are the best choice. Heating is the dominant constraint when pulses are long, and materials near B, with low M2, are the answer. This is progress, and it may be enough. If we want greater resolution, we must abandon guesswork (intelligent though it was) and apply min–max methods, requiring more detailed modeling. It gets a bit involved—if it looks too grim, skip to the next section, “The selection.” Consider first destruction by magnetic loading.

Now consider destruction by overheating. High-powered magnets are initially cooled in liquid nitrogen to –196°C in order to reduce the resistance of the windings; if the windings warm above room temperature, the resisðtance, R e , in general becomes too large. The entire energy of the pulse, i2 Re dt ≈ i2 Re tp is converted into heat (here Re is the average of the resistance over the heating cycle and tp is the length of the pulse); and since there is insufficient time for the heat to be conducted away, this energy causes the temperature of the coil to rise by ΔT, where ΔT =<br>\n <br>\n i2 Re tp ρe t p B2 = 2. 2 Cp ρV μo d C p ρ<br>\n <br>\n (8.19)<br>\n <br>\n Here ρe is the resistivity of the material of the windings, V its volume, Cp its specific heat (J/kg.K), and ρ its density.

But we have the same problem that appeared in the last case study—someone preselected the three materials in the table; surely there must be others? And the choice we reached is specific to a magnet with the dimensions listed above and a pulse time t p of 10 ms. What happens if we change these? We need the graphical method.

The axes, as already said, are the two indices M1 and M2. Three selections are shown, one for ultrashort-pulse magnets, the other two for longer pulses. Each selection box is a contour of constant field B; its corner lies on the coupling line for the appropriate pulse duration. The best choice, for a given pulse length, is that contained in the box that lies farthest down its coupling line. The results are summarized in Table 8.9. Postscript The case study, as developed here, is an oversimplification. Magnet design today is very sophisticated, involving nested sets of electroand super-conducting magnets (up to nine deep), with geometry the most important variable.

We start with a simple example, revisiting the selection of materials for slender table legs. The translation The design requirements set down by Snr. Tavolino for his table (refer to Table 6.5) involved two objectives: that the leg be as light and as thin as possible. The mass m of a leg (Equation (6.8)) is proportional to M1 =<br>\n <br>\n ρ E1/2<br>\n <br>\n The thickness 2r (Equation (6.9)) scales with M2 =<br>\n <br>\n 1 E<br>\n <br>\n Snr. Tavolino wishes to minimize both. The selection The proper way to tackle multiobjective problems like this one is to make a trade-off plot. Figure 8.9 is an example: M1 on the vertical axis, M2 on the horizontal one. For clarity, only ferrous alloys, light alloys, composites, and woods appear on the plot—that set includes almost all materials that could be thought of as candidates. The classes cluster very tightly because both modulus and density have narrow ranges. Legs made of spruce or fir are potentially lighter than those made of any other material. Composites offer legs that are almost as light and much thinner. But, interestingly, they do not offer the thinnest of all—steel does<br>\n <br>\n Heavy<br>\n <br>\n 8.6 Conflicting Objectives: Wafer-thin Casings for Must-have Electronics<br>\n <br>\n 2000<br>\n <br>\n Thin but heavy<br>\n <br>\n M1 = ρ/E1/2 (kg/m3/GPa1/2 )<br>\n <br>\n 1000 AISI 1030 C-steel<br>\n <br>\n 500<br>\n <br>\n 200<br>\n <br>\n Heavy and thick<br>\n <br>\n Ti Steels alloys Mg Al alloys alloys<br>\n <br>\n Composites<br>\n <br>\n AISI 5140 LA steel White cast iron Ti-4Al-4Mo-2Sn Ti-8Al-1Mo-1V Al 8090 T8<br>\n <br>\n Woods<br>\n <br>\n Al 2090 T8 Carbon-polyester Carbon-SMC<br>\n <br>\n 100<br>\n <br>\n Epoxy-aramid<br>\n <br>\n Oak<br>\n <br>\n Spruce Fir<br>\n <br>\n Trade-off surface<br>\n <br>\n Willow<br>\n <br>\n Light<br>\n <br>\n 50 Thin and light<br>\n <br>\n Light but thick MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n 20<br>\n <br>\n 10 −3 Thin<br>\n <br>\n 10 −2<br>\n <br>\n 10 −1<br>\n <br>\n M2 = 1/E (GPa −1)<br>\n <br>\n 1 Thick<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 8.9 The trade-off plot for the table leg.

Overall, composites offer the best compromise—very low weight and attractive slenderness. Postscript But (as we asked in Section 6.4), wouldn’t a tubular leg be lighter? Fatter, but how much fatter? Wouldn’t the tubular solution be the best compromise? The answer will have to wait a little longer—until Section 10.5.

The ideal is a device that you can slip into a shirt pocket and not even know that it is there. The casing has to be stiff and strong enough to protect the electronics—the display, particularly—from damage. Casings used to be made of molded ABS or polycarbonate. To be stiff enough an ABS case has to be at least 2 mm thick,<br>\n <br>\n 233<br>\n <br>\n 234<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 8:<br>\n <br>\n Case Studies: Multiple Constraints and Conflicting Objectives<br>\n <br>\n too much for today’s designs in which thinness and lightness are very highly valued. But the consequences of making the casing too thin are severe: Mobile phones get sat on, and portable computers end up under piles of books. If the casing is insufficiently stiff, it flexes and damages the screen. The challenge: to identify materials for casings that are at least as stiff as a 2-mm ABS case but thinner and lighter. We must recognize that the thinnest may not be the lightest, and vice versa. A trade-off will be needed. Table 8.10 summarizes the requirements. The translation We idealize the loading on a panel of the casing in the way shown in the Figure 8.10. External loads cause it to bend.

The selection Figure 8.11 shows the necessary plot, here limited to a few material classes for simplicity. It is divided into four sectors with ABS at the center at the coordinates (1,1). The solutions in sector A are both thinner and lighter than ABS, some by a factor of 2. Those in sector B and C are better by one metric but worse by the other. Those in sector D are worse by both. To narrow in on an optimal choice we sketch in a trade-off surface, shown as the broken line. The solutions nearest to this surface are, in terms of one metric or the other, good choices. Intuition guides us to those in or near Sector A. This is already enough to suggest choices that offer savings in thickness and in weight.

CFRP, GFRP, titanium, aluminum, and magnesium all offer casings that have lower (better) values of Z*. The problem with this plot is that it is specific to a single value of the ratio αt /αm . If the relative importance of thinness and lightness are changed, the ranking changes too. We need a more general method. It is provided by constructing penalty contours on the trade-off plot. Two are shown as blue lines in Figure 8.11. The linear relationship of Equation (8.29) plots as a family of curves (not straight lines because of the log scales), with Z /αm decreasing toward the bottom left. The absolute value of Z  /αm does not matter—all we need it for is to identify the point at which a contour is tangent to the trade-off surface as shown in Figure 8.11.

Now titanium and even steel become attractive candidates. Postscript Back in 1997, when extreme thinness and lightness first became major design drivers, the conclusions reached here were new. At that time almost all casings for handheld electronics were made of ABS, polycarbonate, or, occasionally, steel. Now, 12 or more years later, examples of aluminum, magnesium, titanium, and even CFRP casings can be found in currently marketed products. The value of the case study (which dates from 1997) is as an illustration of the way in which systematic methods can be applied to multiobjective selection.

Here is another example—materials for the brake calipers of a Formula 1 racing car. The translation The brake caliper can be idealized as two beams of length L, depth b, and thickness h, locked together at their ends (see this chapter’s cover picture and Figure 8.13). Each beam is loaded in bending when the brake is applied, and because braking generates heat, it gets hot. The lower schematic represents one of the beams. Its length L and depth b are given. The beam stiffness S is critical: If it is inadequate the caliper will flex, impairing braking efficiency and allowing vibration. Its ability to transmit heat, too, is critical since part of the heat generated in braking must be conducted out through the caliper. Table 8.11 summarizes the requirements. The mass of the caliper scales with that of one of the beams.

We use this as a standard for comparison, normalizing Equations (8.34) and (8.35) by the values for cast iron (density ρ o , modulus E o , and conductivity λ o ), giving   1/3  ρ ma Eo = 1/2 ma,o ρo E<br>\n <br>\n (8.36)<br>\n <br>\n and 1/3 qa,o λ Eo = o 1/3 qa λE<br>\n <br>\n (8.37)<br>\n <br>\n The equation for qa has been inverted so that the best choice of material is that which minimizes both of these. Figure 8.14 shows a chart with these as axes. It is divided into four quadrants, centered on cast iron at the point (1,1). Each bubble describes a material. Those in the lower left are better than cast iron by both objectives; an aluminum caliper, for example, has half the weight and offers twice the heat transfer. The ultimate choice is beryllium or its alloy Be 40%Al.

The penalty function is plotted in Figure 8.14 for three values of the ratio αq /αm of the exchange constants. Each is tangent to a trade-off surface that excludes the “exotic” beryllium alloys, which otherwise dominate the selection for all values. For αq /αm = 0:1, meaning mass reduction is of prime importance, magnesium alloys are the best choice. If mass reduction and heat transfer are given equal weight (αq /αm = 1), aluminum alloys become a good choice. If heat transfer is the overriding consideration (αq /αm = 10), alloys based on copper win.

But although they conflict, an optimum selection is still possible. The “active constraint” method, developed in Chapter 7, allows the selection of materials that optimally meet two or more constraints. It is illustrated here by three case studies, two of them mechanical, one electro-mechanical. Greater challenges arise when the design must meet two or more conflicting objectives (such as minimizing mass, volume, cost, and environmental impact).

The most obvious common currency is cost itself, requiring an “exchange rate” to be established between cost and the other objectives. This can be done for mass and—at least in principle—for other objectives too.

A material has a modulus and a strength, but it can be made stiffer and stronger when loaded in bending or twisting by shaping it into an I-beam or a hollow tube. It can be made less stiff by flattening it into a flat leaf or winding it, in the form of wire, into a helix. Thinned shapes help dissipate heat; cellular shapes help conserve it. There are shapes to maximize electrical capacitance and to conserve magnetic field; shapes that control optical reflection, diffraction, and refraction; shapes to reflect a sound, and shapes to absorb it. Shape is even used to change the way a material feels, making it smooth or rough, slippery or grippy. And of course, it is shape that distinguishes the Venus de Milo from the marble block from which she was carved. It is a rich subject. Here we explore one part of it—the way shape can be used to increase the mechanical efficiency of a material. Shaped sections carry bending, torsional, and axial-compressive loads more efficiently than do solid sections. By “shaped” we mean that the cross-section is formed as a tube, a box section, an I-section, or the like. By “efficient” we mean that, for given loading conditions, the section uses as little material as possible. Tubes, boxes, and I-sections will be referred to as “simple shapes.” Even greater efficiencies are possible with sandwich panels (thin load-bearing skins bonded to a foam or honeycomb interior) and with more elaborate structures (the Warren truss, for instance). This chapter extends selection methods so as to include shape (Figure 9.1). Often this is not needed: In the Case Studies of Chapter 6, shape either did not enter at all, or, when it did, it was not a variable (that is, we compared different materials with the same shape). But when two different materials are available,<br>\n <br>\n 9.1 Introduction and Synopsis<br>\n <br>\n Function Translation, giving Constraints Objectives for selection Shape<br>\n <br>\n Material<br>\n <br>\n Shape factors Indices that include shape Coselection of material + shape<br>\n <br>\n Material families classes, members Material attributes and documenttion<br>\n <br>\n Process<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 9.1 Section shape is important for certain modes of loading. When shape is a variable, a new term—the shape factor φ—appears in some of the material indices.<br>\n <br>\n each with its own section shape, the more general problem arises: how to choose the best combination from among the vast range of materials and the section shapes that are available or could potentially be made. Take the example of a bicycle: Its forks are loaded in bending. They could, say, be made of steel or of wood—early bikes were made of wood. But steel is available as a thin-walled tube whereas wood is not; wood components, usually, are solid. A solid wood bicycle is certainly lighter for the same stiffness than a solid steel one, but is it lighter than one made of steel tubing? Might a magnesium I-section be lighter still? How, in short, is one to choose the best combination of material and shape? A procedure for answering these and related questions is developed in this chapter. It involves the definition of shape factors. A material can be thought of as having properties but no shape. A structure is a material made into a shape (Figure 9.2). Shape factors are measures of the efficiency of material usage. Further, they enable the definition of material indices, such as those of Chapter 5, but now include shape. When shape is constant, the indices reduce + = exactly to those of Chapter 5; when shape is a variable, however, the shape factor appears in the expresMaterial Shape Shaped material sions for the indices. They let you compare shaped materials and guide the choice of the best combina- FIGURE 9.2 tion of material and shape.

Thus ties<br>\n <br>\n 9.2 Shape Factors<br>\n <br>\n carry tensile loads; beams carry bending moments; shafts carry torques; columns carry compressive axial loads. Figure 9.3 shows these modes of loading applied to shapes that resist them well. The point it makes is that the best material-shape combination depends on the mode of loading. In what follows, we separate the modes, dealing with each separately. In axial tension, the area of the cross-section is important but its shape is not: All sections with the same area will carry the same load.

Torsion, too, has its efficient shapes: Circular tubes, for instance, are more efficient than either solid sections or I-sections. To characterize this we need a metric—a way of measuring the structural efficiency of a section shape, independent of the material of which it is made. An obvious metric is that given by the ratio φ (phi) of the stiffness or strength of the shaped section to that of a “neutral” reference shape, which we take to be that of a solid square section with the same cross-sectional area A, and thus the same mass per unit length m l , as the shaped section (Figure 9.4).

The three members of each horizontal group differ in scale but have the same shape factor— each member is a magnified or shrunken version of its neighbors. Shape-efficiency factors φeB for common shapes in bending, calculated from the expressions for A and I in Table 9.2, are listed in the first column of Table 9.3. Solid equi-axed sections (circles, squares, hexagons, octagons) all have values very close to 1—for practical purposes they can be set equal to 1. But if the section is elongated, hollow, or of I-section, things change; a thin-walled tube or a slender I-beam can have a value of 50 or more. A beam with φeB = 50 is 50 times stiffer than a solid beam of the same weight. Figure 9.6 is a plot of I against A for values of φeB (Equation (9.3)). The contour for φeB = 1 describes the square-section reference beam. Those for φeB = 10 and φeB = 100 describe more efficient shapes, as suggested by the icons at the bottom left, in each of which the axis of bending is horizontal. But it is not always high stiffness that is wanted. Springs, cradles, suspensions, cables, and other structures that must flex yet have high tensile strength rely on having a low bending stiffness. Then we want low shape efficiency. It is achieved by spreading the material in a plane containing the axis of bending to form sheets or wires, as suggested by the contours for φeB = 0:1 and 0.01. 1 This elastic shape-efficiency factor is related to the radius of gyration, Rg, by φeB = 12R2g /A. It is related to the “shape parameter,” k1, of Shanley (1960) by φeB = 12k1 .<br>\n <br>\n 9.2 Shape Factors<br>\n <br>\n Calculating shape factors A tube has a radius r = 10 mm and a wall thickness t = 1 mm. How much stiffer is it in bending than a solid cylinder of the same mass per unit length ml ?<br>\n <br>\n Answer The difference is the ratio of the two shape factors. The shape factor for the tube, from<br>\n <br>\n  Table 9.3, is φeB = π3 rt = 9:55: That for a solid circular section is φeB = π3 = 0:955: The tube is stiffer by a factor of 10.<br>\n <br>\n Elastic twisting of shafts (Figure 9.3(c)) Shapes that resist bending well may not be so good when twisted. The stiffness of a shaft—the torque T divided by the angle of twist θ—is proportional to GK, where G is its shear modulus and K is its torsional moment of area. For circular sections, K is identical with the polar moment of area J: J=∫<br>\n <br>\n r 2 dA<br>\n <br>\n φBe = 2<br>\n <br>\n (a)<br>\n <br>\n φBe = 10<br>\n <br>\n (9.4) (b)<br>\n <br>\n section<br>\n <br>\n where dA is the differential element of area at the radial distance r, measured from the center of the section. For noncircular sections, K is less than J; it is defined such that the angle of twist θ is related to the torque T by ST =<br>\n <br>\n T = KG θ L<br>\n <br>\n (9.5)<br>\n <br>\n where L is the length of the shaft and G is the shear modulus of the material of which it is made. Approximate expressions for K are listed in Table 9.2.<br>\n <br>\n φBe = 15<br>\n <br>\n (c)<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 9.5 (a) A set of rectangular sections with φeB = 2.

Efficient structures have high values of the ratio I ⁄A2 ; inefficient structures (ones that bend easily) have low values. Real structural sections have values of I and A that lie in the shaded zones. Note that there are limits on A and on the maximum shape efficiency φeB that depend on material.<br>\n <br>\n 253<br>\n <br>\n 254<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 9:<br>\n <br>\n Selection of Material and Shape<br>\n <br>\n The torsional constant K o for a solid square section (Table 9.2, top row with b = h) is ko = 0:14 A2 giving φeT = 7:14<br>\n <br>\n K A2<br>\n <br>\n (9.7)<br>\n <br>\n It, too, has the value 1 for a solid square section, and has values near 1 for any solid, equi-axed section; but for thin-walled shapes, particularly tubes, it can be large. As before, sections with the same value of φeT differ in size but not shape. Values derived from the expressions for K and A in Table 9.2 are listed in Table 9.3. Failure in bending Plasticity starts when the stress, somewhere, first reaches the yield strength σy; fracture occurs when this stress first exceeds the fracture strength σ fr ; fatigue failure, if it exceeds the endurance limit σ e . Any one of these constitutes failure. As in earlier chapters, we use the symbol σf for the failure stress, meaning “the local stress that will first cause yielding or fracture or fatigue failure.” In bending, the stress σ is largest at the point ym on the surface of the beam that lies furthest from the neutral axis. Its value is σ=<br>\n <br>\n M ym M = I Z<br>\n <br>\n (9.8)<br>\n <br>\n where M is the bending moment. Failure occurs when this stress first exceeds σ f . Thus, in problems of beam failure, shape enters through the f section modulus, Z = I/ym. The strength efficiency of the shaped beam φB is measured by the ratio Z/Zo, where Zo is the section modulus of a reference beam of square section with the same cross-sectional area, A: Zo =<br>\n <br>\n b3o A3/2 = 6 6<br>\n <br>\n (9.9)<br>\n <br>\n Z 6Z = 3/2 Zo A<br>\n <br>\n (9.10)<br>\n <br>\n Thus, f<br>\n <br>\n φB =<br>\n <br>\n Like the other shape-efficiency factor, it is dimensionless and therefore f independent of scale. As before, φB = 1 describes the square-section f reference beam. Table 9.3 gives expressions for φB for other shapes derived from the values of the section modulus, Z, in Table 9.2. A beam with a failure shape-efficiency factor of 10 is 10 times stronger in bending than a solid square section of the same weight. Figure 9.7 is a plot of Z against A for f values of φB (Equation (9.10)). The other contours describe shapes that are more or less efficient, as suggested by the icons.<br>\n <br>\n 9.2 Shape Factors<br>\n <br>\n 10−1<br>\n <br>\n φ Bf = 100<br>\n <br>\n Plastic bending<br>\n <br>\n 10<br>\n <br>\n 1<br>\n <br>\n Section modulus Z (m3 )<br>\n <br>\n 10−2<br>\n <br>\n 0.1<br>\n <br>\n Structural steel sections 10−3<br>\n <br>\n 0.01 10−4<br>\n <br>\n Structural timber sections<br>\n <br>\n 10−5<br>\n <br>\n 10−6<br>\n <br>\n 10−7 10−4<br>\n <br>\n Extruded aluminum sections<br>\n <br>\n 10−3<br>\n <br>\n 10−2 Section area A (m2 )<br>\n <br>\n 10−1<br>\n <br>\n 1<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 9.7 The section modulus Z plotted against section area A. Efficient structures have high values of the ratio Z ⁄A3 ⁄ 2 ; inefficient structures (ones that bend easily) have low values. Real structural sections have values of Z and A that lie in the shaded zones. Note that there are limits on A and on the maximum shape efficiency φfB that depend on material.<br>\n <br>\n Evaluating shape factors A beam has a square-box section with a height h = 100 mm, a width b = 100 mm, and a wall thickness t = 5 mm. What is the value of its shape factor φfB ?   Answer qffiffi 1 + 3b h f 1ffiffi h p The shape factor for the box section, from Table 9.3, is φB = 2 t  3/2 = 4:47. The b 1+ h<br>\n <br>\n box section is stronger than a solid square-section beam of the same mass per unit length by a factor of 4.5.<br>\n <br>\n Failure in torsion In torsion the problem is more complicated. For circular rods or tubes subjected to a torque T (as in Figure 9.3(c)) the shear stress τ is a maximum at the outer surface, at the radial distance rm from the axis of bending: τ=<br>\n <br>\n Trm J<br>\n <br>\n (9.11)<br>\n <br>\n 255<br>\n <br>\n 256<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 9:<br>\n <br>\n Selection of Material and Shape<br>\n <br>\n The quantity J/rm , in twisting has the same character as I/ym in bending. For noncircular sections with ends that are free to warp, the maximum surface stress is given instead by τ= T Q<br>\n <br>\n (9.12)<br>\n <br>\n where Q, with units of m 3, now plays the role in torsion that Z plays in f bending. This allows the definition of a shape factor, φT , for failure in torsion, following the same pattern as before: f<br>\n <br>\n φT =<br>\n <br>\n Q Q = 4:8 3/2 Qo A<br>\n <br>\n (9.13)<br>\n <br>\n f<br>\n <br>\n Values of Q and φT are listed in Tables 9.2 and 9.3. Shafts with solid f equiaxed sections all have values of φT close to 1. Fully plastic bending or twisting (such that the yield strength is exceeded throughout the section) involves a further pair of shape factors. Generally speaking, shapes that resist the onset of plasticity well are resistant to full pl f plasticity also, so φB does not differ much from φB . New shape factors for these are not, at this stage, necessary. Axial loading: Column buckling A column of length L, loaded in compression, buckles elastically when the load exceeds the Euler load Fc =<br>\n <br>\n n2 π 2 E Imin L<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n (9.14)<br>\n <br>\n Inreasing strength by shaping A slender, solid cylindrical column of height L supports a load F. If overloaded, the column fails by elastic buckling. By how much is the load-bearing capacity increased if the solid cylinder is replaced by a hollow circular tube of the same cross-section A?<br>\n <br>\n Answer Replacing Imin in Equation 9.14 by φeB A2 /12 from Equation 9.3 gives Fc =<br>\n <br>\n n 2 π 2 A2 E φeB 12 L2<br>\n <br>\n The failure load is increased by the ratio of the shape factor for the tube to the shape factor of the solid cylinder. The shape factor for a thin-walled tube is φeB = 3 r /π t; for the solid cylinder it is φeB = 3/π (Table 9.3). The ratio is r/t, where r is the radius and t is the wall thickness of the tube.<br>\n <br>\n 9.3 Limits to Shape Efficiency<br>\n <br>\n where n is a constant that depends on the end-constraints. The resistance to buckling, then, depends on the smallest second moment of area, Imin, and the appropriate shape factor (φeB ) is the same as that for elastic bending (Equation (9.3)) with I replaced by Imin.<br>\n <br>\n 9.3 LIMITS TO SHAPE EFFICIENCY The conclusions so far: If you wish to make stiff, strong structures that are efficient (using as little material as possible), make the shape-efficiency factors as large as possible. It would seem, then, that the bigger the value of φ the better. True, but there are limits. We examine these next. Empirical limits There are practical limits for the slenderness of sections, and these determine, for a given material, the maximum attainable efficiencies. These limits may be imposed by manufacturing constraints: The difficulty or expense of making an efficient shape may simply be too great. More often they are imposed by the properties of the material itself because these determine the failure mode of the section. We explore these limits in two ways. The first is empirical: by examining the shapes in which real materials—steel, aluminum, and so on—are actually made, recording the limiting efficiency of available sections. The second is by the analysis of the mechanical stability of shaped sections. Standard sections for beams, shafts, and columns are generally prismatic. Prismatic shapes are easily made by rolling, extrusion, drawing, pultrusion, or sawing (see the chapter opening picture). The section may be solid, closed-hollow (like a tube or box), or open-hollow (an I-, U-, or L-section, for instance). Each class of shape can be made in a range of materials. Some are available as standard, off-the-shelf sections, notably structural steel, extruded aluminum alloy, pultruded GFRP (glass fiber reinforced polyester, or epoxy), and structural timber. Figure 9.8 shows values for I and A (the same axes as in Figure 9.6) for 1,880 standard sections made from these four materials, with contours of the shape factor φeB superimposed. Some of the sections have φeB ≈ 1; they are the ones with solid cylindrical or square sections. More interesting is that none have values of φeB greater than about 65; there is an upper limit for the shape. A similar plot for Z and f A (the axes of Figure 9.7) indicates an upper limit for φB of about 15. When these data are segregated by material, 2 it is found that each has its own upper limit of shape and that they differ greatly. Similar limits hold for the torsional shape factors. They are listed in Table 9.4 and were plotted as shaded bands on Figures 9.6 and 9.7. 2<br>\n <br>\n Birmingham &amp; Jobling (1996); Weaver &amp; Ashby (1997).<br>\n <br>\n 257<br>\n <br>\n 258<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 9:<br>\n <br>\n Selection of Material and Shape<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 9.8 Log (I ) plotted against log (A) for standard sections of steel, aluminum, pultruded GFRP, and wood.

The procedure of Chapter 9 gives a method for optimizing the coupled choice of material and shape.<br>\n <br>\n 10.9 Summary and Conclusions<br>\n <br>\n The procedure is illustrated in this chapter. Often the designer has available certain stock materials in certain shapes. If so, the one with the greatest value of the appropriate material index (of which a number were listed in Table 10.1) maximizes performance. Sometimes sections can be specially designed; then material properties and design loads determine a maximum practical value for the shape factor above which local buckling leads to failure; again, the procedure gives an optimal choice of material and shape. Further gains in efficiency are possible by combining microscopic with macroscopic shape—something we return to later.<br>\n <br>\n 297<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 11<br>\n <br>\n Designing Hybrid Materials<br>\n <br>\n Composite structure<br>\n <br>\n Sandwich structure<br>\n <br>\n Segmented structure<br>\n <br>\n Cellular structure<br>\n <br>\n Hybrid materials.<br>\n <br>\n Materials Selection in Mechanical Design.

Why do farmers prefer hybrid corn to the natural strain? Mules, after all, are best known for their stubbornness, and—like hybrid corn—they cannot reproduce, so you have to start again for each generation. So—why? Because, although they have some attributes that are not as good as those of their forbears, they have others—hardiness, strength, resistance to disease—that are better. The botanical phrase “hybrid vigor” sums it up. So let us explore the idea of hybrid materials—combinations of two or more materials assembled in such a way as to have attributes not offered by either one alone (Figure 11.1, central circle). Like the mule, we may find that some attributes are less good (the cost, for example), but if the ones we want are better, something is achieved. Particulate and fibrous composites are examples of one type of hybrid, but there are many others: sandwich structures, lattice structures, segmented structures, and more. Here we explore ways of designing hybrid materials, emphasizing the choice of components, their configuration, their relative volume fraction, and their scale (Table 11.1). The new variables expand design space, allowing the creation of new “materials” with specific property profiles. And that highlights one of the challenges. How are we to compare a hybrid like a sandwich with monolithic materials like, say, polycarbonate or titanium? To do this we must think of the sandwich not only as a hybrid<br>\n <br>\n 11.1 Introduction and Synopsis<br>\n <br>\n Steels Cast irons Al-alloys<br>\n <br>\n Metals Cu-alloys Zn-alloys Ti-alloys PE, PP, PET, PC, PS, PEEK PA (nylons)<br>\n <br>\n Aluminas Silicon carbides<br>\n <br>\n Ceramics<br>\n <br>\n Polymers<br>\n <br>\n Composites Sandwiches<br>\n <br>\n Silicon nitrides Zirconias<br>\n <br>\n Polyesters Phenolics Epoxies<br>\n <br>\n Hybrids Cellular structures Segmented structures<br>\n <br>\n Soda glass Borosilicate glass<br>\n <br>\n Isoprene Neoprene Butyl rubber<br>\n <br>\n Glasses<br>\n <br>\n Elastomers<br>\n <br>\n Silica glass Glass ceramics<br>\n <br>\n Natural rubber Silicones EVA<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 11.1 Hybrid materials combine the properties of two (or more) monolithic materials or of one material and space.

The approach adopted here is one of breadth rather than precision. The aim is to assemble methods to allow the properties of alternative hybrids to be scanned and compared, seeking those that best meet a given set of design requirements. Once materials and configuration have been chosen, standard methods such as optimization routines and finite element analyses can be used to refine them. But what the standard methods are not good at is the quick scan of alternative combinations. That is where the approximate methods developed below, in which material and configuration become the variables, pay off.<br>\n <br>\n 301<br>\n <br>\n 302<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 11:<br>\n <br>\n Designing Hybrid Materials<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 11.2 Four configurations for a bridge. The design variables describing the performance of each differ. Optimization of performance becomes possible only when a configuration has been chosen.<br>\n <br>\n The word “configuration” requires elaboration. Figure 11.2 shows four different configurations of bridge. In the first all members are loaded in compression. In the second, members carry both tension and compression, depending on how the bridge is loaded. In the third and fourth, the suspension cables are loaded purely in tension. Any one of these can be optimized, but no amount of optimization will cause one to evolve into another because this involves a discrete jump in configuration, each characterized by its own set of variables.1 Hybrid design has the same feature: The classes of hybrid are distinguished by their configuration. Here we focus on four classes, each with a number of discrete members. The images on the first page of this chapter suggest what they look like. To avoid a mouthful of words every time we refer to one, we use the shorthand: composite, sandwich, cellular, and segmented structures. Composites combine two solid components, one (the reinforcement) as fibers or particles, contained in the other (the matrix). Their properties are some average of those of the components, and, on a scale large compared to that of the reinforcement, they behave as if they were homogeneous materials. Sandwiches have outer faces of one material supported by a core of another, usually a low-density material—a configuration that gives a flexural stiffness per unit weight that is greater than that offered by either component alone. 1 Numerical tools are emerging that allow a degree of topological optimization, that is, the development of a configuration. They work like this. Start with an envelope—a set of boundaries—and fill it with a homogenous “material” with a relative density initially set at 0.5, with properties that depend linearly on relative density. Impose constraints, meaning the mechanical, thermal, and other loads the structure must support, give it a criterion of excellence, and let it condense out into regions of relative density 1 and regions where it is 0 retaining only changes that increase the measure of excellence. The method is computationally intensive but has had some success in suggesting configurations that use a material efficiently (see “Further reading” for more information).<br>\n <br>\n 11.2 Holes in Material-property Space<br>\n <br>\n Cellular structures are combinations of material and space (which can, of course, be filled with another material). We distinguish two types: In the first, the low connectivity of the struts allows them to bend when the lattice is loaded; in the other, the higher connectivity suppresses bending, forcing the struts to stretch. Segmented structures are materials subdivided in one, two, or three dimensions; the subdivisions both lower the stiffness and, by dividing the material into discrete units, impart damage tolerance. The approach we adopt is to use bounding methods to estimate the properties of each configuration. With these, the properties of a given pair of materials in a given configuration can be calculated. These can then be plotted on material selection charts, which become tools for selecting both configuration and material.<br>\n <br>\n 11.2 HOLES IN MATERIAL-PROPERTY SPACE All the charts of Chapter 4 have one thing in common: Parts of them are populated with materials and parts are not—there are holes (Figure 11.3). Some parts are inaccessible for fundamental reasons that relate to the size of atoms and the nature of the forces that bind them together. But other parts are empty even though, in principle, they could be filled. Is anything to be gained by developing materials (or material combinations) that lie in these holes? The material indices show where this is profitable. A grid of lines of one index—E/ρ—is plotted in Figure 11.3. If the filled areas can be expanded in the direction of the arrow (i.e., to greater values of E/ρ) it will enable lighter, stiffer structures to be made. The arrow lies normal to the index lines. It defines a vector for material development. One approach to filling holes—the long-established one—is that of developing new metal alloys, new polymer chemistries, and new compositions of glass and ceramic so as to extend the populated areas of the property charts; Figure 1.2 illustrated how this has evolved over time. But developing new materials can be an expensive and uncertain process, and the gains tend to be incremental rather than step-like. An alternative is to combine two or more existing materials so as to allow a superposition of their properties—in short, to create hybrids. The spectacular success of carbon and glass-fiber–reinforced composites at one extreme, and of foamed materials at another (hybrids of material and space) in filling previously empty areas of the property charts is encouragement enough to explore ways in which such hybrids can be designed. What might we hope to achieve? Figure 11.4 shows two materials, M1 and M2, plotted on a chart with properties P1 and P2 as axes. The figure shows four scenarios, each typical of a certain class of hybrid.

Material development that extended the occupied territory in the direction of the arrow (the “vector for development”) allows components with greater stiffness to weight than any current material allows.<br>\n <br>\n configuration of the materials and the way they are combined, we may find any one of the following. ■<br>\n <br>\n ■<br>\n <br>\n “The best of both” scenario. The ideal is often the creation of a hybrid with the best properties of both components. There are examples, most commonly when a bulk property of one material is combined with the surface properties of another. Zinc-coated steel has the strength and toughness of steel with the corrosion resistance of zinc. Glazed pottery exploits the formability and low cost of clay with the impermeability and durability of glass. “The rule of mixtures” scenario. When bulk properties are combined in a hybrid, as in structural composites, the best that can be obtained is often the arithmetic average of the properties of the components, weighted by<br>\n <br>\n 11.3 The Method: “A + B + Configuration + Scale”<br>\n <br>\n ■<br>\n <br>\n These set certain fixed points, but the list is not exhaustive.

Thus unidirectional fiber composites have an axial modulus (the one parallel to the fibers) that lies close to the rule of mixtures. “The weaker link dominates” scenario. Sometimes we have to live with a lesser compromise, typified by the stiffness of particulate composites, in which the hybrid properties fall below those of a rule of mixtures, lying closer to the harmonic than the arithmetic mean of the properties. Although the gains are less spectacular, they are still useful. “The least of both” or weakest-link scenario. Sometimes it is not the greatest but the least of the properties that we seek. Fire sprinkler systems, for example, use a wax-metal hybrid designed to fail, releasing the spray when the melting point of the lower-melting material (the wax) is exceeded.<br>\n <br>\n Rule of mixtures Harmonic mean Least of both<br>\n <br>\n M2 Material Property P1<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 11.4 The possibilities of hybridization. The properties of the hybrid reflect those of its component materials, combined in one of several possible ways.<br>\n <br>\n When is a hybrid a “material”? There is a certain duality in how hybrids are considered and discussed. Some, like filled polymers, composites, or wood are treated as materials in their own right, each characterized by its own set of material properties. Others, such as galvanized steel, are seen as one material (steel) to which a coating of a second (zinc) has been applied, even though it could be regarded as a new material with the strength of steel but the surface properties of zinc (“stinc,” perhaps?). Sandwich panels illustrate the duality, sometimes viewed as two sheets of face material separated by a core material, and sometimes—to allow comparison with bulk materials—as “materials” with their own density, flexural stiffness, and strength. To call any one of these a “material” and to characterize it as such is a useful shorthand, allowing designers to use existing methods when designing with them. But if we are to design the hybrid itself, we must deconstruct it and think of it as a combination of materials (or of material and space) in a chosen configuration.<br>\n <br>\n 11.3 THE METHOD: “A + B + CONFIGURATION + SCALE” First, a working definition: A hybrid material is a combination of two or more materials in a predetermined configuration, relative volume, and scale, optimally serving a specific engineering purpose,” which we paraphrase as “A + B + configuration + scale.” Here we allow for the widest possible choice of A and<br>\n <br>\n 305<br>\n <br>\n 306<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 11:<br>\n <br>\n Designing Hybrid Materials<br>\n <br>\n B, including the possibility that one of them is a gas or simply space. These new design variables expand design space, allowing an optimization of properties that is not possible if the choice is limited to single, monolithic materials. The basic idea, illustrated in Figure 11.5, is this. Monolithic materials offer a certain portfolio of properties on which much engineering design is based. Design requirements isolate a sector of material-property space. If this sector contains materials, the requirements can be met by choosing one of them. But if the design requirements are sufficiently demanding, no single material may be found that can meet them all: The requirements lie in a hole in property space. Then the way forward is to identify and separate the conflicting requirements, seeking optimal material solutions for each, and then combine them in ways that retain the desirable attributes of both. The best choice is the one that ranks most highly when measured by the performance metrics that motivate the design: minimizing mass or cost or maximizing some aspect of performance (criterion of excellence). The alternative combinations are examined and assessed, using the criterion of excellence to rank them. The output is a specification of a hybrid in terms of its component materials and their configurations. The four classes of hybrid structures—composites, sandwiches, cellular, and segmented—are explored in the next four sections, applying the method.<br>\n <br>\n One material meets all<br>\n <br>\n Choice of congifuration Composite Sandwich Lattice Segment<br>\n <br>\n Analyze requirements Functions Constraints<br>\n <br>\n No material meets all separate functions<br>\n <br>\n Function 1 seek optimal solution Function 2 seek optimal solution<br>\n <br>\n Combine solutions and assess performance<br>\n <br>\n Interface engineering Welding Adhesives Fasteners<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 11.5 The steps in designing a hybrid to meet given design requirements.<br>\n <br>\n Simple solution<br>\n <br>\n Hybrid solution<br>\n <br>\n 11.4 Composites<br>\n <br>\n 11.4 COMPOSITES Aircraft engineers, automobile makers, and designers of sports equipment all have one thing in common: They all want materials that are stiff, strong, tough, and light. The single-material choices that best achieve this are the light alloys: alloys that are based on magnesium, aluminum, and titanium. Much research aims at improving their properties. But they are not all that light— polymers have much lower densities. Nor are they all that stiff—ceramics are much stiffer and, particularly in the form of small particles or thin fibers, much stronger. These facts are exploited in the family of structural hybrids that we usually refer to as particulate and fibrous composites. Any two materials can, in principle, be combined to make a composite, and they can be mixed in FIGURE 11.6 many geometries (Figure 11.6). In this section we Schematic of hybrids of the composite type: unidirectional fibrous, laminated fiber, chopped fiber, and particulate restrict the discussion to fully dense, strongly bonded composites. Bounds and limits, described in the text, bracket composites such that there is no tendency for the the properties of all of these. components to separate at their interfaces when the composite is loaded, and to those in which the scale of the reinforcement is large compared to that of the atom or molecule size and the dislocation spacing, allowing the use of continuum methods. On a macroscopic scale—one that is large compared to that of the components —a composite behaves like a homogeneous solid with its own set of mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. Calculating these precisely can be done, but is difficult. It is much easier to bracket them by bounds or limits: upper and lower values between which the properties lie. The term “bound” will be used to describe a rigorous boundary, one that the value of the property cannot— subject to certain assumptions—exceed or fall below. It is not always possible to derive bounds; the best that can be done is to derive “limits” outside which it is unlikely that the value of the property lies. The important point is that the bounds orlimits bracket the properties of all the configurations of matrix and reinforcement shown in Figure 11.6; by using them we escape from the need to model individual geometries. Criteria of excellence We need criteria of excellence to assess any given hybrid’s merit. These are provided by the material indices of Chapter 5. If a possible hybrid has a value of any one of these that exceeds those of existing materials, it achieves our goal.<br>\n <br>\n 307<br>\n <br>\n 308<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 11:<br>\n <br>\n Designing Hybrid Materials<br>\n <br>\n Density When a volume fraction f of a reinforcement r (density ρ r ) is mixed with a volume fraction (1 − f ) of a matrix m (density ρm) to form a composite with no residual porosity, the composite density e ρ is given exactly by a rule of mixtures (an arithmetic mean weighted by volume fraction): e ρ = f ρr + ð1− f Þρm:<br>\n <br>\n (11.1)<br>\n <br>\n The geometry or shape of the reinforcement does not matter except in determining the maximum packing fraction of reinforcement and thus the upper limit for f. Modulus The modulus of a composite is bracketed by the well-known Voigt and Reuss bounds. The upper bound, e Eu , is obtained by postulating that, on loading, the two components suffer the same strain; the stress is then the volume average of the local stresses, and the composite modulus follows a rule of mixtures: e Eu = f Er + ð1− f ÞEm :<br>\n <br>\n (11.2a)<br>\n <br>\n Here Er is the Young’s modulus of the reinforcement and E m that of the matrix. The lower bound, e EL , is found by postulating instead that the two components carry the same stress; the strain is the volume average of the local strains, and the composite modulus is e EL =<br>\n <br>\n Em Er f Em + ð1− f ÞEr<br>\n <br>\n (11.2b)<br>\n <br>\n More precise bounds are possible, but the simple ones are adequate to illustrate the method. To see how the bounds are used, consider the following example.<br>\n <br>\n Composite design for stiffness at minimum mass A beam is at present made of an aluminum alloy. Beryllium is both lighter and less dense than aluminum; the ceramic alumina (Al2O3) is also stiffer but denser. Can hybrids of aluminum with either of these offer improved performance, measured by the criterion of excellence E 1/2 /ρ derived in Chapter 5? The three materials are plotted on a segment of the E − ρ property space in Figure 11.7. Composites made by mixing them have densities given exactly by Equation (11.1) and moduli that are bracketed by the bounds of Equations (11.2a) and (11.2b). Both of these moduli depend on the volume fraction of reinforcement and, through this, on the density. Upper and lower bounds for the modulus-density relationship can thus be plotted on the E − ρ chart using volume fraction f as a parameter, as shown in Figure 11.7.

Bounds for the moduli of hybrids made by mixing them are shown. The diagonal contours plot the criterion of excellence E1/2/ρ. with alumina will have a modulus contained in the envelope for Al–Al2O3; the same for Al-Be. Fibrous reinforcement gives a modulus in a direction parallel to the fibers near the upper bound; particulate reinforcement or transversely loaded fibers give moduli near the lower one. The criterion of excellence, E1/2/ρ, is plotted as a grid in the Figure 11.7. The bound-envelope for Al–Be composites extends almost normal to the grid, while that for Al–Al 2 O 3 lies at a shallow angle to it. Beryllium fibers improve performance (as measured by E1/2/ρ) roughly four times as much as alumina fibers do, for the same volume fraction. The difference for particulate reinforcement is even more dramatic. The lower bound for Al-Be lies normal to the contours: 30% of particulate beryllium increases E1/2/ρ by a factor of 1.5. The lower bound for Al–Al2O3 is, initially, parallel to the E1/2/ρ grid: 30% of particulate Al2O3 gives almost no gain. The underlying reason is that both beryllium and Al2O3 increase the modulus, but only beryllium decreases the density; the criterion of excellence is more sensitive to density than to modulus. The commercial alloy AlBeMet (62% Be, 38% Al) exploits this idea. The two metals are mutually insoluble, creating a 2-phase composite of Al and Be with E1/2/ρ = 6.5 compared with 3.1 for Al alone.<br>\n <br>\n Strength Of all the bounds and limits described in this chapter, those for strength are the least satisfactory. The nonlinearity of the problem, the<br>\n <br>\n 309<br>\n <br>\n 310<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 11:<br>\n <br>\n Designing Hybrid Materials<br>\n <br>\n (b)<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 11.8 Failure modes in composites.<br>\n <br>\n multitude of failure mechanisms 2 and the sensitivity of strength and toughness against impurities and processing defects makes accurate modeling difficult. The literature contains many calculations for special cases: reinforcement by unidirectional fibers or by a dilute dispersion of spheres. We wish to avoid models that require detailed knowledge of how a particular architecture behaves, and we seek less restrictive limits. As the load on a continuous fiber composite is increased, it is redistributed between the components until one suffers general yield or fracture (Figure 11.8(a)). Beyond this point the composite has suffered permanent deformation or damage but can still carry load; final failure requires yielding or fracture of both. The composite is strongest if both reach their failure state simultaneously. Thus the upper bound for a continuous fiber ply like that labeled “Unidirectional” in Figure 11.6 loaded parallel to the fibers (the axial strength in tension, subscript a) is a rule of mixtures: ðe σ f Þu,a = f ðσ f Þr + ð1 − f Þðσ f Þm<br>\n <br>\n (11.3a)<br>\n <br>\n 2 The treatment here is the simplest that allows the method to be demonstrated.

Thus a lower bound for strength in tension is given by ðe σ f ÞL,a = Greater of ð f ðσ f Þr , ð1 − f Þðσ f Þm Þ<br>\n <br>\n (11.3b)<br>\n <br>\n Creating anisotropy The elastic and plastic properties of bulk monolithic solids are frequently anisotropic, but weakly so—the properties do not depend strongly on direction. Hybridization gives a way of creating controlled anisotropy, and it can be large. We have already seen an example in Figure 11.7, which shows the upper and lower bounds for the moduli of composites. The longitudinal properties of unidirectional long-fiber composites lie near the upper bound; the transverse properties, near the lower one. The vertical width of the band between them measures the anisotropy. A unidirectional continuous-fiber composite has a maximum anisotropy ratio Ra given by the ratio of the bounds—in this example   e E E E Ra = u = f 2 + ð1 − f Þ2 + f ð1 − f Þ m + r eL Er Em E In Figure 11.7 the maximum R a is only 1.5. A more dramatic example involving thermal properties is given in Chapter 12.<br>\n <br>\n Determining the transverse strength (Figure 11.8(b)) is more difficult. It depends on interface bond strength, fiber distribution, stress concentrations, and voids. In general the transverse strength is less than that of the unreinforced matrix, and the strain to failure, too, is less. In a continuous ductile matrix containing strongly bonded, nondeforming, particles or fibers, the flow in the matrix is constrained. The constraint increases the stress required for flow in the matrix, giving an upper-limiting tensile strength of 8   &lt; 1 ðe σ f Þu,t ≈ ðσ f Þm (11.4a) Lesser of 1 − f 1/2 : ðe σ f Þu,t ≈ ðσ f Þr More usually the transverse strength is lower than that of the matrix alone because of stress concentration and debonding at the fiber-matrix interface.

The kinking is resisted by the shear strength of the matrix, approximately (σf)m/2. This leads an axial compressive stress for buckling of fibers of ðe σ c Þu,a =<br>\n <br>\n 1 ðσ f Þm ≈ 14ðσ f Þm θ 2<br>\n <br>\n (11.5)<br>\n <br>\n Here θ is the initial misalignment of the fibers from the axis of compression, in radians. Experiments show that a typical value, in carefully aligned<br>\n <br>\n 11.4 Composites<br>\n <br>\n composites, is θ ≈ 0.035, giving the final value shown on the right of the equation. We identify the upper bound with the lesser of this and Equation (11.3a). When, instead, misalignment is severe, meaning θ ≈ 1, the strength falls greatly. We identify the lower bound for compressive failure with that of the matrix, (σf)m. Specific heat The specific heats of solids at constant pressure, C p , are almost the same as those at constant volume, Cv. If they were identical, the heat capacity per unit volume of a composite would, like the density, be given exactly by a rule-of-mixtures: e p = f ρr ðCp Þ + ð1− f Þρm ðCpÞm e ρC r<br>\n <br>\n (11.6)<br>\n <br>\n where (Cp)r is the specific heat of the reinforcement and (Cp)m is that of the matrix (the densities enter because the units of Cp are J/kg.K). A slight difference appears because thermal expansion generates a misfit between the components when the composite is heated; the misfit creates local pressures on the components and thus changes the specific heat. The effect is very small and need not concern us further. Thermal expansion coefficient The thermal expansion of a composite can, in some directions, be greater than that of either component; in others, less. This is because an elastic constant—Poisson’s ratio—couples the principal elastic strains; if the matrix is prevented from expanding in one direction (by embedded fibers, for instance), then it expands more in the transverse directions. For simplicity we shall use the approximate lower bound: e αL =<br>\n <br>\n Er αr f + Em αm ð1 − f Þ Er f + Em ð1 − f Þ<br>\n <br>\n (11.7)<br>\n <br>\n (it reduces to the rule of mixtures when the moduli are the same) and the upper bound: e αu = f αr ð1 + vr Þ + ð1 − f Þαm ð1 + vm Þ − αL 1⁄2 fvr + ð1− f Þvm <br>\n <br>\n (11.8)<br>\n <br>\n where αr and αm are the two expansion coefficients and vr and vm are the Poisson’s ratios. Thermal conductivity Thermal conductivity determines heat flow at a steady rate. A composite of two materials, bonded to give good thermal contact, has a thermal conductivity λ that lies between those of the individual components, λ m and λ r . Not surprisingly, a composite containing parallel continuous fibers has a conductivity, parallel to the fibers, given by a rule of mixtures: e λu = f λr + ð1 − f Þλm<br>\n <br>\n (11.9)<br>\n <br>\n This is an upper bound: In any other direction the conductivity is lower. The transverse conductivity of a parallel-fiber composite (again assuming good<br>\n <br>\n 313<br>\n <br>\n 314<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 11:<br>\n <br>\n Designing Hybrid Materials<br>\n <br>\n bonding and thermal contact) lies near the lower bound first derived by Maxwell:   λr + 2λm − 2f ðλm − λr Þ e λL = λm λr + 2λm + f ðλm − λr Þ<br>\n <br>\n (11.10)<br>\n <br>\n Particulate composites, too, have a conductivity near this lower bound. Poor interface conductivity can make λ drop below it. Debonding or an interfacial layer between reinforcement and matrix can cause this; so, too, can a large difference of modulus between reinforcement and matrix (because this reflects phonons, creating an interface impedance) or a structural scale that is shorter than the phonon wavelengths. Thermal diffusivity The thermal diffusivity a=<br>\n <br>\n λ ρCp<br>\n <br>\n determines heat flow when conditions are transient, that is, when the temperature field changes with time. It is formed from three of the earlier properties: λ, ρ, and Cp. The second and third of these are given exactly by Equations (11.1) and (11.6), allowing the diffusivity to be expressed as e a=<br>\n <br>\n e λ f ρr ðCp Þr + ð1 − f Þρm ðCp Þm<br>\n <br>\n (11.11)<br>\n <br>\n Its upper and lower bounds are found by substituting those for e λ (Equations (11.9) and (11.10)) into this equation.<br>\n <br>\n Composite design for controlled thermal response Thermo-mechanical design involves the specific heat,Cp, the thermal expansion, α, the conductivity, λ, and the diffusivity, a. These composite properties are bounded by Equations (11.6) through (11.11). They are involved in a number of indices. One is the criterion for minimizing thermal distortion derived in Section 6.16: maximizing the index λ/α. Figure 11.10 shows a small part of the α − λ materials selection chart, with a grid showing the criterion of excellence, λ/α, superimposed on it. Three materials are shown: aluminum, boron nitride (BN), and silicon carbide (SiC). The thermal properties of Al–BN and Al–SiC composites are bracketed by envelopes calculated from the bounding equations. (Both α and λ have upper and lower bounds so there are four possible combinations for each material pair. Those shown in the figure are the outermost pair of the four.) The plot reveals immediately that SiC reinforcement in aluminum increases performance (as measured by λ/α); reinforcement with BN decreases it.<br>\n <br>\n 11.4 Composites<br>\n <br>\n 100<br>\n <br>\n 106<br>\n <br>\n Linear expansion coefficient α (10 − 6/K)<br>\n <br>\n Composite design<br>\n <br>\n 3 × 106<br>\n <br>\n Conductivity/Expansion<br>\n <br>\n 107<br>\n <br>\n Criterion of excellence λ/α<br>\n <br>\n 50<br>\n <br>\n 1000 series aluminum alloys<br>\n <br>\n Bound α u, λ l<br>\n <br>\n 20<br>\n <br>\n Boron nitride<br>\n <br>\n 10<br>\n <br>\n 3 × 107 Bound α l, λ u<br>\n <br>\n Bound α l, λ u 108<br>\n <br>\n Bound α u, λ l<br>\n <br>\n 5<br>\n <br>\n Silicon carbide MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n 2 10<br>\n <br>\n 30<br>\n <br>\n 70<br>\n <br>\n 100<br>\n <br>\n 300<br>\n <br>\n 700<br>\n <br>\n Thermal conductivity λ (W/m.K)<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 11.10 A part of expansion-coefficient/conductivity space showing aluminum alloys, boron nitride, and silicon carbide.

Electrical conductivity and percolation When the electrical conductivities κ of the components of a composite are of comparable magnitude, bounds for the electrical conductivity are given by those for thermal conductivity with λ replaced by κ. When, instead, they differ by many orders of magnitude (a metallic powder dispersed in an insulating polymer, for instance), questions of percolation arise. Percolation is discussed in Section 12.3. Filling property space with composites We end this section with two figures illustrating how the development of composites has filled out the occupancy of material-property space. The first, Figure 11.11, is a modulusdensity (E − ρ) section. The areas filled by unreinforced metals and polymers appear as pale red and pale blue envelopes; members are labeled in gray (they are taken from the original E − ρ chart in Figure 4.3).

Using any one of the indices for light, stiff structures (E/ρ, E 1/2/ρ and E 1/3 /ρ) as a criterion of excellence, we find that composites offer performance that was not previously attainable. Figure 11.12 paints a similar picture for the strength-density (σy − ρ) section. The color coding is the same as that in Figure 11.11.

The separation of the faces by the core increases the moment of inertia of the section, I, and its section modulus, Z, producing a structure that resists bending and buckling loads well. Sandwiches are used where weight saving is critical: in aircraft, trains, motor vehicles, portable structures, and sports equipment. Nature, too, makes use of sandwich designs: Sections through the human skull, the wing of a bird, and the stalk and leaves of many plants show a low-density foam-like core separating solid faces.3<br>\n <br>\n Faces: material A<br>\n <br>\n d<br>\n <br>\n t c<br>\n <br>\n Core: material B b<br>\n <br>\n t L<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 11.13 The sandwich.

The core, of thickness c, occupies most of the volume; it must be light and stiff and strong enough to carry the shear stresses necessary to make the whole panel behave as a load-bearing unit, (if the core is much thicker than the faces, these stresses are small). A sandwich as a “material” So far we have spoken of the sandwich as a structure: faces of material A supported on a core of material B, each with its own density, modulus, and strength. But we can also think of it as a material with its own set of properties, and this is useful because it allows comparison with more conventional materials. To do this we calculate equivalent material properties for the sandwich, and we identify them, like composites, by a tilde (e.g., e ρ, e E). The quantities e ρ and e E can be plotted on the modulus-density chart, allowing a direct comparison with all the other materials on the chart. All the constructions using material indices apply unchanged. The symbols that appear in this section are defined in Table 11.2.<br>\n <br>\n Finding equivalent properties of structured materials by experiment Consider a sandwich structure with solid skins separated by a cellular core.

Mechanical properties Sandwich panels are designed to be stiff and strong during bending. In thinking of the panel as a “material,” we must therefore distinguish the in-plane modulus and strength from those in bending. The σ in-plane are given, to an adequate effective in-plane modulus e Ein-plane and strength e approximation, by the rule of mixtures. Equivalent flexural modulus Flexural properties are quite different. The flexural compliance (the reciprocal of the stiffness) has two contributions: one from the bending of the panel as a whole, the other from the shear of the core (Figure 11.14). They add.

For the conditions chosen here, face buckling dominates for f &lt; 0.025; face yield dominates from f = 0.025 to f = 0.1, when a switch to core shear takes place.

Polymer foams have very low dielectric constants, so sandwiches with GFRP faces and polymer foam cores allow the construction of stiff, strong shells with exceptionally low dielectric loss. In-plane electrical conductivity, too, follows a rule of mixtures. Through-thickness electrical conductivity, like that of heat, is described by the harmonic mean—that is, the equivalent of Equation (11.24). Filling property space with sandwich structures We end this section, as we did the last, with two figures illustrating how sandwich structures can expand the occupancy of material-property space. The first, Figure 11.20, is a flexural modulus-density (E − ρ) section. The areas filled by metals, polymers, ceramics, composites and foams appear as pale envelopes; members are labeled in gray.

The properties of the gas might at first seem irrelevant, but this is not so. The thermal conductivity of low-density foams of the sort used for insulation is determined by the conductivity of the gas contained in its pores; and the dielectric constant and breakdown potential, and even the compressibility, can depend on the gas properties. There are two distinct species of cellular solid. The distinction is most obvious in their mechanical properties. The first, typified by foams, are bendingdominated structures; the second, typified by triangulated lattice structures, are stretch dominated—a distinction explained more fully next. To give an idea of<br>\n <br>\n 11.6 Cellular Structures: Foams and Lattices<br>\n <br>\n the difference: A foam with a relative density of 0.1 (meaning that the solid cell walls occupy 10% of the volume) is less stiff by a factor of 10 than a triangulated lattice of the same relative density. The word “configuration” has special relevance here. Foams: Bending-dominated structures Foams are cellular solids made by expanding polymers, metals, ceramics, or glasses with a foaming agent—a generic term for one of many ways of introducing gas, much as yeast does in breadmaking. Figure 11.22 shows an idealized cell of a low-density foam. It consists of solid cell walls or edges surrounding a void space containing a gas or fluid. Cellular solids are characterized by their relative density, which for the structure shown here (with t 0 and it behaves as an almost isotropic, stretch-dominated structure.

Their mechanical response depends on their structure. Foams are usually bending-dominated and lie along a line of slope 2 on this chart. Micro-truss structures are stretch-dominated and lie on a line of slope 1. Both extend the occupied area of this chart by many decades.<br>\n <br>\n 335<br>\n <br>\n 336<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 11:<br>\n <br>\n Designing Hybrid Materials<br>\n <br>\n shows the modulus-density (E − ρ) section through material-property space. The polymer foam envelope is extended along a line of slope 2, as predicted by Equation (11.29). Lattice structures, by contrast, extend along a line of slope 1, as Equation (11.40) predicts. Both fill areas of E − ρ space that are not filled by solid materials. Lattice structures push the filled area to higher values of the indices E1/2 /ρ<br>\n <br>\n and<br>\n <br>\n E1/3 /ρ<br>\n <br>\n 11.7 SEGMENTED STRUCTURES Subdivision as a design variable Shape can be used to reduce flexural stiffness and strength as well as to increase them. Springs, suspensions, flexible cables, and other structures that must flex yet have high tensile strength use shape to give a low bending stiffness. This is achieved by shaping the material into strands or leaves, as explained in Section 10.7. The slender strands or leaves bend easily but do not stretch when the section is bent: an n-strand cable is less stiff by a factor of 3/πn than the solid reference section; an n-leaf panel by a factor 1/n2. Subdivision allows mixing. If one or more of the segments is replaced by a second material, combinations can be created that have property combinations not found in monolithic materials. The method is best illustrated by the example that follows. Subdivision can be used in another way: to impart damage tolerance. A glass window, hit by a projectile, will shatter. One made of small glass bricks, laid as bricks usually are, will lose a brick or two but not shatter totally; it is damagetolerant. By subdividing and separating the material, a crack in one segment does not penetrate into its neighbors, allowing local but not global failure. This is the principle of “topological toughening.” Builders in stone and brick have exploited the idea for thousands of years: Stone and brick are brittle, but buildings made of them—even those made without cement (“dry-stone building”)—survive ground movement, even small earthquakes, through their ability to deform with some local failure but without total collapse.<br>\n <br>\n Materials for long-span power cables In the design of suspended power cables, the objectives are to minimize electrical resistance and at the same time maximize the strength since this allows the greatest span. This is an example of multiobjective optimization, discussed in Chapter 7. As explained there, each objective is expressed, by convention, such that a minimum for it is sought. We thus seek materials with the lowest values of resistivity ρe and the reciprocal of yield strength, 1/σy.<br>\n <br>\n 11.7 Segmented Structures<br>\n <br>\n Figure 11.29 shows the result: Materials that best meet the design requirements lie toward the bottom left. But here there is a hole: All 1700 metals and alloys plotted here have properties that lie above the broken red line, none below. Those with the lowest resistance— copper, aluminum, and certain of their alloys—are not very strong; those that are strongest— drawn carbon and low-alloy steel—do not conduct very well. Now consider a cable made by interleaving strands of copper and steel such that each occupies half the cross-section. If the steel carries no current and the copper no load (the most pessimistic scenario), the performance of the cable will lie at the point shown on the figure—it has twice the resistivity of the copper and half the strength of the steel. It lies in a part of property space that was empty, offering performance not previously possible. Other ratios of copper to steel fill other parts of the space; by varying the ratio, the shaded envelope in the figure is covered. Similar hybrids of aluminum and steel fill a different area, as is easily seen by repeating the construction using “1000 series Al alloys” in place of “OFHC copper, hard” in the combination. Their combinations of ρe and σy are less good, but they are lighter and cheaper and for this reason are widely used.<br>\n <br>\n Factor 2<br>\n <br>\n 10−1<br>\n <br>\n Strength – Resistivity<br>\n <br>\n 1/Yield strength (1/MPa)<br>\n <br>\n Envelope of best solutions Pure aluminum Populated region<br>\n <br>\n 1000 series Al, hard drawn<br>\n <br>\n 10−2<br>\n <br>\n OFHC copper, soft OFHC copper, hard Copper-chromium alloys<br>\n <br>\n 10−3<br>\n <br>\n Factor 2<br>\n <br>\n Hybrid: 50% copper 50% steel<br>\n <br>\n High carbon steel HSLA steel Medium carbon steel<br>\n <br>\n 10−4 0.1<br>\n <br>\n 1<br>\n <br>\n 10 Electrical resistivity (μ Ω.cm)<br>\n <br>\n 100<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 11.29 Designing a hybrid–here one with high strength and high electrical conductivity.

(a) Bricklike assemblies of rectangular blocks carry axial compression, but not tension or shear. (b) The 2-dimensional interlocking of a jigsaw puzzle carries in-plane loads. (c) Units that, when assembled into a continuous layer and clamped within a rigid boundary around the edges of the layer, can carry out-of-plane loads and bending moments.<br>\n <br>\n Taking the simplest view, two things are necessary in order to have topological damage tolerance: discreteness of the structural units and an interlocking of the units in such a way that the array as a whole can carry a load. Brick-like arrangements (Figure 11.30(a) carry large loads and are damage-tolerant in compression and shear, but disintegrate under tension. Strand- and layer-like structures are damage-tolerant in tension because if one strand fails, the crack does not penetrate its neighbors—the principle of multistrand ropes and cables. The jigsaw puzzle configuration (Figure 11.30(b)) carries in-plane tension, compression and shear, but at the cost of introducing a stress pffiffiffiffiffiffiffi concentration factor of about R/r , where R is the approximate radius of a unit and r that of the interlock.<br>\n <br>\n The sources listed in Section 11.9 explore a particular set of topologies that rely on compressive or rigid boundary conditions to create continuous layers that tolerate out-of-plane forces and bending moments, illustrated in Figure 11.30(c). This is done by creating interlocking units with nonplanar surfaces that have curvature both in the plane of the array and normal to it. Provided the array is constrained at its periphery, the nesting shapes limit the relative motion of the units, locking them together. Topological interlocking of this sort allows the formation of continuous layers that can be used for ceramic claddings or linings to give surface protection. And of course the units need not be made of one material alone. Since the only requirement is that of interlocking shape, the segments can be made of different materials. Just as a builder constructing a brick wall can use porous bricks for ventilation and transparent bricks to admit light, the designer of a segmented hybrid can add functionality through the choice of material for the units.<br>\n <br>\n 11.8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The properties of engineering materials can be thought of as defining the axes of a multidimensional space, with each property as a dimension. Chapter 4 showed how this space can be mapped. The maps reveal that some areas of<br>\n <br>\n 11.9 Further Reading<br>\n <br>\n property space are occupied and others are empty—there are holes. The holes can sometimes be filled by making hybrids: combinations of two (or more) materials in a chosen configuration and scale. Design requirements isolate a small box in a multidimensional material-property space. If it is occupied by materials, the requirements can be met. However, if the box hits a hole in any one of the dimensions, we need a hybrid. A number of families of configuration exist, each offering different combinations of functionality. Individual configurations are characterized by a set of bounds, bracketing their effective properties. The methods developed in this chapter provide tools for exploring alternative material configuration combinations. Chapter 12 gives examples of their use.<br>\n <br>\n 11.9 FURTHER READING Hybrid materials—general Bendsoe, M.P., &amp; Sigmund, O. (2003). Topology optimization, theory, methods, and applications.

Each is associated with a set of models that allow its properties to be estimated. In this chapter we illustrate the models’ use to design hybrids to fill specified needs—needs that cannot be filled by single material choices. The cover picture is a reminder of the widespread use of hybrids to maximize performance: The yacht is almost entirely made of hybrid materials.<br>\n <br>\n 12.2 DESIGNING METAL MATRIX COMPOSITES The most common state of loading in structures is that of bending. One measure of excellence in designing materials to carry bending moments at minimum weight is the index E1/2 /ρ, where E is Young’s modulus and is the ρ the density. Alloys of aluminum and of magnesium rank highly by this criterion; titanium alloys and steels are not as good. How could the performance of magnesium (the best of the lot) be enhanced further?

It is shown as a vertical bar within each envelope. Only the shaded part of the envelope below the bar is accessible. The diagonal lines plot the criterion of excellence, E1/2 /ρ. The combinations with the highest values of this quantity offer the greatest gain in stiffness per unit weight. The results It is immediately apparent that the greatest promise is shown by the composites of magnesium with drawn polyethylene (PE) or carbon fibers; magnesium-SiC is less good. Magnesium-Al2O3 offers almost no gain at all. The method allows the potential of rapidly exploring alternative choices. Postscript Magnesium-PE composites look good and are promising, but there remains the challenge of actually making them. Polyethylene fibers are already used in ropes and cables because of their high stiffness, strength, and low weight. But they are destroyed by temperatures much above 120°C, so casting or sintering of the magnesium around the fibers is not an option. One possibility is to use drawn PE sheets rather than fibers, and fabricate a multilayer laminate by bonding the PE sheets between sheets of magnesium. A second possibility is to explore ternary composites: dispersing magnesium powder in an epoxy and using this mix as the matrix to contain the PE fibers, for example. Otherwise we must fall back on magnesium-carbon, an attractive option.

The material must conform to the curved surfaces between which it is clamped, it must be electrically conducting to prevent charge build-up, and it should be moldable. Table 12.3 summarizes the requirements. The method and results Metals, carbon, and some carbides and intermetallics are good conductors, but they are stiff and cannot be molded (Figure 12.2). Thermoplastic and thermosetting elastomers can be molded and are flexible, but they do not conduct. How are they to be combined? Metal coating of polymers is workable if the product will be used in a protected environment, but coatings are easily damaged.

This can be achieved by dispersing conducting material in a polymer. But how much? And in what shape? Think of mixing conducting and insulating spheres of the same size by shaking them up in a jar. If there are only a few conducting spheres, they do not touch and the array as a whole is an insulator. If each conducting sphere contacts just one other, there is still no connecting path. If, on average, each touches two, there is still no path. Adding more conducting spheres gives larger clusters, but they can be large yet still discrete. For bulk conduction we need connectivity: The array first becomes a conductor when a single trail of contacts links one surface to the other, that is, when the volume fraction f of the conducting spheres reaches the percolation threshold fc. Percolation problems are easy to describe but difficult to solve. Research since 1960 has provided<br>\n <br>\n 345<br>\n <br>\n 346<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 12:<br>\n <br>\n Case Studies: Hybrids<br>\n <br>\n approximate solutions to most of the percolation problems associated with the design of hybrids (see “Further reading” for a review). For simple cubic packing fc = 0.248; for close packing fc = 0.180. For a random array (the sphere shaken in a jar) it is somewhere in between—approximately 0.2.1 Making the spheres smaller smears the transition out. The percolation threshold is still 0.2, but the first connecting path is now thin and extremely devious—it is the only one out of the vast number of almost complete paths that actually connects. Increase the volume fraction and the number of conducting paths increases initially as (f − fc)2, then linearly, reverting to a rule of mixtures. If the particles are very small, as much as 40% may be needed to give good conduction. But a loading of 40% seriously degrades the moldability and flexibility of the polymer. Shape gives a way out. If the spheres are replaced by slender fibers, they touch more easily and the percolation threshold falls. If their aspect ratio is β = L/d (where L is the fiber length, d the diameter), then, empirically, the percolation threshold falls from fc to roughly fc /β1/2 , so an aspect ratio of 9 reduces pc, the volume fraction of the conducting phase, by a factor of 3. The concept of percolation is a necessary tool in designing hybrids. Electrical conductivity works that way; so too does the passage of liquids through foams or porous media—no connected path and no fluid flows; just one (out of a million possibilities) and there is a leak. Add a few more connections and there is a flood. Percolation ideas are particularly important in understanding the transport properties of hybrids: Properties that determine the flow of electricity or heat, of fluid, or of flow by diffusion, especially when the differences in properties of the components are extreme, because it is then that connected paths matter. Figure 12.2 is a chart of electrical resistivity and modulus with metals, polymers, and composites plotted. There is a hole at the lower left where materials with the property combination we want would lie. The pale-green L-shaped envelope encloses the properties of hybrids of rubber with chopped copper wires. The resistivity drops sharply at the percolation threshold, which, for wires, falls to a few percent. The material retains all the flexibility of the elastomer but behaves as a bulk conductor. Postscript Conducting elastomers exploiting these ideas are widely available. Such materials find application in antistatic clothing and mats, as pressure sensing elements, and even as solderless connections. Related case study 12.4 “Extreme combinations of thermal and electrical conduction” 1 These results are for infinite, or at least very large, arrays. Experiments generally give values in the range 0.19 to 0.22, with some variability because of the finite size of the samples.<br>\n <br>\n 12.4 Extreme Combinations of Thermal and Electrical Conduction<br>\n <br>\n 12.4 EXTREME COMBINATIONS OF THERMAL AND ELECTRICAL CONDUCTION Materials that are good electrical conductors are always good thermal conductors too. Copper, for example, excels at both. Most polymers, by contrast, are electrical insulators (meaning that their conductivity is so low that for practical purposes they do not conduct at all), and as solids go they are also poor thermal conductors—polyethylene is an example. Thus the “highhigh” and “low-low” combinations of conduction can be met by monolithic materials, and there are plenty of them. The “high-low” and “low-high” combinations are a different matter: Nature gives us very few of either. The challenge is summarized in Table 12.4: Using only copper and polyethylene, devise hybrid materials that achieve both of these combinations (data for both are in Table 12.5). The method and results Figure 12.3 shows two possible hybrid configurations. Both are of type “composite” but with very different configurations and volume fractions. The first is a tangle of fine copper wires embedded in a PE matrix. To describe its performance we draw on the bounds of Section 11.4. Electrical conductivity requires percolation; as explained in Section 12.3, the percolation threshold is minimized by using conducting wires of high aspect ratio. Above the percolation threshold the conductivity tends toward a rule of mixtures (Equation (11.9), with thermal conductivity replaced by electrical conductivity): e κ1 = f κ cu + ð1 − f Þ κPE<br>\n <br>\n (12.1)<br>\n <br>\n Table 12.4 Requirements for the Conducting Hybrids of Copper and Polyethylene Function Constraint Objective Configuration Free variable<br>\n <br>\n Extreme conduction combinations Materials: copper and polyethylene Maximize difference between electrical and thermal conductivities Free choice Configuration and relative volume fractions of the two materials<br>\n <br>\n Table 12.5 Data for Copper and HDPE Material High conductivity copper High density polyethylene<br>\n <br>\n Electrical Conductivity (1/μΩ.cm) 0.6 1 × 10−25<br>\n <br>\n Thermal Conductivity (W/m.K) 395 0.16<br>\n <br>\n 347<br>\n <br>\n 348<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 12:<br>\n <br>\n Case Studies: Hybrids<br>\n <br>\n Copper<br>\n <br>\n Volume fraction of Thickness of PE = c copper fibers = f Polyethylene Thickness of Cu = 2t<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 12.3 Two alternative configurations of copper and polyethylene, shown here in two dimensions but easily generalized to three.

The second hybrid is a multilayered composite with three orthogonal families of PE sheet separating blocks of copper. We draw again on the bounds of Section 11.4. When the PE layers are thin, the through-thickness thermal resistances add; the same is true of the electrical resistances. This means that both the electrical and thermal conductivities are given by the harmonic means (Equation (11.24)):  e κ2 = e λ2 =<br>\n <br>\n f κCu<br>\n <br>\n <br>\n <br>\n f<br>\n <br>\n λCu<br>\n <br>\n ð1−f Þ + κ PE +<br>\n <br>\n −1<br>\n <br>\n ð1− f Þ λPE<br>\n <br>\n (12.3) −1 (12.4)<br>\n <br>\n The composite properties e κ2 and e λ2 are also plotted in Figure 12.4, giving the lower curve. The shape of the curve is a consequence of the very different ranges of values of the two properties: a factor of 1000 for λ, a factor of 1025 for κ. The two hybrids differ dramatically in their behavior. The hybridization has allowed the creation of “materials” with extreme combinations of conductivities.

How would you make the second type of hybrid?

The quantity e Eflex for the sandwich is given by Equation (11.18) and its through-thickness thermal conductivity is given by Equation (11.24). Simplified equations describing them are assembled in Table 12.7, in which t is the face sheet thickness, d the panel thickness, E f the modulus of the face material, λ f and λ c the conductivities of face and core, and Ks the knock-down factor to allow for core shear, ideally equal to 1 (no shear) but potentially as low as 0.5.<br>\n <br>\n 12.5 Refrigerator Walls<br>\n <br>\n 103 Trade-off surface<br>\n <br>\n Metals<br>\n <br>\n Faces: material A<br>\n <br>\n t ∼ Thermal conductivity λ (W/m.K)<br>\n <br>\n 10<br>\n <br>\n d Core: material B<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n t<br>\n <br>\n 1020 cold rolled steel<br>\n <br>\n Metal foams<br>\n <br>\n 10 Composites 1 Steel – PVC sandwiches 10−1<br>\n <br>\n Polymers<br>\n <br>\n Polymer foams<br>\n <br>\n 2t/d = 0.5 0.2 0.1<br>\n <br>\n 10−2<br>\n <br>\n 10−4<br>\n <br>\n 10−3<br>\n <br>\n 10−2<br>\n <br>\n 0.05<br>\n <br>\n Rigid PVC foam<br>\n <br>\n 10−1<br>\n <br>\n 1 10 ∼ Flexural compliance 1/Eflex (GPa−1)<br>\n <br>\n 102<br>\n <br>\n 103<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 12.6 The blue L-shaped trajectory plots the performance of steel-faced, PVC foam cored sandwiches.

The approximate performance of a sandwich with mild steel faces and a core of rigid foamed PVC is plotted using the equations in the table for four values of skin-to-core thickness; all other values are contained in the blue band. The panel offers combinations of stiffness and insulation that cannot be matched by monolithic metals, composites, polymers, or foams. Other combinations of face and core (aluminum or SMC faces with foamed polystyrene core, for example) can be evaluated efficiently using the same chart. Neither combination performs as well as the steel-polystyrene combination, though both come close. Postscript Adhesive technology has advanced rapidly over the last two decades. Adhesives are now available to bond almost any two materials, and to do so with high bond strength (though some adhesives are expensive). Fabricating the sandwich should not be a problem.

The radome is a thin panel or shell, requiring flexural stiffness and strength but also requiring as low a dielectric constant, εr, as possible. Could hybrids offer better performance than monolithic materials? The method and results Sandwich structures offer flexural stiffness and strength, and allow some control of electrical properties. We therefore explore these, seeking to meet the requirements of Table 12.8. Figure 12.7 shows the flexural strength, σ flex , of foams, polymers, and ceramics, plotted against the dielectric constant, εr. Many polymers have dielectric constants between 2 and 5. Dielectric response is an extensive property—if these polymers are foamed, the dielectric constant of the foam falls linearly with the relative density, approaching 1 at low densities (Equation (11.37)): eεr = 1 + ðεr,s −1Þ<br>\n <br>\n   e ρ ρs<br>\n <br>\n (12.5)<br>\n <br>\n where εr,s is the dielectric constant of the solid of which the foam is made and e ρ/ρs is its relative density. Foams, however, are not very strong. GFRP, with a dielectric constant of 5, is much stronger. Based on a survey of possible faces and cores from among those plotted in Figure 12.7, we choose to explore a sandwich with faces of GFRP and a core of a low-/medium-density expanded polymer foam.

The transition to drive-by-wire control systems will increase this further. Wires have ends; they don’t do much unless the ends are connected to something. The connectors are the problem: They loosen with time until, eventually, the connection is lost. Car makers, responding to market forces, now design cars to run for at least 300,000 kilometers and last, on average, 10 years. The electrical system is expected to operate without servicing for the lifetime of the car. Its integrity is vital: You would not be happy in a drive-by-wire car with loose connectors. With increasing instrumentation on engine and exhaust systems, many of the connectors get hot; some have to maintain good electrical contact at temperatures up to 200°C (see Table 12.9). The primary material choice for connectors today is a copper-beryllium alloy, Cu 2% Be: It has excellent conductivity and the high strength needed to act as a spring to give the required clamping force at the connection. But the maximum long-term service temperature of copper-beryllium alloys is only about 130°C; at higher temperatures, creep relaxation causes the connector to loosen its grip. The challenge: to suggest a way to solve this problem. The method and results The answer is to separate the functions, select the best material for each, check for compatibility, and combine the materials to make a hybrid. So here goes. Function 1: Conduct electricity. Copper excels at this; no other affordable material is as good. Its alloys (among them copper-beryllium) are stronger, but at the cost of some loss of conductivity and a great increase in price. We choose copper to provide the conduction. Function 2: Provide clamping force for the lifetime of the vehicle. The material chosen to fill function 2 will have to be bonded to the copper, and if the combination is not to distort when heated, it must have the same expansion coefficient. Figures 12.8 and 12.9 guide the choice. The first shows the maximum service temperature and expansion coefficient for copper, Cu-2% Be, and a range of steels. The box encloses materials with the same expansion coefficient as copper. Type 302 and 304 austenitic stainless steels match copper in expansion coefficient and can be used at much higher temperatures.

The chart shows that both 302 and 304 stainless steels, in the wrought condition, are almost as good as Cu 2% Be as a spring and considerably cheaper. Postscript The proposed solution, then, is a hybrid of copper and type 302 stainless steel, roll-bonded to form a bilayer like that shown in the inset on both figures. Further detailed design will, of course, be needed to establish the thicknesses of each layer, the best degree of cold work, the formability, and the resistance to the environment in which it will be used. But the method has guided us to a sensible concept, quickly and efficiently.

That is because the saucepan is thin; heat is transmitted through the thickness more quickly than it can be spread transversely to bring the entire pan surface to a uniform temperature. The metals of which saucepans are usually made—cast iron, aluminum, stainless steel, or copper—have thermal conductivities that are isotropic, the same in all directions. What we clearly want is a thermal conductivity that is higher in the transverse direction than in the throughthickness direction. A bilayer (or multilayer) hybrid can achieve this. Table 12.10 summarizes the situation. The method and results Heat transmitted in the plane of a bilayer (Figure 12.10, inset) has two parallel paths; the total heat flux is a sum of<br>\n <br>\n 12.8 Exploiting Anisotropy: Heat-spreading Surfaces<br>\n <br>\n Table 12.10 Design Requirements for the Panel Function Constraint Objective Free variable<br>\n <br>\n Heat-spreading surface Temperature up to 200°C without distortion Maximize thermal anisotropy while maintaining good conduction Choice of materials and their relative thicknesses<br>\n <br>\n Thermal conductivity λ (W/m.K)<br>\n <br>\n 1000<br>\n <br>\n λ⊥<br>\n <br>\n Thermal conductivity λ ||<br>\n <br>\n S-steel<br>\n <br>\n 300<br>\n <br>\n 100<br>\n <br>\n OFHC Copper<br>\n <br>\n Copper<br>\n <br>\n Anistropy ratio = 6.7<br>\n <br>\n Transverse conductivity λ ||<br>\n <br>\n Through-thickness conductivity λ⊥<br>\n <br>\n 30 Type 302 stainless steel<br>\n <br>\n 10<br>\n <br>\n MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n 0<br>\n <br>\n 0.5 1.0 Fraction, f, of copper<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 12.10 Creating anisotropy.

The results Copper is an excellent thermal conductor. We saw, in Case Study 12.7, that the thermal expansion of copper matches that of 302 or 304 stainless steel. The thermal conductivities of the two, however, differ.

The maximum separation between eλ ? and e broadly at f = 0.5 (each material occupies about half the thickness) when the ratio of the two conductivities (the anisotropy ratio) is 6.7.

By efficient we mean that they fulfill the complex requirements posed by the way plants and animals function and that they do so using as little material as possible. Many of these requirements are mechanical in nature: the need to support static and dynamic loads created by the mass of the organism or by wind loading, the need to store and release elastic energy, the need to flex through large angles, and the need to resist buckling and fracture. Virtually all natural materials are hybrids. They consist of a relatively small number of polymeric and ceramic components or building blocks that are often composites themselves. Plant cell walls, for instance, combine cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, and can be lignified; animal tissue consists largely of collagen, elastin, keratin, chitin, and minerals such as salts of calcium or silica. From these limited “ingredients” nature fabricates a remarkable range of structured hybrids. Wood, bamboo, and palm consist of cellulose fibers in a lignin/hemicellulose matrix, shaped to hollow prismatic cells of varying wall thickness. Hair, nail, horn, wool, reptilian scales, and hooves are made<br>\n <br>\n 12.9 The Mechanical Efficiency of Natural Materials<br>\n <br>\n of keratin while insect cuticle contains chitin in a matrix of protein. The dominant ingredient of mollusk shell is calcium carbonate, bonded with a few percent of protein. Dentine, bone, and antler are formed of “bricks” of hydroxyapatite cemented together with collagen. Collagen is the basic structural element for soft and hard tissues in animals, such as tendon, ligament, skin, blood vessels, muscle, and cartilage, often used in ways that exploit shape. From a mechanical point of view, there is nothing very special about the individual building blocks. Cellulose fibers have Young’s moduli that are about the same as those of nylon fishing line, but a lot less than those of steel; and the lignin-hemicellulose matrix in which they are embedded has properties very similar to those of epoxy. Hydroxyapatite has a fracture toughness comparable with that of human-made ceramics; that is to say it is brittle. It is thus the configuration of the components that give rise to the striking efficiency of natural materials. The complex hierarchies of configurations that make up wood and bone are illustrated in Figures 12.11 and 12.12. The stiffness, strength, and toughness of wood derive largely from the stiffness, strength, and toughness of the cellulose molecule, shown on the left of Figure 12.11. Crystalline microfibrils are built up of aligned molecules some 30 to 60 nm in length. These form the reinforcing fibers of the lamellae, the matrix of which is amorphous lignin and hemicellulose. Stacks of lamellae in the four-layer pattern and fiber orientation (right) become the structural material of the cell wall. The fibrils of the primary cell wall interweave randomly, as in cotton wool. In<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 12.11 The hierarchical structure of wood.<br>\n <br>\n 359<br>\n <br>\n 360<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 12:<br>\n <br>\n Case Studies: Hybrids<br>\n <br>\n Lamella C<br>\n <br>\n H R C H O N C R H O N C C H R H H C C N O R N O H C HC H R N C C H O H O N R C R H C H H C C N O N O H<br>\n <br>\n 0.2 nm Alpha chain of proteins<br>\n <br>\n Haversian canal 280 nm Cancellous bone<br>\n <br>\n 1.5 nm Triple helix of collagen molecule<br>\n <br>\n Hydroxyapatite nano-platelets<br>\n <br>\n 250 nm Mineralized collagen fiber<br>\n <br>\n 100–500 μm Osteons<br>\n <br>\n Cortical bone 1–50 mm Compact and cancellous bone<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 12.12 The hierarchical structure of bone.<br>\n <br>\n subsequent layers the fibrils are parallel and closely packed. The outer S1 layer has lamellae with alternate right- and left-handed spiral winding of fibrils. Beneath it, the thicker S 2 layer has fibrils that are more nearly oriented along the axis of the cell. The innermost S3 layer has a lay-up like that of S 1 . The cell as a whole is bonded to its neighbors by the middle lamella (not shown), a lignin-pectin complex devoid of cellulose. There is an interesting parallel between the hierarchical structure of bone and that of wood, despite the great differences in their molecular chemistry (Figure 12.12). The starting point here is the triple-helical structure of the collagen molecule, shown on the left. But—unlike wood—this becomes the matrix, not the reinforcement of the mineralized tissue of bone. Hydroxyapatite nanoplatelets deposit in the nascent tissue and increase in volume fraction over time to produce the mature osteons, with an ordered lay-up of highly mineralized fibers with the strength and stiffness to support structural loads that bone must carry in a mature organism. At the most macro scale, nearly fully dense compact bone provides the outer structure of whole bone while highly porous trabecular bone fills the vertebrae, shell-like bones such as the skull, and the ends of the long bones such as the femur. The same as with engineering materials, the building blocks of natural materials can be grouped into classes: bio-ceramics (calcite, aragonite, hydroxyapatite), biopolymers (the organic building blocks: polysaccharides; cellulose;<br>\n <br>\n 12.9 The Mechanical Efficiency of Natural Materials<br>\n <br>\n and the proteins chitin, collagen, silk, and keratin), and natural elastomers (elastin, resilin, abductin, skin, artery, and cartilage). These combine to give a range of hybrids, among them composites and sandwiches (bone, antler, enamel, dentine, shell, cuttle, and coral), cellular structures (natural cellular materials such as wood, cork, palm, bamboo, trabecular bone), and segmented structures (scales, hair). Their properties, like those of engineering materials, can be explored and compared using material property charts. We conclude this chapter by examining charts for natural hybrids and the building blocks from which they are made. The Young’s modulus–density chart Figure 12.13 shows data for Young’s modulus, E, and density, ρ.

Natural fibers (silk, flax, jute, and the like) have their own envelope, as does mineralized tissue (bone, shell, etc.) and soft tissue (ligament, cartilage, and so forth). Where they differ, the moduli parallel (symbol ||) and perpendicular (symbol ⊥) to the fiber orientation or grain have been plotted separately. Trabecular bone exhibits a particularly wide range of densities; for these, three bubbles for high density (HD), medium density (MD), and low density (LD) are plotted. The familiar stiffness guidelines E/ρ, E/p1/2/ρ, and E1/3/ρ are shown, each representing the material index for a particular mode of loading. The natural polymer with the highest efficiency in tension, measured by the index E/ρ, is cellulose; it exceeds that of steel by a factor of about 2.6. The high values for the fibers flax, hemp, and cotton derive from this. Wood, palm, and bamboo are particularly efficient in bending and resistant to buckling, as indicated by the high values of the flexure index E 1/2/ρ when loaded parallel to the grain. That for balsa wood, for example, can be five times greater than that for steel. The tensile strength–density chart Figure 12.14 shows data for the strength, σf, and density, ρ, of natural materials. The color coding and envelope scheme parallels that of Figure 12.13. For natural ceramics the tensile strength is identified with the flexural strength (modulus of rupture) in the beam-bending symbol (T). For natural polymers and elastomers, the strengths are tensile strengths. And for natural cellular materials, the tensile stress is either the plateau stress, or flexural strength, symbol (T), depending on the nature of the material. Where they differ, the strengths parallel (symbol ||) and perpendicular (symbol ⊥) to the fiber orientation or grain have been plotted separately. Evolution to provide tensile strength would—we anticipate—lead to materials with high values of σf/ρ, where strength in bending or buckling is required 2/3 we expect to find materials with high σ f /ρ. Silk and cellulose have the highest values of σf/ρ; that of silk is even higher than that of carbon fibers. The fibers of flax, hemp, and cotton, too, have high values of this index. 2/3 Bamboo, palm, and wood have high values of σ f /ρ, giving resistance to flexural failure. The Young’s modulus–strength chart Data for the strength, σ f , and modulus, E, of natural materials are shown in Figure 12.15. Two of the combinations are significant. Materials with large values of σ 2f /E store elastic energy and make good springs; those with large values of σf/E have exceptional resilience. Both are plotted in the figure. Silks (including the silks of spider webs) stand out as exceptionally efficient, having values of σ 2f /E that exceed those of spring steel or rubber.

The limited data for the toughness, Jc, and Young’s modulus, E, of natural materials are shown in Figure 12.16.

Their toughness derives from their segmented structure: platelets of ceramics such as calcite, hydroxyapatite or aragonite, bonded by a small volume fraction of polymer, usually collagen; it increases with decreasing mineral content and increasing collagen content.<br>\n <br>\n 12.10 Further Reading: Natural Materials<br>\n <br>\n 100<br>\n <br>\n Toughness – Modulus<br>\n <br>\n Palms (broken lines)<br>\n <br>\n Soft tissue Keratin<br>\n <br>\n Hoof<br>\n <br>\n Horn Antler<br>\n <br>\n Lignum vitae ll Woods Oak ll<br>\n <br>\n (fibrous mode) 100<br>\n <br>\n 10<br>\n <br>\n Corks Trabecular bone (MD)<br>\n <br>\n Toughness (kJ/m2 )<br>\n <br>\n 1<br>\n <br>\n Elm ll Pine ll Trabecular Nut and bone (HD) seed<br>\n <br>\n Cortical bone (L) Bamboo ll Cortical bone (T) Mollusk<br>\n <br>\n Pine Spruce ll Dentine<br>\n <br>\n Willow Trabecular bone (LD)<br>\n <br>\n 0.1<br>\n <br>\n Willow ll Lignum vitae ⊥ Oak ⊥ Balsa ll Elm ⊥ Potato<br>\n <br>\n Trabecular bone (dash-dot lines)<br>\n <br>\n 0.01<br>\n <br>\n Natural cellular materials<br>\n <br>\n Enamel 10<br>\n <br>\n Bio-silica<br>\n <br>\n Hydroxyapatite<br>\n <br>\n Apple<br>\n <br>\n Balsa ⊥<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n Spruce ⊥ Parenchyma Egg shell<br>\n <br>\n Woods (splitting mode)<br>\n <br>\n 30<br>\n <br>\n Dense mineralized tissue<br>\n <br>\n Calcite<br>\n <br>\n Aragonite<br>\n <br>\n Coral<br>\n <br>\n 0.001<br>\n <br>\n 1<br>\n <br>\n Bioceramics Fracture toughness (MPa.m1/2)<br>\n <br>\n 0.0001 0.001<br>\n <br>\n 0.01<br>\n <br>\n 0.1<br>\n <br>\n = 0.01<br>\n <br>\n 0.03<br>\n <br>\n 1 Young’s modulus E (GPa)<br>\n <br>\n 10<br>\n <br>\n 0.1<br>\n <br>\n 100<br>\n <br>\n 0.3 MFA, 10<br>\n <br>\n 1000<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 12.16 A material-property chart for natural materials, plotting toughness against Young’s modulus.

Sand casting, injection molding, fusion welding, and electro-polishing are all processes; there are hundreds of them. The choice, for a given component, depends on the material of which it is to be made; on its size, shape, and required precision; and on how many are to be made—in short, on the design requirements. To select processes we must first classify them. Section 13.2 develops the classification. It is used to structure Section 13.3, in which process families and their attributes are described: the materials they can handle, the shapes they can make, and the precision with which they can do it. Processing has dual functions. The obvious one is that of shaping, joining, and finishing. The less obvious one is that of property control. Metals are strengthened by rolling and forging; steels are heat-treated to enhance hardness and toughness; polymers are drawn to increase modulus and strength; and ceramics are hot-pressed, again to increase strength. Processproperty relationships are explored more closely in Section 13.4. Process selection—finding the best match between process attributes and design requirements—is the subject of Sections 13.5 and 13.6. In using the methods developed there, one should not forget that material, shape and processing interact (Figure 13.1). Material properties and shape limit the choice of<br>\n <br>\n Function Translation, giving Constraints Objectives for selection<br>\n <br>\n Shape<br>\n <br>\n Material<br>\n <br>\n Shape factors<br>\n <br>\n Material families classes, members<br>\n <br>\n Indices that include shape<br>\n <br>\n Material attributes and documentation<br>\n <br>\n Coselection of material + shape<br>\n <br>\n Process Shaping Joining Surface treatment<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.1 Processing selection depends on material and shape. The “process attributes” are used as criteria for selection.<br>\n <br>\n 13.2 Classifying Processes<br>\n <br>\n process: Ductile materials can be forged, rolled, and drawn; those that are brittle may have to be shaped using powder methods. Materials that melt at modest temperatures to low-viscosity liquids can be cast; those that do not have to be processed by other routes. Shape, too, can influence the choice of process. Slender shapes can be made easily by rolling or drawing but not by casting. Hollow shapes cannot be made by forging, but they can by casting or molding. Conversely, processing affects properties. Rolling and forging change the hardness and texture of metals and align the inclusions they contain, enhancing strength and ductility. Heat treatment allows manipulation of strength, ductility, and toughness. Composites do not exist until they are processed; before processing, they are just a soup of polymer and a sheaf of fibers. Like the other aspects of design, process selection is an iterative procedure. The first iteration gives one or more possible process routes. The design must then be rethought to adapt it, as far as possible, to ease manufacture by the most promising route. The final choice is based on a comparison of process cost, requiring the use of cost models developed in Section 13.6, and on documentation: guidelines, case histories, and examples of process routes used for related products. Documentation also helps in dealing with the coupling between process and material properties. The chapter ends, as always, with a summary and annotated recommendations for further reading.<br>\n <br>\n 13.2 CLASSIFYING PROCESSES Manufacturing processes can be classified under the headings shown in Figure 13.2. Primary shaping create shapes. The first row lists six classes of primary forming processes: casting, molding, deformation, powder methods, methods for forming composites, and special methods such as rapid prototyping. Secondary processes modify shapes or properties; here they are shown as “machining,” which adds features to an already shaped body, and “heat treatment,” which enhances surface or bulk properties. Below these come joining an, surface treatment or finishing. Figure 13.2 has merit as a flow chart; it shows a progression through the manufacturing route. It should not be treated too literally, however; the order of the steps can be varied to suit the needs of the design. The point it makes is that there are three broad process families: shaping, joining, and finishing. The attributes of one family differ so greatly from those of another that, in assembling and structuring data for them, they must be treated separately. To organize processes in more detail, we need a hierarchical classification like that used for materials in Chapter 5. Figure 13.3 shows part of it. The process universe has three families: shaping, joining, and finishing. In this figure, the shaping family is expanded to show classes: casting, deformation,<br>\n <br>\n 369<br>\n <br>\n 370<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n Raw materials Primary shaping Casting methods: Sand Die Investment<br>\n <br>\n Molding methods: Injection Compression Blow molding<br>\n <br>\n Secondary processes<br>\n <br>\n Deformation methods: Rolling Forging Drawing<br>\n <br>\n Powder methods: Sintering HIPing Slip casting<br>\n <br>\n Machining: Cut, turn, plane drill, grind<br>\n <br>\n Heat-treat: Quench, temper, age-harden<br>\n <br>\n Composite forming: Hand lay-up Filament winding RTM<br>\n <br>\n Joining<br>\n <br>\n Special methods: Rapid prototype Lay-up Electro-form<br>\n <br>\n Surface treatment<br>\n <br>\n Fastening Riveting<br>\n <br>\n Welding Heat bonding<br>\n <br>\n Polishing Texturing<br>\n <br>\n Plating Metallizing<br>\n <br>\n Snap fits Friction bond<br>\n <br>\n Adhesives Cements<br>\n <br>\n Anodizing Chromizing<br>\n <br>\n Painting Printing<br>\n <br>\n Finished product<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.2 The classes of process.

One of these—molding—is again expanded to show its members: rotation molding, blow molding, injection molding, and so forth. Each of these has certain attributes: the materials it can handle, the shapes it can makes, their size, precision, and an optimum batch size (the number of units that molding can make economically).<br>\n <br>\n Expanding members of the shaping family Expanding the casting family at about the same level of detail as that used for molding in the figure gives the result: 1. 2. 3. 4.<br>\n <br>\n Sand casting Shaping–casting Die casting Investment casting<br>\n <br>\n The other two families are partly expanded in Figure 13.4.

As before, each member has attributes. The first is the materials it can join. After that the attribute list differs from that for shaping. Here the geometry of the joint and the way it will be loaded are important, as are requirements that the joint can or cannot be disassembled, that it be watertight, that it be electrically conducting, and the like. The lower part of the figure expands the family of finishing. Some of the classes it contains are shown; one—coating—is expanded to show some of its members. As with shaping and joining, the material to be coated is an important attribute but the others differ. Most important is the purpose of the treatment (protection, surface hardening, decoration, etc.), followed by properties of the coating itself.<br>\n <br>\n Expanding the joining family Expanding the fasteners family at about the same level of detail as that used for molding in the figure, gives the result: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.<br>\n <br>\n Rivets and staples Joining—fasteners Threaded fasteners Sewing Snap fits<br>\n <br>\n With this background we can embark on a lightning tour of processes. It will be kept as concise as possible; details can be found in the numerous books listed in “Further reading” (Section 13.9).<br>\n <br>\n 13.3 THE PROCESSES: SHAPING, JOINING, FINISHING Shaping processes In casting (Figure 13.5), a liquid is poured or forced into a mold where it solidifies by cooling. Casting is distinguished from molding, which comes next, by the low viscosity of the liquid: It fills the mold by flow under its own weight (as in gravity sand and investment casting) or under a modest pressure (as in die casting and pressure sand casting). Sand molds for oneoff castings are cheap; metal dies for die casting large batches can be expensive. Between these extremes lie a number of other casting methods: shell, investment, plaster mold, and so forth.<br>\n <br>\n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.5 Casting processes. In sand casting, liquid metal is poured into a split sand mold. In die casting, liquid is forced under pressure into a metal mold. In investment casting, a wax pattern is embedded in a refractory, melted out, and the cavity filled with metal. In pressure casting, a die is filled from below, giving control of atmosphere and of the flow of metal into the die.<br>\n <br>\n Cast shapes must be designed for easy flow of liquid to all parts of the mold, and for progressive solidification that does not trap pockets of liquid in a solid shell, giving shrinkage cavities. Whenever possible, section thicknesses are made uniform (the thickness of adjoining sections should not<br>\n <br>\n 373<br>\n <br>\n 374<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n differ by more than a factor of 2). The shape is designed so that the pattern and the finished casting can be removed from the mold. Keyed-in shapes are avoided because they lead to “hot tearing” (a tensile creep fracture) as the solid cools and shrinks. The tolerance and surface finish of a casting vary from poor for sand casting to excellent for precision die castings; they are quantified in Section 13.6. When metal is poured into a mold, the flow is turbulent, trapping surface oxide and debris within the casting, giving casting defects. These are avoided by filling the mold from below in such a way that flow is laminar, driven by a vacuum or gas pressure, as shown in Figure 13.5. Molding Figure 13.6 shows casting, adapted to materials that are very viscous when molten, particularly thermoplastics and glasses. The hot, viscous fluid is pressed or injected into a die under considerable pressure, where it cools and solidifies. The die must withstand repeated application of pressure, temperature, and the wear involved in separating and removing the part, and therefore it is expensive. Elaborate shapes can be molded, but at the penalty of complexity in die shape and in the way it separates to allow removal. The molds for thermo-forming, by contrast, are cheap. Variants of the process use gas pressure or vacuum to press a heated polymer sheet onto a single-part mold. Blow molding, too, uses a gas pressure to expand a polymer or glass blank into a split outer die. It is a rapid, low-cost process well suited for mass production of cheap parts like milk bottles. Polymers, such as metals, can be extruded; virtually all rods, tubes, and other prismatic sections are made in this way. Deformation processing Figure 13.7 shows that the deformation process can be hot, warm, or cold—cold, that is, relative to the melting point Tm of the material being processed. Extrusion, hot forging, and hot rolling (T &gt; 0.55 Tm) have much in common with molding, though the material is a true solid, not a viscous liquid. The high temperature lowers the yield strength and allows simultaneous recrystallization, both of which lower the forming pressures. Warm working (0.35 Tm &lt; T &lt; 0.55 Tm) allows recovery but not recrystallization. Cold forging, rolling, and drawing (T &lt; 0.35 Tm) exploit work hardening to increase the strength of the final product, but at the penalty of higher forming pressures. Forged parts are designed to avoid sudden changes in thickness and sharp radii of curvature since both require large local strains that can cause the material to tear or to fold back on itself (“lapping”). Hot forging of metals allows larger changes of shape but generally gives a poor surface and tolerance because of oxidation and warpage. Cold forging gives greater precision and finish, but forging pressures are higher and the deformations are limited by work hardening.<br>\n <br>\n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.6 Molding processes. In injection molding, a granular polymer (or filled polymer) is heated, compressed, and sheared by a screw feeder, forcing it into the mold cavity. In blow molding, a tubular blank of hot polymer or glass is expanded by gas pressure against the inner wall of a split die. In polymer extrusion, shaped sections are formed by extrusion through a shaped die. In thermo-forming, a sheet of thermoplastic is heated and deformed into a female die by vacuum or gas pressure.<br>\n <br>\n Powder methods Figure 13.8 shows that powder methods create the shape by pressing and then sintering fine particles of the material. The powder can be cold-pressed and then sintered (heated at up to 0.8 Tm to give diffusion bonding); it can be pressed in a heated die (“die pressing”); or, contained in a thin preform, it can be heated under a hydrostatic pressure (“hot isostatic pressing”<br>\n <br>\n 375<br>\n <br>\n 376<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.7 Deformation processes. In forging, a slug of metal is shaped between two dies held in the jaws of a press. In rolling, a billet or bar is reduced in section by compressive deformation between the rolls. In extrusion, metal is forced to flow through a die aperture to give a continuous prismatic shape. All three processes can be hot (T &gt; 0.85 Tm ), warm (0.55 Tm &lt; T &lt; 0.85 Tm ), or cold (T &lt; 0.35 Tm ). In spinning, a spinning disc of ductile metal is shaped over a wooden pattern by repeated sweeps of the smooth, rounded tool.<br>\n <br>\n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.8 Powder processing. In die-pressing and sintering the powder is compacted in a die, often with a binder, and the green compact is then fired to give a more or less dense product. In hot isostatic pressing, powder in a thin, shaped shell or preform is heated and compressed by an external gas pressure. In powder injection molding, powder and binder are forced into a die to give a green blank that is then fired. In slip casting, a water-based powder slurry is poured into a porous plaster mold that absorbs the water, leaving a powder shell that is subsequently fired.<br>\n <br>\n 377<br>\n <br>\n 378<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n or “HIPing”). Metals that are too high-melting to cast and too strong to deform can be made (by chemical methods) into powders and then shaped in this way. But the processes are not limited to “difficult” materials; almost any material can be shaped by subjecting it, as a powder, to pressure and heat. Powder processing is most widely used for small metallic parts like gears and bearings for cars and appliances. It is economic in its use of material; it allows parts to be fabricated from materials that cannot be cast, deformed, or machined; and it can give a product that requires little or no finishing. Since pressure is not transmitted uniformly through a bed of powder, the length of a die-pressed powder part should not exceed 2.5 times its diameter. Sections must be near uniform because the powder will not flow easily around corners. And the shape must be simple and easily extracted from the die. Ceramics, difficult to cast and impossible to deform, are routinely shaped by powder methods. In slip casting, a water-based powder slurry is poured into a plaster mold. The mold wall absorbs water, leaving a semi-dry skin of slurry over its inner wall. The remaining liquid is drained out, and the dired slurry shell is fired to give a ceramic body. In powder injection molding (the way spark-plug insulators are made) a ceramic powder in a polymer binder is molded in the conventional way; the molded part is fired, burning the binder and sintering the powder. Composite forming methods, as shown in Figure 13.9, make polymer-matrix composites reinforced with continuous or chopped fibers. Large components are fabricated by filament winding or by laying up preimpregnated mats of carbon, glass, or Kevlar fiber (“pre-preg”) to the required thickness, pressing, and curing. Parts of the process can be automated, but it remains a slow manufacturing route; and, if the component is a critical one, extensive ultrasonic testing may be necessary to confirm its integrity. Higher integrity is given by vacuum-bag or pressure-bag molding, which squeezes bubbles out of the matrix before it polymerizes. Lay-up methods are best suited to a small number of high-performance, tailor-made components. More routine components (car bumpers, tennis racquets) are made from chopped-fiber composites by pressing and heating a “dough” of resin containing the fibers, known as bulk molding compound (BMC) or sheet molding compound (SMC), in a mold, or by injection molding a rather more fluid mixture into a die. The flow pattern is critical in aligning the fibers, so the designer must work closely with the manufacturer to exploit the composite properties fully. Rapid prototyping systems (RPS) allow single examples of complex shapes to be made from numerical data generated by CAD solid-modeling software (see Figure 13.10). The motive may be that of visualization: The aesthetics of an object may be evident only when viewed as a prototype. It may be<br>\n <br>\n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.9 Composite forming methods. In filament winding, fibers of glass, Kevlar, or carbon are wound onto a former and impregnated with a resin-hardener mix. In roll and spray lay-up, fiber reinforcement is laid up in a mold onto which the resin-hardener mix is rolled or sprayed. In vacuum-bag and pressure-bag molding, laid-up fiber reinforcement, impregnated with resin-hardener mix, is compressed and heated to cause polymerization. In pultrusion, fibers are fed through a resin bath into a heated die to form continuous prismatic sections.<br>\n <br>\n 379<br>\n <br>\n 380<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.10 Rapid prototyping. In deposition modeling and ballistic particle manufacture (BPM), a solid body is created by the layer-by-layer deposition of polymer droplets. In stereo-lithography (SLA), a solid shape is created layer by layer by laser-induced polymerization of a resin. In direct mold modeling, a sand mold is built up layer by layer by selective spraying of a binder from a scanning print-head. In laminated object manufacture (LOM), a solid body is created from layers of paper, cut by a scanning laser beam and bonded with a heat-sensitive polymer.<br>\n <br>\n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing<br>\n <br>\n that of pattern-making: The prototype becomes the master from which molds for conventional processing, such as casting, can be made. Or—in complex assemblies—it may be that of validating intricate geometry, ensuring that parts fit, can be assembled, and are accessible. All RPSs can create shapes of great complexity with internal cavities, overhangs, and transverse features, though the precision, at present, is limited to ± 0.3 mm at best. All RP methods build shapes layer by layer, rather like three-dimensional printing, and are slow (typically 4–40 hours per unit). There are at least six broad classes. 1. The shape is built up from a thermoplastic fed to a single scanning head that extrudes it like a thin layer of toothpaste (fused deposition modeling or FDM), exudes it as tiny droplets (ballistic particle manufacture, BPM), or ejects it in a patterned array like a bubble-jet printer (“3D printing”). 2. Scanned-laser–induced polymerization of a photo-sensitive monomer (stereo-lithography or SLA). After each scan, the work piece is incrementally lowered, allowing fresh monomer to cover the surface. 3. Scanned laser cutting of bondable paper elements. Each paper-thin layer is cut by a laser beam and heat-bonded to the next one. 4. Screen-based technology like that used to produce microcircuits (solid ground curing or SGC). A succession of screens admits UV light to polymerize a photo-sensitive monomer, building shapes layer by layer. 5. Selected laser sintering (SLS) allows components to be fabricated directly in thermoplastic, metal, or ceramic. A laser, as in SLA, scans a bed of particles, sintering a thin surface layer where the beam strikes. A new layer of particles is swept across the surface and the laser-sintering step is repeated, building up a three-dimensional body. 6. Bonded sand molding offers the ability to make large complex metal parts easily. Here a multi-jet print-head squirts a binder onto a bed of loose casting sand, building up the mold shape much as selected laser sintering does, but more quickly. When complete, the mold is lifted from the remaining loose sand and used in a conventional casting process. To be useful, prototypes made by RPS are used as silicone molding masters, allowing replicas to be cast using high-temperature resins or metals. Almost all engineering components, whether made of metal, polymer, or ceramic, are subjected to some kind of machining (Figure 13.11) during manufacture. To make this possible they should be designed to make gripping and jigging easy and to keep the symmetry high: Symmetric shapes need fewer operations. Metals differ greatly in their machinability, a measure of the ease of chip formation, the ability to give a smooth surface, and the ability to give economical tool life (evaluated in a standard test). Poor machinability means higher cost.<br>\n <br>\n 381<br>\n <br>\n 382<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.11 Machining operations. In turning and milling, the sharp, hardened tip of a tool cuts a chip from the work piece surface. In drawing, blanking, and stretching, sheet is shaped and cut to give flat and dished shapes. In electro-discharge machining, electric discharge between a graphite electrode and the work piece, submerged in a dielectric such as paraffin, erodes the work piece to the desired shape. In water-jet cutting, an abrasive entrained in a high-speed water jet erodes the material in its path.<br>\n <br>\n Most polymers are molded into a final shape. When necessary they can be machined but their low moduli mean that they deflect elastically during the machining operation, limiting tolerance. Ceramics and glasses can be ground and lapped to high tolerance and finish (think of the mirrors of telescopes). There are many “special” machining techniques with particular applications<br>\n <br>\n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing<br>\n <br>\n including: electro-discharge machining (EDM), ultrasonic cutting, chemical milling, and cutting by water and sand jets and electron and laser beams. Sheet metal forming involves punching, bending, and stretching. Holes cannot be punched to a diameter less than the thickness of the sheet. The minimum radius to which a sheet can be bent, its formability, is sometimes expressed in multiples of the sheet thickness t: A value of 1 is good; one of 4 is average. Radii are best made as large as possible, and never less than t. The formability also determines the amount the sheet can be stretched or drawn without necking and failing. The forming limit diagram gives more precise information: It shows the combination of principal strains in the plane of the sheet that will cause failure. The part is designed so that the strains do not exceed this limit. Machining is often a secondary operation applied to castings, moldings, or powder products to increase finish and tolerance. Higher finish and tolerance mean higher cost; over-specifying either is a mistake.<br>\n <br>\n Joining processes Joining Figure 13.12 shows that joining is made possible by a number of techniques. Almost any material can be joined with adhesives, though ensuring a sound, durable bond can be difficult. Bolting, riveting, stapling, and snap fitting are commonly used to join polymers and metals, and have the feature that they can be disassembled if need be. Welding, the largest class of joining processes, is widely used to bond metals and polymers; specialized techniques have evolved to deal with each class. Friction welding and friction-stir welding rely on the heat and deformation generated by friction to create a bond between different metals. Ceramics can be diffusionbonded to themselves, to glasses, and to metals. If components are to be welded, the material of which they are made must be characterized by a high weldability. Like machinability, it measures a combination of basic properties. A low thermal conductivity allows welding with a low rate of heat input, but can lead to greater distortion on cooling. Low thermal expansion gives small thermal strains with less risk of distortion. A solid solution is better than an age-hardened alloy because, in the heat-affected zone on either side of the weld, over-aging and softening can occur. Welding always leaves internal stresses that are roughly equal to the yield strength of the parent material. They can be relaxed by heat treatment but this is expensive, so it is better to minimize their effect by good design. To achieve this, parts to be welded are made of equal thickness whenever possible, the welds are located where stress or deflection is least critical, and the total number of welds is minimized.<br>\n <br>\n 383<br>\n <br>\n 384<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.12 Joining operations. In adhesive bonding, a film of adhesive is applied to one surface, which is then pressed onto the mating one. Fastening is achieved by bolting; riveting; stapling; push-through snap fastener; push-on snap fastener; or rod-to-sheet snap fastener. In metal fusion welding, metal is melted, and more is added from a filler rod to give a bond or coating. In thermoplastic polymer welding, heat is applied to the polymer components, which are simultaneously pressed together to form a bond.<br>\n <br>\n The large-volume use of fasteners is costly; welding, crimping, or the use of adhesives can be more economical. Design for assembly (DFA) methods provide a checklist to guide minimizing assembly time.<br>\n <br>\n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing<br>\n <br>\n Finishing processes Finishing involves treatments applied to the surface of the component or assembly. Some aim to improve mechanical and other engineering properties, others to enhance appearance. Finishing treatments to improve engineering properties (Figure 13.13) Grinding, lapping, and polishing increase precision and smoothness, particularly important for bearing surfaces. Electroplating deposits a thin metal layer onto the surface of a component to give resistance to corrosion and abrasion. Plating and painting are both made easier by a simple part shape with largely convex surfaces: Channels, crevices, and slots are difficult to reach. Anodizing, phosphating, and chromating create a thin layer of oxide, phosphate, or chromate on the surface, imparting corrosion resistance. Heat treatment is a necessary part of the processing of many materials. Agehardening alloys of aluminum, titanium, and nickel derive their strength from a precipitate produced by a controlled heat treatment: quenching from a high temperature followed by aging at a lower one. The hardness and toughness of steels are controlled in a similar way: by quenching from the “austenitizing” temperature (about 800°C) and tempering. The treatment can be applied to the entire component, as in bulk carburizing, or just to a surface layer, as in flame hardening, induction hardening, and laser surface hardening. Quenching—very rapid cooling—is a savage procedure; the sudden thermal contraction associated with it can produce stresses large enough to distort or crack the component. The stresses are caused by a nonuniform temperature distribution, and this, in turn, is related to the geometry of the component. To avoid damaging stresses, the section thickness should be as uniform as possible, and nowhere so large that the quench rate falls below the critical value required for successful heat treatment. Stress concentrations should be avoided because they are a source of quench cracks. Materials that have been molded or deformed may contain internal stresses that can be removed, at least partially, by stress-relief anneals—another sort of heat treatment. Finishing treatments that enhance aesthetics (Figure 13.14) The processes just described can be used to enhance the visual and tactile attributes of a material: Electroplating and anodizing are examples. There are many more, of which painting is the most widely used. Organic-solvent–based paints give durable coatings with high finish, but the solvent poses environmental problems. Water-based paints overcome these, but dry more slowly and the resulting paint film is less perfect. In polymer powder-coating and polymer powder-spraying a film of thermoplastic—nylon, polypropylene, or polyethylene—is deposited on the surface, giving a protective layer that can be brightly colored.<br>\n <br>\n 385<br>\n <br>\n 386<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.13 Finishing processes to protect and enhance properties. In mechanical polishing, the roughness of a surface is reduced and its precision increase, by material removal using finely ground abrasives. In electroplating, metal is plated onto a conducting work piece by electro-deposition in a plating bath. In heat treatment, a surface layer of the work piece is hardened and made more corrosion resistant by the inward diffusion of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, or aluminum from a powder bed or molten bath. In anodizing, a surface oxide layer is built up on the work piece (which must be aluminum, magnesium, titanium, or zinc) by a potential gradient in an oxidizing bath.<br>\n <br>\n 13.3 The Processes: Shaping, Joining, Finishing<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.14 Finishing processes to enhance appearance. In paint spraying, a pigment in an organic- or water-based solvent is sprayed onto the surface to be decorated. In polymer powder-coating a layer of thermoplastic is deposited on the surface by direct spraying in a gas flame, or by immersing the hot work piece in a bed of powder. In silk-screen printing, ink is wiped onto the surface through a screen onto which a blocking pattern has been deposited, allowing ink to pass in selected areas only. In pad-printing, an inked pattern is picked up on a rubber pad and applied to the surface, which can be curved or irregular.<br>\n <br>\n In screen printing an oil-based ink is squeegeed through a mesh on which a blocking film holds back the ink where it is not wanted; full-color printing requires the successive use of up to four screens. Screen printing is widely used to apply designs to flat surfaces. Curved surfaces require the use of pad printing,<br>\n <br>\n 387<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n in which a pattern, etched onto a metal “cliche,” is inked and picked up on a soft rubber pad. The pad is pressed onto the product, depositing the pattern on its surface; the compliant rubber conforms to the curvature of the surface.

The modulus and strength of polymers and elastomers depend on the chain length and degree of cross-linking, aspects of structure directly controlled by processing. The strength, particularly, of ceramics depends on porosity, another aspect of microstructure that is directly influenced by processing.<br>\n <br>\n Fracture toughness K1c (MPa.m1/2)<br>\n <br>\n 13.4 Processing for Properties<br>\n <br>\n Polypropylene<br>\n <br>\n 40% long glass fiber<br>\n <br>\n 10<br>\n <br>\n Glass fibers Impact modifiers<br>\n <br>\n 5<br>\n <br>\n 30% PAN carbon fiber 20% long glass fiber<br>\n <br>\n PP with EPR PP copolymer<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n Homopolymer PP<br>\n <br>\n Carbon fibers<br>\n <br>\n Gc = 10 kJ/m2 10% CaCO3<br>\n <br>\n 1<br>\n <br>\n 0.5<br>\n <br>\n 40% Talc<br>\n <br>\n 40% CaCO3<br>\n <br>\n Fillers 20% CaCO3 Gc = 1 kJ/m2<br>\n <br>\n MFA, 10<br>\n <br>\n 0.2 0.5 1 2 5 10 20 We have already seen, in Figures 11.7 and 11.10, Young’s modulus E (GPa) how fiber content, shape, and orientation control composite properties, and in Figure 11.24 how FIGURE 13.16 the foam density and connectivity dramatically The strength and toughness of polypropylene, showing the effect influence the properties of cellular solids. The of fillers, impact modifiers, and fibers. strengths of polymers span around a factor of 5 and their fracture toughnesses a factor of 20, depending on chemistry, chain length, and degree of cross-linking. More dramatic changes are possible by blending, filling, reinforcing, or plasticizing. Figure 13.16 shows how these influence the modulus E and fracture toughness Klc of polypropylene, PP. Blending or copolymerization with elastomers, such as EPR or EDPM (“impact modifiers”), reduces the modulus but increases the fracture toughness Klc and toughness Gc. Filling with inexpensive powdered glass, talc, or calcium carbonate more than doubles the modulus; however, that is at the expense of some loss of toughness. Plasticizing (blending with low-molecularweight polymers) lowers the modulus even more dramatically. Between them, these processes can change the polymer modulus by a factor of 100 and the toughness by a factor of 10.<br>\n <br>\n Of all the properties that materials scientists and engineers have sought to manipulate, the strength of metals and alloys is probably the most explored. It is easy to see why—Table 13.1 lists some of their applications. Solution hardening, precipitation hardening, and work hardening are combined to give desired combinations of strength and toughness. Figure 13.17 illustrates the large gains in strength of copper alloys that these mechanisms allow. Good things, however, have to be paid for. Here the payment required for increased strength is loss of ductility, in this case measured by the elongation to fracture εf. Strength and ductility are structure-sensitive properties—they depend on composition and microstructure, and these, in turn, are controlled by<br>\n <br>\n 389<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n Table 13.1 Metal Alloys with Typical Applications, Indicating the Strengthening Mechanisms Used Solution Hardening<br>\n <br>\n Alloy<br>\n <br>\n Typical Uses<br>\n <br>\n Pure Al<br>\n <br>\n Kitchen foil<br>\n <br>\n Pure Cu<br>\n <br>\n Wire<br>\n <br>\n Cast Al, Mg<br>\n <br>\n Automotive parts Marine components<br>\n <br>\n ✓✓✓ ✓✓✓<br>\n <br>\n Bronze (Cu-Sn), Brass (Cu-Zn) Non-heat-treatable wrought Al<br>\n <br>\n Precipitate Hardening<br>\n <br>\n Work Hardening ✓✓✓ ✓✓✓<br>\n <br>\n ✓ ✓<br>\n <br>\n ✓ ✓✓✓ ✓<br>\n <br>\n Ships, cans, structures<br>\n <br>\n ✓✓✓<br>\n <br>\n Heat-treatable wrought Al Low carbon steels<br>\n <br>\n Aircraft, structures Car bodies, structures, ships, cans<br>\n <br>\n ✓ ✓✓✓<br>\n <br>\n ✓✓✓<br>\n <br>\n Low alloy steels Stainless steels Cast Ni alloys<br>\n <br>\n Automotive parts, tools Pressure vessels Jet engine turbines<br>\n <br>\n ✓ ✓✓✓ ✓✓✓<br>\n <br>\n ✓✓✓ ✓ ✓✓✓<br>\n <br>\n ✓✓✓ ✓ ✓✓✓<br>\n <br>\n Symbols: ✓✓✓ = routinely used; ✓ = sometimes used.<br>\n <br>\n 2000 Yield strength σy, tension (MPa)<br>\n <br>\n 390<br>\n <br>\n Copper-beryllium alloys<br>\n <br>\n 1000 500<br>\n <br>\n 200<br>\n <br>\n Precipitation hardening<br>\n <br>\n Strengthening copper alloys Brass, work hardened Pure copper, work hardened<br>\n <br>\n Work hardening<br>\n <br>\n 100<br>\n <br>\n Brass, soft Solution hardening<br>\n <br>\n 50<br>\n <br>\n Pure, soft copper MFA, 10<br>\n <br>\n 20 1<br>\n <br>\n 10 Elongation ε f (%)<br>\n <br>\n 100<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.17 Strengthening mechanisms and the consequent drop in ductility, here shown for copper alloys.

Hardness, fatigue strength, fracture toughness, and thermal and electrical conductivities, too, are structure-sensitive properties.

Figure 13.20 shows the sequence for a mediumcarbon steel. The steel is solutionized (heated into the FCC austenite field) to dissolve all of the carbon it then quenched in water or oil, which causes it to transform to hard, brittle martensite. Martensite has high hardness but is so brittle—its fracture toughness is so low that it is almost useless as a structural material. Tempering reduces the hardness and yield strength but restores toughness to a degree that depends on the tempering temperature and time. The desired property set is obtained by controlling these.<br>\n <br>\n Thermal conductivity λ (W/m.K)<br>\n <br>\n Hardening of aluminum alloys 400 Commercial heat exchanger alloys<br>\n <br>\n Pure Al<br>\n <br>\n 300 Work hardening<br>\n <br>\n 200 So<br>\n <br>\n Pre<br>\n <br>\n lut ion<br>\n <br>\n cipit ation harden ing<br>\n <br>\n ha rde<br>\n <br>\n nin g<br>\n <br>\n + Work hardening<br>\n <br>\n 100<br>\n <br>\n Aluminum alloys<br>\n <br>\n 50 10<br>\n <br>\n MFA, 10<br>\n <br>\n 30 100 300 Yield strength σy (MPa)<br>\n <br>\n 1000<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.18 Thermal conductivity and strength for aluminum alloys.<br>\n <br>\n Strong conductors<br>\n <br>\n Copperberyllium Conductor materials Hard drawn copper<br>\n <br>\n h ar den ing<br>\n <br>\n 300<br>\n <br>\n 100<br>\n <br>\n Solu<br>\n <br>\n te<br>\n <br>\n Coppernickel, hard drawn<br>\n <br>\n Brasses, bronzes, hard drawn<br>\n <br>\n g enin hard<br>\n <br>\n o en r k ing<br>\n <br>\n 1000<br>\n <br>\n Work hardening Pr ec ipi ta t e<br>\n <br>\n Figure 13.19 illustrates this for one of the best conductors that we have: copper. Adding solute increases its strength, but the solute atoms also act as scattering centers, increasing the electrical resistivity too. Dislocations add strength (by what we called work hardening) and they too scatter electrons a little, though not as much as solute. Precipitates offer the greatest gain in strength with only a slight loss of conductivity.

Figure 13.21 lists the now-familiar steps: translation, screening, ranking, and documentation. Translation As we saw in earlier chapters, the function of a component dictates the initial choice of material and shape. This choice exerts constraints on the choice of processes. It is helpful to think of two types of constraint: technical—can the process do the job at all? And quality—can it do so sufficiently well? One technical constraint is always there: the compatibility of material and process. Quality constraints include achieving the desired precision, surface finish, and property profile while avoiding defects. The usual objective in processing is to minimize cost. The free variables are largely limited to choosing the process itself and its operating parameters (such as temperatures, flow rates, and so on). Table 13.2 summarizes the outcome of the translation stage. Screening The screening step applies the constraints, eliminating processes that cannot meet them. Some process attributes are simple numeric ranges—the size or mass of component the process can handle, the precision, or the surface smoothness it can achieve. Others are nonnumeric—lists of materials to which the process can be applied, for example. Requirements such as “made of magnesium and weighing about 3 kg” are easily compared with the process attributes to eliminate those that cannot shape magnesium or cannot handle a component as large as 3 kg.<br>\n <br>\n 13.5 Systematic Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n Ranking Ranking, as before, is based on one or more objectives, the most obvious of which is that of minimizing cost. In certain demanding applications it may be replaced by the objective of maximizing quality regardless of cost, though more usually it is a trade-off between the two that is sought. Documentation Screening and ranking do not cope adequately with the less tractable issues of quality and productivity; they are best explored through a search for documentation—that is, design guidelines, best practice guides, case studies, and failure analyses. All processes The most important technical expertise relates to productivity and quality. All types of processing equipment Translate design requirements have optimum operating condition identify function, technical, and quality constraints, objectives, and free variables ranges under which they work best and produce products with uncompromised quality. Failure to operate Screen using constraints within this window can lead to manueliminate processes that facturing defects, such as excessive cannot do the job porosity, cracking, or residual stress. This in turn leads to scrap and lost productivity, and, if passed on to the Rank using objective user, may cause premature failure. find the screened processes that do the job most economically Documentation is an essential part of the selection exercise.

Shaping processes are at the top, with compatible combinations marked by colored dots that identify the material family.

The diagonal spread of the dots in the matrix reveals that each material class—metals,<br>\n <br>\n Joining<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Finishing<br>\n <br>\n 394<br>\n <br>\n MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n 13.5 Systematic Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n polymers, and such—has its own set of process routes. There are some overlaps —powder methods are compatible with both metals and ceramics, molding with both polymers and glasses. Machining (when used for shaping) is compatible with almost all families. Joining processes using adhesives and fasteners are very versatile and can be used with most materials, whereas welding methods are material-specific. Finishing processes are used primarily for the harder materials, particularly metals; polymers are molded to shape and rarely treated further except for decorative purposes. We will see why later. Process-shape compatibility Shape is the most difficult attribute to characterize. Many processes involve rotation or translation of a tool or of the material, directing our thinking toward axial symmetry, translational symmetry, uniformity of section, and the like. Turning creates axisymmetric (or circular) shapes; extrusion, drawing, and rolling make prismatic shapes, both circular and noncircular. Sheet-forming processes make flat shapes (stamping) or dished shapes (drawing). Certain processes can make three-dimensional shapes, and among these some can make hollow shapes whereas others cannot. Figure 13.23 illustrates this classification scheme. The prismatic shapes shown on the left, made by rolling, extrusion, or drawing, have a special feature: They can be made in continuous lengths. The other shapes cannot—they are discrete, and the processes that make them are called batch processes. Continuous processes are well suited to long, prismatic products such as railway track or standard stock such as tube, plate, and sheet. Cylindrical rolls produce sheets. Shaped rolls make more complex profiles—rail track is one. Extrusion is a particularly versatile continuous process, since complex prismatic profiles that include internal channels and longitudinal features such as ribs and stiffeners can be manufactured in one step. The process-shape matrix displays the links between the two. If the process cannot make the shape we want, it may be possible to combine it with a secondary process to give a process chain that adds the additional features: Casting followed by machining is an obvious example. But remember: Every additional process step adds cost. Shaping processes: Mass and section thickness There are limits to the size of component that a process can make. Figure 13.24 shows the limits. The color coding for material compatibility has been retained, using more than one color when the process can treat more than one material family. Size can be measured by volume or by mass, but since the range of either one covers many orders of magnitude, whereas densities span only a factor of about 50, it doesn’t make much difference which we use—big things are heavy, whatever they are made of. Most processes span a mass range of about a factor of 1000 or so. Note that this attribute is most discriminating at the extremes; the vast majority of components are in the 0.1 to 10 kg range, for which virtually any process will work.<br>\n <br>\n 395<br>\n <br>\n 396<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.23 The process-shape matrix. Information about material compatibility is included at the extreme left.<br>\n <br>\n Each bar spans the size range of which the process is capable without undue technical difficulty. All can be stretched to smaller or larger extremes but at the penalty of extra cost because the equipment is no longer standard. During screening, therefore, it is important to recognize “near misses”— processes that narrowly failed, but that could, if needed, be reconsidered and used. Figure 13.25 shows a second bar chart: that for the ranges of section thickness of which each shaping process is capable. It is the lower end of the ranges— the minimum section thickness—where the physics of the process imposes limits. The origins of these limits are the subject of the next subsection.<br>\n <br>\n Composite shaping<br>\n <br>\n Polymer shaping<br>\n <br>\n Ceramic shaping<br>\n <br>\n Metal shaping<br>\n <br>\n 13.5 Systematic Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n Sand casting Die casting Investment casting Low-pressure casting Forging Extrusion Sheet forming Powder methods Electro-machining Conventional machining Injection molding Blow molding Compression molding Rotational molding Thermo-forming Polymer casting Resin-transfer molding Filament winding Lay-up methods Vacuum bag<br>\n <br>\n Joining<br>\n <br>\n 10−3<br>\n <br>\n 10−2<br>\n <br>\n 0.1<br>\n <br>\n 1 10 Mass (kg)<br>\n <br>\n 102<br>\n <br>\n 103<br>\n <br>\n 104<br>\n <br>\n Adhesives Welding, metals Welding, polymers Fasteners metal<br>\n <br>\n ceramic<br>\n <br>\n polymer<br>\n <br>\n composite<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.24 The process–mass-range chart. The inclusion of joining allows simple process chains to be explored.<br>\n <br>\n Physical limits to size and section thickness Casting and molding both rely on material flow in the liquid or semiliquid state. Lower limits on section thickness are imposed by the physics of flow. Viscosity and surface tension oppose flow through narrow channels, and heat loss from the large surface area of thin sections cools the flowing material, raising the viscosity before the channel is filled (Figure 13.26). Pure metals solidify at a fixed temperature, with a step increase in viscosity, but for alloys solidification happens over a range of temperature, known as the “mushy zone,” in which the alloy is part liquid, part solid. The width of this zone can vary from a few degrees centigrade to several hundred—so metal flow in castings depends on alloy composition. In general, higher-pressure die casting and molding methods enable thinner sections to be made, but the equipment costs more and the faster, more turbulent flow can entrap more porosity and cause damage to the molds.<br>\n <br>\n MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n 397<br>\n <br>\n Metal shaping<br>\n <br>\n Polymer shaping<br>\n <br>\n Ceramic shaping<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Composite shaping<br>\n <br>\n 398<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n Sand casting Die casting Investment casting Low-pressure casting Forging Extrusion Sheet forming Powder methods Electro-machining Conventional machining Injection molding Blow molding Compression molding Rotational molding Thermo-forming Polymer casting Resin-transfer molding Filament winding Lay-up methods Vacuum bag 0.1<br>\n <br>\n 1 metal<br>\n <br>\n ceramic<br>\n <br>\n 10 polymer<br>\n <br>\n composite<br>\n <br>\n 100<br>\n <br>\n 1000 MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n Section thickness (mm)<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.25 The process–section thickness chart.<br>\n <br>\n Upper limits to size and section in casting and molding are set by problems of shrinkage. The outer layer of a casting or molding cools and solidifies first, giving it a rigid skin.

Loss of heat into the mold increases viscosity and may cause premature solidification.<br>\n <br>\n caused by constrained thermal contraction. Different compositions have different susceptibilities to hot tearing—another example of coupling between material, process, and design detail. Metal shaping by deformation—hot or cold rolling, forging, or extrusion— also involves flow. The thinness that can be forged, rolled, or extruded is limited by plastic flow in much the same way that the thinness in casting is limited by viscosity: The thinner the section, the greater the required roll pressure or forging force. Figure 13.27 illustrates the problem. Friction changes the pressure distribution on the die and under the rolls. When they are well-lubricated, as in (a), the loading is almost uniaxial and the material flows at its yield stress σy. With friction, as in (b), the metal shears at the die interface and the pressure ramps up because the friction resists the lateral spreading, giving a “friction hill.” The area under the pressure distribution is the total forming load, so friction increases the load. The greater the aspect ratio of the section (width/thickness), the higher the maximum pressure needed to cause yielding, as in (c). This illustrates the fundamental limit of friction on section thickness—very thin sections simply stick to the tools and will not yield, even with very large pressures. Friction also limits aspect ratio in powder processing. The externally applied pressure is diminished by die-wall friction (Figure 13.28) with the result<br>\n <br>\n 399<br>\n <br>\n 400<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n p=σy τ =0<br>\n <br>\n τ = 0 Tool Billet Tool (a) pmax = 5 − 10 σ y<br>\n <br>\n pmax = 2 − 3 σ y Friction hill<br>\n <br>\n Friction hill<br>\n <br>\n p=σy τ =k<br>\n <br>\n τ =k<br>\n <br>\n p=σy<br>\n <br>\n Tool Barreling<br>\n <br>\n τ =k<br>\n <br>\n τ =k<br>\n <br>\n Billet<br>\n <br>\n Tool<br>\n <br>\n Tool<br>\n <br>\n (b)<br>\n <br>\n Tool<br>\n <br>\n (c)<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.27 The influence of friction and aspect ratio on forging: (a) uniaxial compression with very low friction; (b) with sticking friction the contact pressure rises in a friction hill; (c) the greater the aspect ratio, the greater the pressure rise, ultimately limiting the thinness that can be achieved.<br>\n <br>\n Limiting aspect ratio for powder pressing How large is the pressure drop in a cylindrical powder mass like that in Figure 13.28 caused by die-wall friction if the coefficient of friction on the die wall is μ = 0.5?<br>\n <br>\n Answer The frictional force opposing sliding in the green band of thickness dx is 2π r μ p dx where p is the pressure at a distance x below the die face.

Tolerance and roughness The precision and surface finish of a component are aspects of its quality. They are measured by the tolerance and the surface roughness R. When the dimensions of a component are specified the surface quality is specified as well, though not necessarily over the entire surface. Surface quality is critical in contacting surfaces such as the faces of flanges that must mate to form a seal or sliders running in grooves. It is also important for resistance to fatigue crack initiation and for aesthetic reasons. The tolerance T on a dimension y is specified as y = 100 ± 0:1 mm, or as y = 50+0:01 −0:001 mm, indicating that there is more freedom to oversize than to undersize. Surface roughness is specified as an upper limit, for example, R &lt; 100 μm. The typical surface finish required in various products is shown in Table 13.3. The table also indicates typical processes that can achieve these levels of finish. Surface roughness is a measure of the irregularities of the surface (Figure 13.29). It is defined as the root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude of the surface profile: R2 =<br>\n <br>\n L<br>\n <br>\n 1∫ 2 y ðxÞdx L0<br>\n <br>\n (13.1)<br>\n <br>\n One way to measure it is to drag a light, sharp stylus over the surface in the x-direction while recording the vertical profile y(x), like playing a gramophone record.

The tolerance T is obviously greater than 2R; indeed, since R is the root-mean-square roughness, the peak roughness, and hence the absolute lower limit for tolerance, is more like 5R. Real processes give tolerances that range from 10R to 1000R.<br>\n <br>\n Figures 13.30 and 13.31 show the characteristic ranges of tolerance and roughness of which processes are capable, retaining the color coding for material families. Data for finishing processes are added below the shaping processes. Sand casting gives rough surfaces; casting into metal dies gives smoother ones. No shaping processes for metals, however, do better than T = 0.1 mm and R = 0.5 μm. Machining, capable of high dimensional accuracy and surface finish, is commonly used after casting or deformation processing to bring the tolerance or finish up to the desired level, creating a process chain. Metals and ceramics can be surface-ground and lapped to a high precision and smoothness: A large telescope reflector has a tolerance approaching 5 μm and a roughness of about 1/100 of this over a dimension of a meter or more. But precision and finish carry a cost: Processing costs increase exponentially as the requirements for both are made more severe. It is an expensive mistake to overspecify precision and finish.<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.29 A section through a surface showing its irregular surface (artistically exaggerated in the vertical direction). The irregularity is measured by the RMS roughness R.<br>\n <br>\n Molded polymers inherit the finish of the molds used to shape them and thus can be very smooth; machining to improve the finish is rarely necessary. Tolerances better than ± 0.2 mm are seldom possible because internal stresses left by molding cause distortion and because polymers creep in service. Joining: Material compatibility Processes for joining metals, polymers, ceramics, and glasses differ. A given adhesive will bond to some materials but not to others; welding methods for polymers differ from those for welding metals; and ceramics, which cannot be welded, are joined instead by diffusion bonding or glaze bonding. The process-material matrix (Figure 13.22) included four classes of joining process.<br>\n <br>\n Metal shaping<br>\n <br>\n Sand casting Die casting Investment casting Low-pressure casting Forging Extrusion Sheet forming Powder methods Electro-machining Conventional machining Injection molding Blow molding Compression molding Rotational molding Thermo-forming Polymer casting Resin-transfer molding Filament winding Lay-up methods Vacuum bag<br>\n <br>\n Composite shaping<br>\n <br>\n Polymer shaping<br>\n <br>\n Ceramic shaping<br>\n <br>\n 13.5 Systematic Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n Finishing<br>\n <br>\n 0.01<br>\n <br>\n 0.1 Tolerance (mm)<br>\n <br>\n 1<br>\n <br>\n 10<br>\n <br>\n Precision machining Grinding Lapping Polishing metal<br>\n <br>\n ceramic<br>\n <br>\n polymer<br>\n <br>\n composite<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.30 The process-tolerance chart. The inclusion of finishing processes allows simple process chains to be explored.<br>\n <br>\n When the joint is between dissimilar materials, the process must be compatible with both. Adhesives and fasteners allow joints between different materials; many welding processes do not. If dissimilar metals are joined in such a way that they are in electrical contact, a corrosion couple appears if the joint is wet. This can be avoided by inserting an insulating layer between the surfaces. Thermal-expansion mismatch gives internal stresses in the joint if the temperature changes, with risk of distortion or damage. Identifying good practice in joining dissimilar materials is part of the documentation step. Joint geometry and mode of loading The geometry of the joint and the way it is loaded (Figure 13.32) influence process choice. Adhesive joints support shear but are poor in peeling—think of stripping off adhesive tape. Adhesives need a large working area—lap joints work well, butt joints do not. Rivets and staples, too, are well adapted for shear loading of lap joints but are less good in tension. Welds and threaded fasteners are more adaptable, but here, too, matching choice of process to geometry and loading is important.<br>\n <br>\n MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n 403<br>\n <br>\n Metal shaping<br>\n <br>\n Polymer shaping<br>\n <br>\n Ceramic shaping<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Composite shaping<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n Sand casting Die casting Investment casting Low-pressure casting Forging Extrusion Sheet forming Powder methods Electro-machining Conventional machining Injection molding Blow molding Compression molding Rotational molding Thermo-forming Polymer casting Resin-transfer molding Filament winding Lay-up methods Vacuum bag 0.01<br>\n <br>\n Finishing<br>\n <br>\n 404<br>\n <br>\n 0.1<br>\n <br>\n 1 Roughness (μm)<br>\n <br>\n 10<br>\n <br>\n 100<br>\n <br>\n Precision machining Grinding Lapping Polishing metal<br>\n <br>\n ceramic<br>\n <br>\n polymer<br>\n <br>\n composite<br>\n <br>\n MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.31 The process–surface roughness chart.

It may be required to conduct or insulate against the conduction of heat or electricity, or to operate at an elevated operating temperature. It may be permanent or have to be disassembled at the end of product life for recycling and reuse: Threaded fasteners and adhesives, loosened with solvents or heat, permit this. Surface treatment: Material compatibility Material process compatibility for surface treatments is shown at the bottom of the matrix in Figure 13.22. As noted previously, surface finishing is more important for metals than for polymers. The purpose of the surface treatment All surface treatment adds cost but the added value can be large. Table 13.4 illustrates the diversity of functions that surface treatments can provide. Some protect, some enhance performance, still others are primarily aesthetic. Protecting a component surface extends product life and increases the interval between maintenance cycles. Coatings on cutting tools enable faster cutting speeds and greater productivity. And surfacehardening processes may enable the substrate alloy to be replaced with a cheaper material—for example, a plain carbon steel with a hard carburized surface or a coating of hard titanium nitride (TiN) instead of a more expensive alloy steel. Secondary compatibilities Some surface treatments, such as anodizing, leave the dimensions, precision, and roughness of the surface unchanged. Electro- and vapor-deposited coatings change the dimensions a little, but may still leave a perfectly smooth surface. Polymer powder coating builds up a relatively thick, smooth layer; others, such as weld deposition, create a thick layer with a rough surface, requiring refinishing. “Line-of-sight” deposition processes coat only the surface at which they are directed, leaving inaccessible areas uncoated; others, with what is called “throwing power,” coat flat, curved, and reentrant surfaces equally well. Many surface treatment processes require heat. These can only be used on materials that can tolerate the rise in temperature. Some paints are applied cold, but many require a bake at up to 150°C. Heat treatments like carburizing or nitriding to give a hard surface layer require prolonged heating at temperatures up to 800°C, which can change the microstructure of the material being coated.

The rest is the cost of manufacture—that is, forming it to a shape and joining and finishing it. Before turning to details, there are four common-sense rules for minimizing cost that the designer should bear in mind, as follows. Keep things standard If someone already makes the part you want, it will almost certainly be cheaper to buy it than to make it. If nobody does, then it is cheaper to design it to be made from standard stock (sheet, rod, tube) than from nonstandard shapes or from special castings or forgings. Try to use standard materials, and as few of them as possible: This will reduce inventory costs and the range of tooling the manufacturer needs, and it can help with recycling. Keep things simple If a part has to be machined, it will have to be clamped; the cost increases with the number of times it will have to be rejigged or reoriented, especially if special tools are necessary. If a part is to be welded or brazed, the welder must be able to reach it with his torch and still see what he is doing. If it is to be cast or molded or forged, it should be remembered that high (and expensive) pressures are required to make fluids flow into narrow channels, and that reentrant shapes greatly complicate mold and die design. Think of making the part yourself: Will it be awkward? Could slight redesign make it less awkward? Make the parts easy to assemble Assembly takes time, and time is money. If the overhead rate is a mere $60 per hour, every minute of assembly time adds another $1 to the cost. Design for assembly (DFA) addresses this problem with a set of common-sense criteria and rules. Briefly, there are three: 1. Minimize part count. 2. Design parts to be self-aligning on assembly. 3. Use joining methods that are fast; snap fits and spot welds are faster than threaded fasteners or, usually, adhesives. Do not specify more performance than is needed Performance must be paid for. High-strength metals are more heavily alloyed with expensive additions; high-performance polymers are chemically more complex; highperformance ceramics require greater quality control in their manufacture. All of these increase material costs. In addition, high-strength materials are hard to fabricate. The forming pressures (whether for a metal or a polymer) are higher; tool wear is greater; ductility is usually less so that deformation processing can be difficult or impossible. This can mean that new processing routes must be used: investment casting or powder forming instead of conventional casting and mechanical working; more expensive molding equipment operating at higher temperatures and pressures; and so on. The better performance of the high-strength material must be paid for, not only in greater material cost but also in the higher cost of processing. Finally, there<br>\n <br>\n 13.6 Ranking: Process Cost<br>\n <br>\n are the questions of tolerance and roughness. Cost rises exponentially with demands for precision and surface finish. The message is clear. Performance costs money. Do not overspecify it. To make further progress, we must examine the contributions to process costs, and their origins. Economic criteria for selection If you have to sharpen a pencil, you can do it with a knife. If, instead, you had to sharpen a thousand pencils, it would pay to buy an electric sharpener. And if you had to sharpen a million, you might wish to equip yourself with an automatic feeding, gripping, and sharpening system. To cope with pencils of different length and diameter, you could go further and devise a microprocessor-controlled system with sensors to measure pencil dimensions, sharpening pressure, and so on —an “intelligent” system that can recognize and adapt to pencil size. The choice of process, then, depends on the number of pencils you wish to sharpen, that is, on the batch size. The best choice is the one that costs the least per pencil sharpened. Figure 13.33 is a schematic of how the cost of sharpening a pencil might vary with batch size. A knife does not cost much but it is slow, so the labor<br>\n <br>\n Relative cost per pencil<br>\n <br>\n 104<br>\n <br>\n Prototype<br>\n <br>\n Small batch<br>\n <br>\n Mass production<br>\n <br>\n Large batch<br>\n <br>\n 102<br>\n <br>\n Knife 1 Electric Automatic Intelligent 0.1 1<br>\n <br>\n MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n 102 Knife cheapest<br>\n <br>\n 104 Number of pencils Electric cheapest<br>\n <br>\n Automatic cheapest<br>\n <br>\n 106<br>\n <br>\n 108 Intelligent cheapest<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.33 The cost of sharpening a pencil plotted against batch size for four processes.

The other processes involve progressively greater capital investment but do the job more quickly, reducing labor costs. The balance between capital cost and rate gives the shape of the curves. In this figure the best choice is the lowest curve—a knife for up to 100 pencils; an electric sharpener for 102 to 104, an automatic system for 104 to 106, and so on. Each process has an economic batch size.<br>\n <br>\n Metal shaping<br>\n <br>\n Ceramic shaping<br>\n <br>\n Economic batch size Process cost depends on a large number of independent variables, not all within the control of the modeler. Cost modeling is described in the next section, but—given the disheartening implications of the last sentence—it is comforting to have an alternative, if approximate, way out. The economic batch size provides it. Values for the processes described in this chapter are shown in Figure 13.34. A process with an economic batch size with the range B 1 –B 2 is one that is found by experience to be competitive in cost when the output lies in that range, just as the electric sharpener was economic in the range 10 2 to 10 4. The economic batch size is commonly cited for processes. The easy way to introduce economy into the selection is to rank candidate processes by economic batch size and retain those that are economic in the range you want. But do not harbor false illusions: Many variables cannot be rolled into one without loss of discrimination. A cost model gives deeper insight.<br>\n <br>\n Polymer shaping<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Composite shaping<br>\n <br>\n 408<br>\n <br>\n Sand casting Die casting Investment casting Low-pressure casting Forging Extrusion Sheet forming Powder methods Electro-machining Conventional machining Injection molding Blow molding Compression molding Rotational molding Thermo-forming Polymer casting Resin-transfer molding Filament winding Lay-up methods Vacuum bag 1<br>\n <br>\n 10 metal<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 13.34 The economic batch size chart.<br>\n <br>\n 102 103 104 105 Economic batch size (units) ceramic<br>\n <br>\n polymer<br>\n <br>\n composite<br>\n <br>\n 106<br>\n <br>\n 107 MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n 13.6 Ranking: Process Cost<br>\n <br>\n Cost modeling The manufacture of a component consumes resources (Figure 13.35), each of which has an associated cost. The final cost is the sum of expenses of all of the resources it consumes (detailed in Table 13.5). Thus the cost of producing a component of mass m entails the cost Cm ($/kg) of the materials and feedstocks from which it is made. It involves the cost of dedicated tooling Ct ($) and that of the capital equipment Cc ($) in which the tooling will be used. It requires time, chargeable at an overhead rate C_ oh (thus with units of $/hr), in which we include the cost of labor, administration, and general plant costs. It requires energy, which is sometimes charged against a process step if it is very energy intense but more commonly is treated as part of the overhead and lumped into C ̇ oh , as we shall do here. Finally there is the cost of information, meaning research and development, royalty or license fees; this, too, we view as a cost per unit time and lump it into the overhead. Think now of the manufacture of a component (the “unit of output”) weighing m kg, made of a material costing C m $/kg. The first contribution to the unit cost is that of the material mCm magnified by the factor 1/(1−f ) where f is the scrap fraction—the fraction of the starting material that ends up as sprues, risers, turnings, rejects, or waste: C1 =<br>\n <br>\n mCm ð1−f Þ<br>\n <br>\n (13.2)<br>\n <br>\n The cost Ct of a set of tooling—dies, molds, fixtures, and jigs—is what is called a dedicated cost: one that must be wholly assigned to the production run of this single component.

Tooling wears out. If the run is a long one, replacement will be necessary. Thus tooling cost per unit takes the form   Ct n C2 = Int + 0:51 (13.3) n nt where nt is the number of units that a set of tooling can make before it has to be replaced, and Int is the integer function. The term in curly brackets simply increments the tooling cost by that of one tool set every time n exceeds nt. The capital cost of equipment Cc, by contrast, is rarely dedicated. A given piece of equipment—a powder press, for example—can be used to make many different components by installing different die-sets or tooling. It is usual to convert the capital cost of nondedicated equipment, and the cost of borrowing the capital itself, into an overhead by dividing it by a capital write-off time two (five years, say) over which it is to be recovered. The quantity Cc/two is then a cost per hour—provided the equipment is used continuously. That is rarely the case, so the term is modified by dividing it by a load factor L—the fraction of time for which the equipment is productive. The cost per unit is then this hourly cost divided by the rate n ̇ at which units are produced:   1 Cc C3 = n_ Ltwo<br>\n <br>\n (13.4)<br>\n <br>\n Finally there is the overhead rate C_ oh . It becomes a cost per unit when divided by the production rate n ̇ units per hour (averaged over the production run to allow for downtime): C4 =<br>\n <br>\n C_ oh n_<br>\n <br>\n (13.5)<br>\n <br>\n The total shaping cost per part is the sum of these four terms, taking the form     mCm Ct Cc n 1 _ C= + Int + 0:51 + + C oh n_ Ltwo ð1−f Þ n nt<br>\n <br>\n (13.6)<br>\n <br>\n The equation says: The cost has three essential contributions—a material cost per unit of production that is independent of batch size and rate, a dedicated cost per unit of production that varies as the reciprocal of the production volume (1/n), and a gross overhead per unit of production that varies as the reciprocal of the production rate ð1/n_ Þ. The equation describes a set of curves relating cost C to batch size n, one for each process. Each has the shape of the pencil-sharpening curves of Figure 13.33. The use of the model is illustrated more fully in the case studies of Chapter 14.<br>\n <br>\n 13.7 Computer-Aided Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n Technical cost modeling Equation (13.6) is the first step in modeling cost. Greater predictive power is possible with technical cost models that exploit understanding of the way in which the design, the process, and cost interact. The capital cost of equipment depends on size and degree of automation. Tooling cost and production rate depend on complexity. These and many other dependencies can be captured in theoretical or empirical formulae or look-up tables that can be built into the cost model, giving more resolution in ranking competing processes. For more advanced analyses the reader is referred to the literature listed in “Further reading,” at the end of this chapter.<br>\n <br>\n 13.7 COMPUTER-AIDED PROCESS SELECTION Screening If process attributes are stored in a database with an appropriate user interface, selection charts can be created and selection boxes manipulated with much greater freedom. The CES platform, mentioned earlier, is an example of such a system. The database contains records, each describing the attributes of a single process. Example 13.1 shows part of a typical record: that for injection molding. A schematic indicates how the process works; it is supported by a short description. This is followed by a list of attributes: the shapes it can make, the attributes relating to shape and physical characteristics, and those that describe economic parameters; ending with brief documentation in the form of guidelines, technical notes, and typical uses. The numeric attributes are stored as ranges, indicating the range of capability of the process. Each record is linked to records for the materials with which it is compatible, allowing choice of material to be used as a screening criterion, like the material compatibility matrix of Figure 13.22 but with greater resolution. A short list of candidates is extracted in two steps: screening to eliminate processes that cannot meet the design specification, and ranking to order the survivors by economic criteria.<br>\n <br>\n EXAMPLE 13.1 Injection Molding The Process The most widely used process for shaping thermoplastics is the reciprocating screw injection molding machine, shown in the diagram on the right. Polymer granules are fed into a spiral press where they are heated, mixed, and softened to a dough-like consistency that is forced through one or more channels (“sprues”) into the die. The polymer solidifies under pressure and the component is then ejected.<br>\n <br>\n Mold<br>\n <br>\n Granular Polymer Nozzle Cylinder<br>\n <br>\n Heater<br>\n <br>\n Screw<br>\n <br>\n 411<br>\n <br>\n 412<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 13:<br>\n <br>\n Processes and Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n Thermoplastics, thermosets, and elastomers can also be injection molded.

The surface finish is good; texture and pattern can be easily altered in the tool; and fine detail reproduces well. Decorative labels can be molded onto the surface of the component. The only finishing operation is the removal of the sprue. Technical Notes Most thermoplastics can be injection molded, although those with high melting temperatures (e.g., PTFE) are difficult. Thermoplastic-based composites (short-fiber and particulate filled) can be processed providing the filler-loading is not too large. Large changes in section area are not recommended. Small reentrant angles and complex shapes are possible, though some features (e.g., undercuts, screw threads, inserts) may result in increased tooling costs. Typical Uses Housings, containers, covers, knobs, tool handles, plumbing fittings, lenses, toys, and so on.<br>\n <br>\n To enable this, the cost model described in Section 13.6 is implemented in the CES software. The records contain approximate data for the ranges of capital and tooling costs (C c and Ct) and for the rate of production (n_ ). Equation (13.6) contains other parameters not listed in the record because they are not attributes of the process itself but depend on the design, or the material, or the economics (and thus the location) of the plant in which the processing will be done. The user must provide this information, conveniently<br>\n <br>\n 13.9 Further Reading<br>\n <br>\n entered through a dialog box. The output is a plot of cost against batch size, like that shown earlier in Figure 13.33. More information about computer-aided selection can be found in the sources listed under Granta Design (2010) in “Further reading.”<br>\n <br>\n 13.8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS A wide range of shaping, joining, and finishing processes is available to the design engineer. Each has certain characteristics, which, taken together, suit it to the processing of certain materials in certain shapes, but disqualify it for others. Faced with the choice, the designer in the past, relied on locally available expertise or on common practice. Neither of these leads to innovation, nor are they well matched to current design methods. The structured, systematic approach of this chapter provides a way forward. It ensures that potentially interesting processes are not overlooked, and guides the user quickly to processes capable of achieving the desired requirements. The method parallels that for selection of material, using process selection matrices and charts to implement the procedure. A component design dictates a certain, known combination of process attributes. These design requirements are plotted onto the charts, identifying a subset of possible processes. The method lends itself to computer implementation, allowing selection from a large portfolio of processes by screening on attributes and ranking by economic criteria. There is, of course, much more to process selection than this. It is to be seen, rather, as a first systematic step, replacing a total reliance on local experience and past practice. The narrowing of choice helps considerably: It is now much easier to identify the right source for more expert knowledge and to ask it the right questions. But the final choice still depends on local economic and organizational factors that can only be decided on a case-by-case basis.<br>\n <br>\n 13.9 FURTHER READING ASM Handbook Series (1971–2004).

The inputs are design requirements; the output is a shortlist of processes capable of meeting them. Where processes compete, a ranking is made possible by a cost model. The case studies in this chapter illustrate the method. The first four make use of hard-copy charts; the last two show how computer-based selection works. The case studies follow a standard pattern. First, we list the design requirements: material, shape, size, minimum section, precision, and finish. Then we plot these requirements onto the process matrices, identifying search areas. The processes that lie within the search areas are capable of making the component to its design specification: They are the candidates. If no one process meets all the design requirements, then processes have to be “stacked”: casting followed by machining (to meet the tolerance specification on one surface, for instance); or powder methods followed by grinding. More details for the most promising are then sought, starting with the data sources listed under “Further reading” and in the more comprehensive compilation of Appendix D. The final choice evolves from this subset, taking into account local factors, often specific to a particular company, geographical area, or country.<br>\n <br>\n 14.2 CASTING AN ALUMINUM CON-ROD Connecting rods link oscillatory motion to rotary motion in IC engines, and rotary to oscillatory motion in pumps. Here we explore competing processes for casting a small aluminum alloy connecting rod (Figure 14.1), using the cost model of Chapter 13 to distinguish between them. The design requirements The con-rod is a solid 3D shape to be made of a nonferrous alloy. The dimensions of the con-rod are such that its mass is about 0.3 kg and its minimum section 8 mm. The precision and tolerance of the casting are not critical since the bores and their faces will have to be machined to give the required precision. A batch size of 100,000 is envisaged. Table 14.1 summarizes the requirements.<br>\n <br>\n ∅14 ± 0.02<br>\n <br>\n 28 ± 0.25 8 ± 0.25<br>\n <br>\n ∅18 ± 0.02<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 14.1 A connecting rod. The precision of the bores and bore facings is much higher than that of the rest of the body, requiring subsequent machining.<br>\n <br>\n 14.2 Casting an Aluminum Con-Rod<br>\n <br>\n Table 14.1 Requirements for the Con-rod Function Constraints<br>\n <br>\n Objective Free variables<br>\n <br>\n Connecting rod Material: aluminum casting alloy Shape: solid, 3D Estimated mass: 0.3–0.4 kg Minimum section: 8 mm Tolerance: &lt; 1.0 mm (surfaces), &lt; 0.02 mm (bores) Roughness: not critical Batch size: 100,000 Minimize cost Choice of process Process-operating conditions<br>\n <br>\n 9 &gt; = &gt; ; <br>\n <br>\n – Technical constraints – Quality constraints – Economic constraint<br>\n <br>\n Table 14.2 Shortlist for Shaping the Con-rod Process<br>\n <br>\n Comment<br>\n <br>\n Sand casting plus machining Low-pressure casting Die casting<br>\n <br>\n The process–tolerance chart, Figure 14.8, reveals that none of these can meet the requirement on bore tolerance. All will require a subsequent machining operation.<br>\n <br>\n The selection The constraints are plotted on the process matrices and charts in Figures 14.4 through 14.10 in the chapter. The material, the shape, and the required batch size eliminate most of the processes listed on them, leaving three casting processes and machining from solid as options. Machining is rejected on the grounds of material wastage; retained are sand casting, die casting, and low-pressure casting (Table 14.2). More insight is given by examining their relative cost, using the model of Equation (13.6). The relevant data are assembled in Table 14.3, in which all costs all are normalized by the material cost, the term mC m /(1 − f ). The results are plotted in Figure 14.2 as unit cost C versus batch size n curves, following the example in Figure 13.33. At small batch sizes the unit cost is dominated by the “fixed” costs of tooling (the second term on the right of Equation (13.6)). As the batch size n increases, this contribution falls (provided, of course, that the tooling has a life that is greater than n) until it flattens out at a value that is dominated by the “variable” costs of material, labor, and other overheads.  ̇ Competing processes usually differ in tooling cost Ct and production rate n, causing their C – n curves to intersect, as they do here. Sand-casting equipment is inexpensive but the process is slow. The cost of molds for low-pressure casting is greater than for sand casting, and the process is a little faster. Die-casting equipment costs much more but it is also much<br>\n <br>\n 417<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 14:<br>\n <br>\n Case Studies: Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n Table 14.3 Data for the Cost Equation for the Processes in Table 14.2 Relative Cost*<br>\n <br>\n Sand Casting<br>\n <br>\n Die Casting<br>\n <br>\n Low-pressure Casting<br>\n <br>\n Material, mCm/(1 − f ) Basic overhead C ̇ oh (hr−1) Capital write-off time two (yrs) Load factor<br>\n <br>\n 1 10<br>\n <br>\n 1 10<br>\n <br>\n 1 10<br>\n <br>\n 5 0.5<br>\n <br>\n 5 0.5<br>\n <br>\n 5 0.5<br>\n <br>\n Dedicated tool cost, Ct Capital cost, Cc Batch rate, n ̇ (hr−1)<br>\n <br>\n 210 1800 3<br>\n <br>\n 16,000 30,000 50<br>\n <br>\n 2,000 8,000 10<br>\n <br>\n Tool life, nt (number of units)<br>\n <br>\n 200,000<br>\n <br>\n 1,000,000<br>\n <br>\n 500,000<br>\n <br>\n Comment<br>\n <br>\n Process-independent parameters<br>\n <br>\n Process-dependent parameters<br>\n <br>\n * All costs normalized to the material cost.<br>\n <br>\n 104<br>\n <br>\n Casting processes<br>\n <br>\n Tooling costs dominate<br>\n <br>\n Relative cost per component<br>\n <br>\n 418<br>\n <br>\n 103<br>\n <br>\n Die casting Low-pressure casting<br>\n <br>\n 102<br>\n <br>\n 10<br>\n <br>\n Material and time costs dominate<br>\n <br>\n Sand casting<br>\n <br>\n 1 Material cost 0.1<br>\n <br>\n mCm (1− f )<br>\n <br>\n MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n 1<br>\n <br>\n 10<br>\n <br>\n Sand casting cheapest<br>\n <br>\n 102 103 104 Number of components<br>\n <br>\n Low-pressure casting cheapest<br>\n <br>\n 105<br>\n <br>\n 106<br>\n <br>\n Die casting cheapest<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 14.2 The relative cost of casting the con-rod as a function of the production run. The costs are normalized by the cost of the material.<br>\n <br>\n 14.3 Forming a Fan<br>\n <br>\n faster. The material cost, the labor cost per hour, and the capital write-off time are taken to be the same for all. The curves for sand, low-pressure, and die casting intersect at a batch size of 200: Below this, sand casting is the more economical. Low-pressure casting becomes marginally less expensive than the others for batches of between 200 and 8000, above which die casting becomes the most economic choice. The best choice for a batch size of 100,000 is die casting. Note that, for small batches, the component cost is dominated by that of the tooling—the material cost hardly matters. But as the batch size grows, the contribution of the second term in the cost equation diminishes; and if the process is fast, the unit cost falls until it is typically about three times that of the material of which the component is made. Postscript There are other issues of quality besides precision and smoothness that enter into the choice of process. Sand castings tend to trap bubbles and inclusions that act as starting points for fatigue cracks in a cyclically loaded component like a con-rod. Some low-pressure–casting techniques smooth the flow of liquid metal into the die, reducing defect content. Die casting uses higher pressures, and generally gives the highest-quality casting. Considerations such as these can shift the economic switch-points, expanding the economic batch range of the process that offers the highest quality.<br>\n <br>\n 14.3 FORMING A FAN Fans for vacuum cleaners (Figure 14.3) are designed to be cheap, quiet, and efficient, probably in that order. The key to minimizing process costs is to form the fan to its final shape in a single operation, leaving only the central hub to be machined to fit the shaft with which it mates. This means the selection of a single process that can meet the specifications for precision and tolerance, avoiding the need for machining or finishing of the disk or blades. The design requirements Nylon is the material of choice for the fan. The pumping rate of a fan is determined by its rate of revolution and its size. The designer calculates the need for a fan of radius 60 mm, with 12 profiled blades of average thickness 4 mm. The volume of material in the fan is, roughly, its surface area times its thickness—about 10−4 m3—giving (when multiplied by the density of nylon, 1100 kg/m3) a weight in the range 0.1 to 0.15 kg. The fan has a fairly complex shape, although its high symmetry simplifies it somewhat. We classify it as 3D solid. In the designer’s view, balance and surface smoothness are what really matter. They (and the geometry) determine the pumping efficiency of the fan and influence the noise it makes. The designer specifies a tolerance of ± 0.5 mm and a surface roughness of ≤ 1 μm. A production run of 10,000 fans is planned.<br>\n <br>\n 419<br>\n <br>\n 420<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 14:<br>\n <br>\n Case Studies: Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n Surface roughness critical<br>\n <br>\n 60 mm<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 14.3 A fan.

What processes can meet them? The selection We turn first to the material-process and shape-process matrices (Figures 14.4 and 14.5) on which selection boxes have been drawn. The intersection of the two leaves five classes of shaping process—those boxed in the second figure. Screening on mass and section thickness (Figures 14.6 and 14.7) eliminates polymer casting and RTM, leaving the other three. The constraints on tolerance and roughness are upper limits only (Figures 14.8 and 14.9); all three process classes survive. The planned batch size of 10,000 plotted on the economic batch-size chart (Figure 14.10) eliminates machining from solid. The surviving processes are listed in Table 14.5.<br>\n <br>\n Shaping<br>\n <br>\n Sand casting Die casting Investment casting Low-pressure casting Forging Extrusion Sheet forming Powder methods Electro-machining Conventional machining Injection molding Blow molding Compression molding Rotational molding Thermo-forming Polymer casting Resin-transfer molding Filament winding Lay-up methods Vacuum bag<br>\n <br>\n Joining<br>\n <br>\n Adhesives Welding, metals Welding, polymers Fasteners<br>\n <br>\n Finishing<br>\n <br>\n Precision machining Grinding Lapping Polishing Conrod<br>\n <br>\n os ites<br>\n <br>\n foa ms<br>\n <br>\n Co mp<br>\n <br>\n er Po lym<br>\n <br>\n rm os ets<br>\n <br>\n Th e<br>\n <br>\n rm op las tics Th e<br>\n <br>\n ers sto m Ela<br>\n <br>\n Gla sse s<br>\n <br>\n ram ics<br>\n <br>\n on fer rou s<br>\n <br>\n Ce<br>\n <br>\n tals ,n<br>\n <br>\n Me<br>\n <br>\n Me ta<br>\n <br>\n ls,<br>\n <br>\n fer rou s<br>\n <br>\n 14.3 Forming a Fan<br>\n <br>\n Conrod<br>\n <br>\n Insulator Fan<br>\n <br>\n metal<br>\n <br>\n ceramic<br>\n <br>\n polymer<br>\n <br>\n foam<br>\n <br>\n composite<br>\n <br>\n MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 14.4 The process–material compatibility matrix, showing the requirements of the case studies.

Figure 14.11 shows the resulting cost curves. The tooling for compression molding is less expensive than that for injection molding, but it is slower because, by using multiple die cavities, injection 1<br>\n <br>\n Data from the records in the CES software for these processes.<br>\n <br>\n 14.4 Spark Plug Insulators<br>\n <br>\n molding can produce several units in one shot. This makes the two curves intersect at about 10,000 units: Below, compression molding is the less expensive; above, it is injection molding. Postscript There are (as always) other considerations—the questions of capital investment, local skills, overhead rate, and so forth. The charts cannot answer these. But the procedure has been helpful in narrowing the choice, suggesting alternatives, and providing a background against which a final selection can be made. Related case studies 6.6 “Materials for flywheels” 14.2 “Casting an aluminum con-rod”<br>\n <br>\n 14.4 SPARK PLUG INSULATORS The difficulties of using hard-copy charts for process selection will, by now, be obvious: The charts have limited resolution and are clumsy to use. They give a helpful overview but they are not the way to get a definitive selection. Computer-based methods overcome both problems. The CES system, which builds on the methods in Chapter 5, was described earlier. It allows limits to be set on material, shape, mass, section, tolerance, and surface roughness, delivering the subset of processes that meet all the limits. The economics are then examined by plotting the desired batch size on a bar chart of economic batch size, or by implementing the cost model that is built into the software. If the requirements are very demanding, no single process can meet them all. Then the procedure is to relax the most demanding of them (often tolerance and surface roughness), seeking processes that can meet the others. A second process is then sought to add the desired refinement. The next two case studies show how the method works. The design requirements The anatomy of a spark plug is sketched in Figure 14.12. It is an assembly of components, one of which is the insulator. This is to be made of a ceramic, alumina, with the shape shown in the figure: an axisymmetric, hollow, stepped shape. It weighs about 0.05 kg and has a minimum section of 1.2 mm. Precision is important, since the insulator is part of an assembly; the design specifies a precision of ± 0.3 mm and a surface finish of better than 10 μm. The insulators are to be made in large numbers: The projected batch size is 100,000. Cost should be as low as possible. Table 14.7 summarizes the requirements.<br>\n <br>\n 429<br>\n <br>\n 430<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 14:<br>\n <br>\n Case Studies: Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 14.12 A spark plug.

Only one process family survives: powder methods. The required batch size of 100,000 lies within its economic range (refer to Figure 14.6). The family of powder methods is a large one, including die pressing and sintering, hot pressing, powder extrusion, powder injection molding, hot isostatic pressing, and spray deposition. These (and others) could be added to the charts, but to do so makes them cumbersome. It is better to manage the information in a computer-based environment. The CES system does this. Applying the constraints listed in Table 14.7 eliminates all but two of the processes in its database: die pressing and sintering and powder injection molding (PIM: the shaping of a powder by mixing it with a polymer binder, molding, then burning off the binder during the subsequent sintering).

The user-defined inputs are listed at the top right. The unit cost, high at low batch sizes, falls to about twice that of the material at batch sizes above about 10,000. Postscript Insulators are made commercially by PIM. Economics, for a mass-produced product like this, are critical—pennies count. Technical cost modeling, described before in Chapter 13, can guide the choice of the best equipment and optimum operating conditions to minimize cost.

The minimum section thickness is between 2 and 5 mm. The requirements for precision and surface finish are severe (tolerance &lt; ± 0.1 mm, roughness &lt; 20 μm). Because of its limited application, only 20 units are to be made. Table 14.8 lists the requirements. The charts cannot give much guidance in selecting processes to make such a complex component. We turn instead to computer-aided selection. The selection The constraints are applied by entering them in a limit-selection dialog box like that in Figure 5.12 (left). The material constraint (nickel) and the shape constraint (3D hollow) eliminate a large number of processes. Figure 14.15 shows 15 that survive. The subsequent constraints on mass and section thickness eliminate more, leaving only the six that remain in color in the figure. Applying the severe constraints on tolerance and surface roughness eliminates all but one: electroforming. The required batch size lies within its range. Postscript A search for further information in the sources listed in Appendix D reveals that electroforming of nickel is an established practice and that components as large as 20 kg are routinely made by this process.

The task is to choose a joining process for the seams between the sheets. The design requirements The process must be compatible with the material, here low carbon steel sheet of thickness 1.5 mm. The lap joints carry only low loads in service but handling during installation may impose tension and shear. They must conduct heat, be watertight, and able to tolerate temperatures up to 100°C. There is no need for the joints to be disassembled for recycling at the end of life since the whole thing is steel. Table 14.9 summarizes the translation. The selection The CES system has records and attributes for 52 joining processes. Applying the material constraint leaves 32 of them—those eliminated are polymer specific or composite specific. Further screening on joint geometry, mode of loading, and section thickness reduces the list to 20. The requirement to conduct heat reduces this further to 12. Water resistance and operating temperature do not change the shortlist further. The processes passing the screening stage are listed in Table 14.10.<br>\n <br>\n 433<br>\n <br>\n 434<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 14:<br>\n <br>\n Case Studies: Process Selection<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 14.16 A section through a domestic radiator.

This reveals that explosive welding requires special facilities and permits (hardly a surprise). Electron and laser welding require expensive equipment, so use of a shared facility might be necessary to make them economic. Resistance spot welding is screened out because it failed the requirement to be watertight, although that requirement only applies to the edge seams. Quality constraints are not severe, but distortion and residual stress will make fit-up of adjacent joints difficult. Low carbon steels are readily weldable, so it is unlikely that welding will cause cracking or embrittlement—but this can be checked by seeking documentation.<br>\n <br>\n 14.7 SURFACE-HARDENING A BALL-BEARING RACE The balls of ball races run along grooved tracks (Figure 14.17). The life of a ball race is limited by wear and fatigue. Both are suppressed by using hard materials. Hard materials, however, are not tough, incurring the risk that shock loading or mishandling might cause the race to fracture. The design requirements The solution is to use an alloy steel, which has excellent bulk properties, and to apply a separate surface treatment to increase hardness where it matters. We therefore seek processes to surfaceharden alloy steels for wear and fatigue resistance. The precision of both balls and race is critical, so the process must not compromise the dimensions or the surface smoothness. Table 14.11 summarizes the translation. The selection The CES system contains records for 46 surface treatment processes. Many are compatible with alloy steels. More discriminating is the purpose of the treatment—to impart fatigue and wear resistance—reducing the list to 8. Imposing the requirement for a very smooth surface knocks out processes that coat or deform the surface because these compromise the finish. Adding the further constraint that the curved surface coverage must be good or very good leaves just five, listed in Table 14.12. The records for these describe and illustrate the process, and summarize their typical uses.<br>\n <br>\n Inner race<br>\n <br>\n Cage<br>\n <br>\n Hardened track<br>\n <br>\n Ball<br>\n <br>\n Outer race<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 14.17 A section through a ball race.

Documentation in the records gives details.<br>\n <br>\n Postscript To get further we seek documentation for these processes. The hardness of the surface and the depth of the hardened layer depend on process variables: the time and temperature of the treatment and the composition of the steel in ways that are tabulated. And economics, of course, enters the equation. Ball races are made in enormous numbers and while their sizes vary, their geometry does not. This is where dedicated equipment, even if very expensive, is viable.<br>\n <br>\n 14.8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Process selection, at first sight, looks like a black art: The initiated know; the rest of the world cannot even guess how they do it. But this—as the chapter demonstrates—is not really so. The systematic approach, developed in Chapter 13, and illustrated here, identifies a subset of viable processes using design information only: size, shape, complexity, precision, roughness, and material—itself chosen by the systematic methods in Chapter 5. It does not identify the single, best choice; that depends on too many case-specific considerations. But, by identifying candidates, it directs the user to data sources (starting with those listed in Appendix D) that provide the details needed to make a final selection.<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 15<br>\n <br>\n Materials and the Environment<br>\n <br>\n CONTENTS 15.1 Introduction and Synopsis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 438 15.2 The Material Life-Cycle . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 438 15.3 Material and Energy-Consuming Systems . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 440 15.4 The Eco-Attributes of Materials. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 442 Material production: Energy and emissions. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 442 Estimates for material processing energies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 443 End of life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 445<br>\n <br>\n 15.5 Eco-Selection . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 447 15.6 Case Studies: Drink Containers and Crash Barriers . . . . . . . . 453 The energy content of containers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 453 Crash barriers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 454<br>\n <br>\n 15.7 Summary and Conclusions. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 457 15.8 Further Reading. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 458 Materials Selection in Mechanical Design.

The environment has some capacity to cope with this so that a certain level of impact can be absorbed without lasting damage. But it is clear that current human activities exceed this threshold with increasing frequency, diminishing the quality of the world in which we now live and threatening the well-being of future generations. The manufacture and use of products, with their associated consumption of materials and energy, are among the culprits. The position is dramatized by the following statement: At a global growth rate of 3% per year we will mine, process, and dispose of more “stuff” in the next 25 years than in the entire industrial history of mankind. Design for the environment is generally interpreted as the effort to adjust our present design methods to correct known, measurable, environmental degradation; the time scale of this thinking is 10 years or so, an average product’s expected life. Design for sustainability is the longer view: that of adaptation to a lifestyle that meets present needs without compromising the needs of future generations. The time scale here is less clear—it is measured in decades or centuries— and the adaptation required is much greater. This chapter focuses on the role of materials and processes in achieving design for the environment. Sustainability requires social and political changes that are beyond the scope of this book. The ideas in this chapter are developed further in the text that appears as the first entry in “Further reading.”<br>\n <br>\n 15.2 THE MATERIAL LIFE-CYCLE The nature of the problem is brought into focus by examining the material life-cycle shown in the sketch in Figure 15.1. Ore and feedstock, most of them nonrenewable, are processed to give materials; these are manufactured into products that are used and, at the end of their lives, disposed of, a fraction perhaps entering a recycling loop, the rest committed to incineration or landfill. Energy and materials are consumed at each point in this cycle (we shall call them “phases”), with an associated penalty of CO2 and other emissions—heat and gaseous, liquid, and solid waste. The problem, crudely put, is that the sum of these unwanted by-products now often exceeds the capacity of the environment to absorb them. Some of the injury is local in scale and its origins can be traced and remedial action taken. For some the scale is national, for others it is global, and here remedial action has wider social and organizational prerequisites. Much present environmental legislation aims at modest reductions in the damaging<br>\n <br>\n 15.2 The Material Life-Cycle<br>\n <br>\n EN E R G Y<br>\n <br>\n Energy<br>\n <br>\n FE ED S<br>\n <br>\n E N E R GY<br>\n <br>\n TO CK<br>\n <br>\n TRANSPORT<br>\n <br>\n Resources<br>\n <br>\n FE<br>\n <br>\n ED<br>\n <br>\n ST<br>\n <br>\n OC<br>\n <br>\n K<br>\n <br>\n Feedstocks TRANSPORT<br>\n <br>\n TRANSPORT<br>\n <br>\n Transport OC K<br>\n <br>\n E N E RGY<br>\n <br>\n Product manufacture<br>\n <br>\n ED ST<br>\n <br>\n E N E RGY<br>\n <br>\n FE<br>\n <br>\n TRANSPORT<br>\n <br>\n Natural resources<br>\n <br>\n Material production<br>\n <br>\n Product use<br>\n <br>\n TRANSPORT<br>\n <br>\n Emissions<br>\n <br>\n Product disposal<br>\n <br>\n CO2, NOx, SOx Particulates Toxic waste Low-grade heat<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 15.1 The material life-cycle.

Sustainability requires solutions of a completely different kind. Even conservative estimates of the adjustment needed to restore long-term equilibrium with the environment envisage a reduction in the flows of Figure 15.1 by a factor of four or more. Population growth and the growth of the expectations of this population more than cancel any modest savings that the developed nations may achieve. It is here that the challenge is greatest, requiring difficult adaptation; it is one for which no generally agreed-on solutions yet exist. But it remains the long-term driver of eco-design, to be retained as background to any creative thinking.<br>\n <br>\n 439<br>\n <br>\n 440<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 15:<br>\n <br>\n Materials and the Environment<br>\n <br>\n 15.3 MATERIAL AND ENERGY-CONSUMING SYSTEMS It would seem that the obvious ways to conserve materials are to make products smaller, make them last longer, and recycle them when they finally reach the end of their lives. But the seemingly obvious can sometimes be deceptive. Materials and energy form part of a complex and highly interactive system, as illustrated in Figure 15.2. Here primary catalysts of consumption such as new technology, planned obsolescence, increasing wealth, education, and population growth influence aspects of product use and through these the consumption of materials and energy and the by-products that these produce. The connecting lines indicate influences; a green line suggests positive, broadly desirable influence; a red line suggests negative, undesirable influence; and red-green suggests that the driver has the capacity for both positive and negative influence. The diagram brings out the complexity. Follow, for instance the lines of influence of new technology and its consequences. It offers more material and energy-efficient products, but by also offering new functionality it creates obsolescence and the desire to replace a product that has useful life left in it. Electronic products are prime examples of this: Most are discarded while Miniaturization<br>\n <br>\n Growing population New functionality Increasing wealth<br>\n <br>\n New technology<br>\n <br>\n Material consumption<br>\n <br>\n Greater recycling<br>\n <br>\n Energy consumption<br>\n <br>\n Greater material wants<br>\n <br>\n Increasing education<br>\n <br>\n Longer life Planned obsolescence<br>\n <br>\n Greater quality of life<br>\n <br>\n Industrial design Generally positive influence Generally negative influence Both positive and negative influence<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 15.2 The influences on consumption of materials and energy. It is essential to see eco-design as a systems problem, not solved by simply choosing “good” and avoiding “bad” materials but rather by matching the material to the system requirements.<br>\n <br>\n 15.3 Material and Energy-Consuming Systems<br>\n <br>\n still functional. And observe, even at this simple level, the consequences of longer life—a seemingly obvious measure. It can certainly help to conserve materials (a positive influence) but, in an era in which new technology delivers more energy-efficient products (particularly cars, electronics, and household appliances today), extending the life of old products can have a negative influence on energy consumption. As a final example, consider the bivalent influence of industrial design—the subject of Chapter 16. The lasting designs of the past are evidence of industry’s ability to create products that are treasured and conserved. But today industrial design is frequently used as a potent tool to stimulate consumption by deliberate obsolescence, creating the perception that “new” is desirable and that even slightly “old” is unappealing. The use patterns of products Table 15.1 suggests a matrix of product use patterns. Those in the first row require energy to perform their primary function. Those in the second could function without energy but, for reasons of comfort, convenience, or safety, consume energy to provide a secondary function. Those in the third row provide their primary function without any need for energy other than human effort. The load factor across the top is an approximate indicator of the intensity of use—one that will, of course, vary widely. The choice of materials and processes influences all the phases of Figure 15.1: production, through the drainage of resources and the undesired by-products of refinement; manufacture, through the level of efficiency and cleanness of the shaping, joining, and finishing processes; use, through the ability to conserve energy through lightweight design, higher thermal efficiency, and lower energy consumption; and finally disposal through a greater ability to allow reuse, disassembly, and recycling.<br>\n <br>\n Table 15.1 Use Matrix of Product Classes<br>\n <br>\n Primary powerconsuming Secondary powerconsuming Nonpowerconsuming<br>\n <br>\n High Load Factor<br>\n <br>\n Modest Load P Factor<br>\n <br>\n Family car Train set Aircraft Housing (heat, light)<br>\n <br>\n Television Freezer<br>\n <br>\n Bridges Roads<br>\n <br>\n Furniture Bicycle<br>\n <br>\n Parking lot (light)<br>\n <br>\n High impact<br>\n <br>\n Low Load Factor Coffee maker Vacuum cleaner Washing machine Household dishes Clothing (washing) Canoe Tent<br>\n <br>\n Low impact<br>\n <br>\n Energy intense<br>\n <br>\n Material intense<br>\n <br>\n 441<br>\n <br>\n Materials and the Environment<br>\n <br>\n Civil aircraft<br>\n <br>\n Family car<br>\n <br>\n Appliance (refrigerator)<br>\n <br>\n Mat.

Simplifying for a moment, let us take energy consumption as a measure of both the inputs and undesired by-products of each phase and use it for a character appraisal of use sectors. Figure 15.3 presents the evidence, using this measure. It has two significant features, with important implications. The first feature is that one phase almost always dominates, accounting for 80% or more of the energy, sometimes much more. If large changes are to be achieved, it is this phase that must be the target; a reduction by a factor of 2, even of 10, in any other makes little significant difference to the total. The second feature: When differences are as great as those of Figure 15.3, precision is not the issue—an error of a factor of 2 changes very little. It is the nature of people who measure things to wish to do so with precision, and precise data must be the ultimate goal. But it is possible to move forward without precision: Precise judgments can be drawn from imprecise data. This is an important consideration: Much information about eco-attributes is imprecise.<br>\n <br>\n 15.4 THE ECO-ATTRIBUTES OF MATERIALS Material production: Energy and emissions Most of the energy consumed in the four phases of Figure 15.1 is derived from fossil fuels. Some is consumed in that state—as gas, oil, coal, or coke. Much is first converted to electricity at a European average conversion<br>\n <br>\n 15.4 The Eco-Attributes of Materials<br>\n <br>\n efficiency of about 38%. Not all electricity is generated from fossil fuels— there are contributions from hydroelectric, nuclear, and wind/wave sources. But with the exception of Norway (70% hydro) and France (80% nuclear), the predominant energy sources are fossil fuels; and since the national grids of European countries are linked, with power flowing from one to another as needed, it is adequate here to think of a European average fossil-fuel energy per kilowatt of delivered electrical power. The fossil-fuel energy consumed in making one kilogram of material is called its embodied energy. Some of the energy is stored in the created material and can be reused, in one sense or another, at the end of life. Polymers made from oil (as most are) contain energy in another sense—that of the oil that enters the production as a primary feedstock. Natural materials such as wood similarly contain “intrinsic” or “contained” energy, this time derived from solar radiation absorbed during growth. Views differ on whether intrinsic energy should be included in embodied energy or not. There is a sense in which not only polymers and woods but also metals carry intrinsic energy that could—by chemical reaction or by burning the metal in the form of finely divided powder—be recovered, so omitting it when reporting production energy for polymers but including it for metals seems inconsistent. For this reason we will include intrinsic energy from nonrenewable resources in reporting embodied energies, which generally lie in the range of 25 to 250 MJ/kg, though a few are much higher. The existence of intrinsic energy has another consequence: The energy to recycle a material is sometimes much less than that required for its first production, because the intrinsic energy is retained. Typical values lie in the range 10 to 100 MJ/kg. The production of 1 kilogram of material is associated with undesired gas emissions, among which CO2, NOx, SOx, and CH4 cause general concern (global warming, acidification, ozone-layer depletion). The quantities can be large— each kilogram of virgin aluminum produced with energy from fossil fuels creates some 9 kilograms of CO 2, 40 grams of NOx , and 90 grams of SOx (Table 15.2). Material production is generally associated with other undesirable outputs, particularly toxic wastes and particulates, but these can, in principle, be dealt with at the source. Approximate data for embodied energy and CO2 burden of materials are listed in Appendix A.<br>\n <br>\n Estimates for material processing energies (at an overall conversion efficiency of 15%) Many processes depend on casting, evaporation, or deformation. It is helpful to have a feel for the approximate magnitudes of energies required by these.

Many processes use electric energy, generated from primary energy with a conversion efficiency on the order of 38%. The use of this for electroheating or for electroprocessing (like electroforming) involves further losses. Scrap, discarded material, and other wastes carry with them an energy investment that does not appear in the “good” casting, moldings, or forgings that are the output of the processes. Other process routes involve other energy conversion sequences, all with their losses. It is possible, as we do below, to estimate the energy to melt, mold, vaporize, or deform a material, but to express this in terms of primary energy it must be divided by the product of the conversion efficiencies of each conversion step. For the sake of example we set this overall efficiency at a (realistic) 15%. Melting To melt a material, it must first be heated to its melting point, requiring a minimum input of the heat Cp (Tm − T0), and then caused to melt, requiring the latent heat of melting Lm: Hmin = Cp ðTm − T0 Þ + Lm<br>\n <br>\n (15.1)<br>\n <br>\n where H min is the minimum energy per kilogram for melting, C p is the specific heat, Tm is the melting point, and T0 is the ambient temperature. A close correlation exists between Lm and Cp Tm:<br>\n <br>\n 15.4 The Eco-Attributes of Materials<br>\n <br>\n Lm ≈ 0:4 Cp Tm<br>\n <br>\n (15.2)<br>\n <br>\n and for metals and alloys Tm &gt;&gt; T0, giving Hmin ≈ 1:4 Cp Tm<br>\n <br>\n (15.3)<br>\n <br>\n  Assuming efficiency of 15%, the estimated energy to melt 1 kilogram Hm is  Hm ≈ 8:4 Cp Tm<br>\n <br>\n (15.4)<br>\n <br>\n the asterisk recalling that it is an estimate. For metals and alloys, the  quantity Hm lies in the range 1 to 8 MJ/kg. Vaporization As a rule of thumb, the latent heat of vaporization Lv is larger than that for melting, Lm, by a factor of 24 ± 5, and the boiling point Tb is larger than the melting point T m by a factor 2.1 ± 0.5. Using the same assumptions as before, we find an estimate for the energy to evaporate 1 kg of material (as in PVD processing) to be Hv ≈ 76 Cp Tm<br>\n <br>\n (15.5)<br>\n <br>\n again assuming an efficiency of 15%. For metals and alloys, the quantity Hv lies in the range 6 to 60 MJ/kg. Deformation Deformation processes like rolling or forging generally involve large strains. Assuming an average flow strength of ðσ y + σ uts Þ/2, a strain of order 1, and an efficiency factor of 15%, we find, the work of deformation per kg, to be WD ≈ 3ðσ y + σ uts Þ<br>\n <br>\n (15.6)<br>\n <br>\n where σy is the yield strength and σuts is the tensile strength. For metals and alloys, the quantity WD lies in the range 0.05 to 2 MJ/kg. We conclude that casting or deformation requires processing energies that are small compared to the production energy of the material being processed, but the larger energies required for vapor-phase processing may become comparable with those for material production.<br>\n <br>\n End of life Figure 15.4 introduces the options: landfill, combustion for heat recovery, recycling, reengineering, and reuse. Landfill Much of what we now reject is committed to landfill. Already there is a problem—the land available to “fill” in this way is already, in some European countries, almost full. Administrations react by charging a landfill tax—currently somewhere near €50 per tonne and rising, seeking to divert waste into the other channels of Figure 15.4.<br>\n <br>\n 445<br>\n <br>\n Materials and the Environment<br>\n <br>\n Product manufacture<br>\n <br>\n Material production<br>\n <br>\n cl cy yc nc Dow<br>\n <br>\n Re<br>\n <br>\n e<br>\n <br>\n le<br>\n <br>\n Combustion<br>\n <br>\n Product use<br>\n <br>\n se<br>\n <br>\n Natural resources<br>\n <br>\n eu<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 15:<br>\n <br>\n Reengineer Recondition<br>\n <br>\n 446<br>\n <br>\n R<br>\n <br>\n End of first life<br>\n <br>\n Landfill<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 15.4 End of life options: landfill, combustion, recycling, refurbishment or upgrading, and reuse.<br>\n <br>\n Combustion for heat recovery Materials, we know, contain energy. Rather than throw them away it would seem better to retrieve and reuse some of their energy by controlled combustion, capturing the heat. But this is not as easy as it sounds. First there is the need for a primary sorting to separate combustibles from noncombustible material. Then the combustion must be carried out under conditions that do not generate toxic fumes or residues, requiring high temperatures, sophisticated control, and expensive equipment. Energy recovery is imperfect partly because it is incomplete and partly because the incoming waste carries a moisture content that has to be boiled off. Recycling Recycling requires energy, and this energy carries its burden of gases. But the recycle energy is generally small compared to the initial production energy, making recycling—when it is possible at all—an energyefficient proposition. It may not, however, be one that is cost-efficient; that depends on the degree to which the material has become dispersed. In-house scrap, generated at the point of production or manufacture, is localized and is already recycled efficiently (near 100% recovery). Widely distributed “scrap”—material contained in discarded products—is much more expensive to collect, separate, and clean. Many materials cannot be recycled, although they may still be reused in a lower-grade activity; continuous-fiber composites, for instance, cannot be reseparated economically into fiber and polymer in order to recycle them, though they can be chopped and used as fillers. Most other materials require an input of virgin material to avoid build-up of uncontrollable impurities. Thus the<br>\n <br>\n 15.5 Eco-Selection<br>\n <br>\n fraction of a material’s production that can ultimately reenter the cycle of Figure 15.4 depends both on the material itself and on the product into which it has been incorporated. Reengineering Reengineering is the refurbishment or upgrading of the product or of its recoverable components. Certain criteria must be met to make it practical. One is that the design of the product is fixed or that the technology on which it is based is evolving so slowly that there remains a market for the restored product. Some examples are housing, office space, and road and rail infrastructure; these are sectors with enormous appetites for materials. Reuse Reuse is the redistribution of the product to a consumer sector that is willing to accept it in its used state, perhaps to reuse it for its original purpose (e.g., a second-hand car), perhaps to adapt it to another (converting a car into a hot rod or a bus into a mobile home). Charity stores pass on clothing, books, and objects acquired from those for whom they had become waste; the stores sell them to others who perceive them to have value. Reuse is the most benign of the end-of-life scenarios.<br>\n <br>\n 15.5 ECO-SELECTION To select materials to minimize impact on the environment we must first ask—as we did in Section 15.2—which phase of the life-cycle of the product under consideration makes the largest contribution. The answer guides the choice of strategy to ameliorate that contribution (Figure 15.5). The strategies are described in the following sections. The material production phase If material production is the dominant phase of life, this becomes the first target. Drink containers (Figure 15.6) provide an example: They consume materials and energy during material extraction and production, but apart from transport and refrigeration, which are small, not thereafter. We use the energy consumed in extracting and refining the material (the embodied energy noted in Table 15.2) as the measure; CO2, NOx, and SOx emissions are related to it, although not in a simple way. The energy associated with the production of 1 kilogram of a material is Hp, that per unit volume is Hpρ, where ρ is the density of the material. The bar charts of Figures 15.7 and 15.8 show these two quantities for ceramics, metals, polymers, and composites (hybrids). On a “per kg” basis (upper chart), glass, the material of the first container, carry the lowest penalty. Steel is slightly higher. Polymers carry a much higher energy penalty than steel. Aluminum and the other light alloys carry the highest penalty of all. But if these same materials are compared on a “per m3” basis (lower chart) the conclusions change: Glass is still the lowest, but now commodity polymers, such<br>\n <br>\n 447<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 15:<br>\n <br>\n Materials and the Environment<br>\n <br>\n 1.

But is comparison “per kg” or “per m3” the right way to do it? Rarely. To deal with environmental impact at the production phase properly we must seek to minimize the energy, the CO2 burden, or the eco-indicator value per unit of function. Performance indices that include energy content are derived in the same way as those for weight or cost (Chapter 5).

Repeating the derivations of Chapter 5 but with the objective of minimizing embodied energy rather than mass leads to performance equations and material indices that are simply those of Chapter 5 with ρ replaced by Hpρ.

They are used in exactly the same way as the E − ρ and σ f − ρ charts for minimum mass design. Most polymers are derived from oil. This leads to statements that they are energy-intense, with implications for their future. The two charts in Figures 5.9 and 5.10 show that, per unit of function in bending (the commonest mode of loading), most polymers carry a lower energy penalty than primary aluminum, magnesium, or titanium, and several are competitive with steel. Most of the energy consumed in the production of metals such as steel, aluminum, a magnesium is used to reduce the ore to the elemental metal, so that these materials, when recycled, require much less energy.

It is used in the same way as Figure 4.4.<br>\n <br>\n The product manufacture phase Shaping materials, as we discussed earlier, requires energy. Certainly it is important to save energy in production. But higher priority often attaches to the local impact of emissions and toxic waste during manufacture, and this depends crucially on local circumstances. Paper making (to take an example) uses very large quantities of water. Historically the wastewater was heavily polluted with alkalis and particulates, devastating the river systems into which it was dumped. Today, the best paper mills discharge water that is as clean and pure as it was when it entered. Production sites of the former communist-bloc countries are terminally polluted; those producing the same materials elsewhere, using best-practice methods, have no such problems. Clean manufacture is the issue here. The use phase The eco-impact of the use phase of energy-consuming products has nothing to do with the energy content of the materials<br>\n <br>\n 15.6 Case Studies: Drink Containers and Crash Barriers<br>\n <br>\n themselves—indeed, minimizing this may frequently have the opposite effect on use energy. Use energy depends on mechanical, thermal, and electrical efficiencies; it is minimized by maximizing these. Fuel efficiency in transport systems (measured, say, by MJ/km) correlates closely with the mass of the vehicle itself; the objective then becomes minimizing mass. Energy efficiency in refrigeration or heating systems is achieved by minimizing the heat flux into or out of the system; the objective is then minimizing thermal conductivity or thermal inertia. Energy efficiency in electrical generation, transmission, and conversion is maximized by minimizing the ohmic losses in the conductor; here the objective is minimizing electrical resistance while meeting necessary constraints on strength, cost, and so on. Selection to meet these objectives is exactly what the previous chapters of this book were about. The product disposal phase The environmental consequences of the final phase of product life has many aspects. Increasingly, legislation dictates disposal procedures, take-back, and recycle requirements, and—through landfill taxes and subsidized recycling—deploys market forces to determine the end-of-life choice.<br>\n <br>\n 15.6 CASE STUDIES: DRINK CONTAINERS AND CRASH BARRIERS The energy content of containers The containers shown earlier in Figure 15.6 are examples of products for which the first and second phases of life—material production and product manufacture—consume the most energy and generate the most emissions. Thus material selection to minimize energy and consequent gas and particle emissions focuses on these. Table 15.3 summarizes the requirements. The masses of five competing container types, the material of which they are made, and the specific energy content of each are listed in Tables 15.4 and 15.5.

Only in the case of glass is the forming energy significant. The dominant phase is material production. Summing the two energies for each material and multiplying by the container mass per liter of capacity gives the ranking shown in the second to last column of Table 15.4. Steel can carry the lowest energy penalty, glass and aluminum the highest.<br>\n <br>\n Crash barriers Barriers to protect the driver and passengers in road vehicles are of two types: those that are static—the central divider of a freeway, for instance— and those that move—the bumper of the vehicle itself (Figure 15.11). The static types line tens of thousands of miles of road. Once in place they consume no energy, create no CO2, and last a long time. The dominant phases of their life in the sense of the life-cycle shown in Figure 15.1 are material production and manufacture. The bumper, by contrast, is part of the vehicle; it adds to its weight and thus to its fuel consumption. The dominant phase here is use. This means that, if eco-design is the objective, the criteria for selecting materials for the two sorts of barrier will differ. We take as a criterion for the first that of maximizing the energy that the<br>\n <br>\n 15.6 Case Studies: Drink Containers and Crash Barriers<br>\n <br>\n Reaction from supports<br>\n <br>\n Impact W<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 15.11 Two crash barriers: one static, the other—the bumper—attached to something that moves.

Table 15.6 summarizes. In an impact, the barrier is loaded in bending (Figure 15.11). Its function is to transfer load from the point of impact to the support structure, where reaction from the foundation or from crush elements in the vehicle support or absorb it. To do this the material of the barrier must have high strength, σf, be adequately tough and able to be recycled. That of the static barrier must meet these constraints with minimum embodied energy as the objective, since this will reduce the overall life energy most effectively.

We leave that as one of the exercises in order to show here an alternative: simply plotting the index itself as a bar chart. Figures 15.12 and 15.13 show the result for metals, polymers, and polymer-matrix composites. The first guides the selection for static barriers. It shows that embodied energy (for a given load-bearing capacity) is minimized by making the barrier out of carbon steel or cast iron or wood; nothing else comes close. The second figure guides selection for the mobile barrier. Here CFRP (continuous fiber carbon epoxy, for instance) excels in its strength per unit weight, but it is not recyclable. Heavier but recyclable are alloys of magnesium, titanium, and aluminum. Polymers, which rank poorly in the first figure, now become candidates—even without reinforcement, they can be as good as steel. Postscript Metal crash barriers have a profile like that shown in Figure 15.11 (left). The curvature increases the second moment of area of the crosssection and through this the bending stiffness and strength.

Dealing with all of these requires data not only for the obvious eco-attributes (e.g., energy, CO 2 and other emissions, toxicity, and the ability to be recycled) but also for mechanical, thermal, electrical, and chemical properties. Thus if material production is the phase of concern, selection is based on minimizing production energy or the associated emissions (e.g., CO2 production). But if it is the use phase that is of concern, selection is based instead on light weight and excellence as a thermal insulator or as an electrical conductor (while meeting other constraints on stiffness, strength, cost, etc.). This chapter developed methods to deal with these issues. The methods are most effective when implemented in software. The CES Edu system, described in Chapters 5, 6, 13, and 14 contains eco-data for materials and includes an eco-audit tool to analyze product life in the manner of Figure 15.3.<br>\n <br>\n 457<br>\n <br>\n 458<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 15:<br>\n <br>\n Materials and the Environment<br>\n <br>\n If you found this chapter interesting and would like to read more, you will find the ideas it contains developed more fully in the first book listed in the following section.<br>\n <br>\n 15.8 FURTHER READING Ashby, M.F.

Excellent design also gives pleasure. Pleasure derives from form, color, texture, feel, and the associations that these invoke. Pleasing design says something about itself; generally speaking, honest statements are more satisfying than deception, though eccentric or humorous designs can be appealing too. Materials play a central role in this. A major reason for introducing new materials is the greater freedom of design that they allow. Metals, during the past century, allowed the building of structures that could not have been built before: cast iron, the Crystal Palace; wrought iron, the Eiffel Tower; drawn steel cable, the Golden Gate Bridge—all undeniably beautiful. Polymers lend themselves to bright colors, satisfying textures, and great freedom of form; they have opened new styles of design, of which some of the best examples are found in household appliances: Food mixers, hair dryers, mobile phones, MP3 players, and vacuum cleaners make extensive and imaginative use of materials to allow styling, weight, feel, and form that give pleasure. Those who concern themselves with this aesthetic dimension of engineering are known, rather confusingly, as “industrial designers.” This chapter introduces some of the ideas of industrial design, emphasizing the role of materials. It ends with case studies. But first a word of caution. Previous chapters dealt with systematic ways of choosing material and processes. “Systematic” means that if you do it and I do it, following the same procedure, we will get the same result, and that result, next year, will be the same as it is today. Industrial design is not, in this sense, systematic. Succes, here involves sensitivity to fashion, custom, and educational background, and is influenced (even manipulated) by advertising and association. The views in this chapter are partly those of writers who seem to me to say sensible things,<br>\n <br>\n 16.2 The Requirements Pyramid<br>\n <br>\n and partly my own. You may not agree with them, but if they make you think about designing to give pleasure, the chapter has done what it should. The ideas in this chapter are developed more fully in the first text listed in “Further reading.”<br>\n <br>\n 16.2 THE REQUIREMENTS PYRAMID The pen with which I am writing this chapter cost $5 (Figure 16.1, upper image). If you go to the right shop, you can find a pen that costs well over $1000 (lower image). Does it write 200 times better than mine? Unlikely; mine writes perfectly well. Yet there is a market for expensive pens. Why? A product has a cost—the outlay in manufacture and marketing it. It has a price—the sum at which it is offered to the consumer. And it has a value—a measure of what the consumer thinks it is worth. The expensive pens command the price they do because the consumer perceives their value to justify it. What determines value? Three things. Functionality, provided by sound technical design, clearly plays a role. The requirements pyramid in Figure 16.2 has this as its base: The product must work properly and be safe and economical. Functionality alone is not enough: The product must be easy to understand and operate, and these are questions of usability, the second tier in the figure. The third, completing the pyramid, is the requirement that the product give satisfaction: that it enhances the life of those who own or use it.<br>\n <br>\n Industrial design<br>\n <br>\n Technical design<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 16.1 Pens, inexpensive and expensive. The chosen material—acrylic in the upper two; gold, silver, and enamel in the lower two—creates the aesthetics and the associations of the pens. (Bottom image courtesy of David Nishimura, Vintagepens.com.)<br>\n <br>\n Satisfaction Product must be life-enhancing Usability Product must be easy to understand and use<br>\n <br>\n Product design<br>\n <br>\n Functionality Product must be work properly, be safe and be economical<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 16.2 The requirements pyramid. The lower part of the pyramid tends to be called “technical design,” the upper part, “industrial design,” suggesting that they are separate activities. It is better to think of all three tiers as part of a single process that we shall call “product design.”<br>\n <br>\n 463<br>\n <br>\n 464<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 16:<br>\n <br>\n Materials and Industrial Design<br>\n <br>\n The value of a product is a measure of the degree to which it meets (or exceeds) the expectation of the consumer for all three of these—functionality, usability, and satisfaction. Think of this as the product. It is very like human character. An admirable character is one that functions well, interacts effectively, and is rewarding company. An unappealing character is one that does none of these. An odious character is one that behaves in such an unattractive way that you cannot bear to be near them. Products are the same. All the pens in Figure 16.1 function well and are easy to use. The huge difference in price implies that the lower two provide a degree of satisfaction not offered by the upper two. The most obvious difference between them is the materials of which they are made—the upper pair of molded acrylic, the lower pair of gold, silver, and enamel. Acrylic is the material of toothbrush handles, something you throw away after use. Gold and silver are the materials of precious jewelry; they have associations of craftsmanship, of heirlooms passed from one generation to the next. Well, that’s part of the difference, but there is more. To find it we need to address a question—what creates product character?<br>\n <br>\n 16.3 PRODUCT CHARACTER Figure 16.3 shows a way of dissecting product character. It is a map of the ideas we are going to explore; like all maps there is a lot of detail, but we need it to find our way. In the center is information about the product itself: the basic design requirements, its function, its features. The way these are thought through and developed is conditioned by the context, shown in the circle above the product. The context is set by the answers to the questions in the top box: Who? Where? When? Why? Consider the first of these: Who? A designer seeking to create a product attractive to women will make choices that differ from those for a product intended for children, or for elderly people, or for sportsmen. Where? A product for use in the home requires a different choice of material and form than one to be used—say—in a school or hospital. When? One intended for occasional use is designed in a different way from one used all the time; one for formal occasions differs from one for informal use. Why? A product that is primarily utilitarian involves different design decisions from one that is largely a lifestyle statement. The context influences and conditions all the decisions that the designer makes in finding a solution. It sets the mood.1 On the left of the product circle of Figure 16.3 lie packages of information about the materials and the processes used to shape, join, and finish it. Each 1 Many designers working on a project assemble a mood board with images of the sort of people for whom the product is intended, the surroundings in which they suppose it will be used, and other products that the intended user group might own, seeking to capture the flavor of their lifestyle.<br>\n <br>\n 16.3 Product Character<br>\n <br>\n Who?<br>\n <br>\n Men/women Children/elderly...<br>\n <br>\n Where?<br>\n <br>\n Home/office Europe/Africa...<br>\n <br>\n When?<br>\n <br>\n Day/night All the time/occasionally...<br>\n <br>\n Why?<br>\n <br>\n To fill a basic need To meet an aspiration...<br>\n <br>\n Aesthetics 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000<br>\n <br>\n Steels<br>\n <br>\n Ceramics<br>\n <br>\n Cu-alloys<br>\n <br>\n Polymers<br>\n <br>\n Al-alloys<br>\n <br>\n Metals<br>\n <br>\n Ti-alloys Ni-alloys Zn-alloys<br>\n <br>\n Natural<br>\n <br>\n Context<br>\n <br>\n Materials<br>\n <br>\n Product<br>\n <br>\n Associations<br>\n <br>\n Wealth, power Learning, sophistication Plants, animals High-tech<br>\n <br>\n Perceptions<br>\n <br>\n Playful/serious Feminine/masculine Expensive/cheap Youthful/mature<br>\n <br>\n Personality<br>\n <br>\n Features Function<br>\n <br>\n Composites<br>\n <br>\n Processes<br>\n <br>\n Color, transparency Form, symmetry Feel, texture Sound<br>\n <br>\n Usability<br>\n <br>\n Joining Compression<br>\n <br>\n Casting<br>\n <br>\n Rotation<br>\n <br>\n Deformation<br>\n <br>\n Injection<br>\n <br>\n Molding<br>\n <br>\n RTM<br>\n <br>\n Composite<br>\n <br>\n Blow<br>\n <br>\n Powder<br>\n <br>\n Vacuum<br>\n <br>\n Physical matching<br>\n <br>\n Bio-metric Bio-mechanical<br>\n <br>\n Scale, movement Posture, work height Force, energy Attention span<br>\n <br>\n Shaping<br>\n <br>\n Rapid prototype Surfacing<br>\n <br>\n Information transfer<br>\n <br>\n Operation Feedback<br>\n <br>\n MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n Product “physiology”<br>\n <br>\n Text, icons Symbols Audible signals Visual signals Tactile signals<br>\n <br>\n Product “psychology”<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 16.3 The breakdown of product character. Context defines the intentions or “mood”; materials and processes create the flesh and bones; the user interface determines usability ; and the product’s aesthetics, associations, and perceptions create its personality.<br>\n <br>\n illustrates the library, so to speak, from which the choices can be made. They are the families, classes, and members that we first met in Chapter 3. Choosing these to provide functionality—the bottom of the pyramid—has been the subject of this book so far. Material and process give the product its tangible form, its flesh and bones so to speak; they create the product physiology. On the right in Figure 16.3 are two more packages of information. The lower one—usability—characterizes the ways in which the product communicates<br>\n <br>\n 465<br>\n <br>\n 466<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 16:<br>\n <br>\n Materials and Industrial Design<br>\n <br>\n with the user: the interaction with their sensory, cognitive, and motor functions. Product success requires a mode of operation that, as far as possible, is intuitive and does not require taxing effort, and an interface that communicates the state of the product and its response to user action by visible, acoustic, or tactile response. It is remarkable how many products fail in this and, by doing so, exclude many of their potential users. There is today an awareness of this, giving rise to research on inclusive design: design to make products that can be used by a larger spectrum of the population. One package remains: the one labeled personality. Product personality derives from aesthetics, associations, and perceptions, three words that need explanation. Anaesthetics dull the senses. Aesthetics do the opposite: They stimulate the five senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell, and via them, the brain. The first row of the personality box elaborates: We are concerned here with color, form, texture, feel, smell, and sound. Think of a new car: its styling, its smell, the sound its doors make on closing. They are no accident. Car makers spend millions to make them as they are. A products also has associations—the second row of the box. Associations are the things the product reminds you of, the things it suggests. The Land Rover and other SUVs have forms and (often) colors that mimic those of military vehicles. The streamlining of American cars of the 1960s and 1970s carried associations with aerospace. It may be an accident that the VW Beetle has a form that suggests the insect, but the others are no accident; they were deliberately chosen by the designer to appeal to the consumer group (the Who?) at which the product was aimed. Finally, the most abstract quality of all, perceptions. Perceptions are the reactions the product induces in an observer, the way it makes you feel. Table 16.1 Some Perceived Attributes of Products Perceptions (with Opposites) Aggressive—Passive Cheap—Expensive Classic—Trendy Clinical—Friendly Clever—Silly Common—Exclusive Decorated—Plain Delicate—Rugged Disposable—Lasting Dull—Sexy Elegant—Clumsy<br>\n <br>\n Extravagant—Restrained Feminine—Masculine Formal—Informal Handmade—Mass-produced Honest—Deceptive Humorous—Serious Informal—Formal Irritating—Lovable Lasting—Disposable Mature—Youthful Retro—Futuristic<br>\n <br>\n 16.4 Using Materials and Processes to Create Product Personality<br>\n <br>\n Here there is room for disagreement; the perceptions of a product change with time and depend on the culture and background of the observer. Yet in the final analysis it is the perception that causes the consumer, when choosing between a multitude of similar models, to prefer one above the others; it creates the “must have” feeling (see chapter cover image). Table 16.1 lists some perceptions with their opposites in order to sharpen the meaning. They derive from product reviews and magazines specializing in product design; they are a part of a vocabulary, one that is used to communicate views about product character.<br>\n <br>\n 16.4 USING MATERIALS AND PROCESSES TO CREATE PRODUCT PERSONALITY Do materials, of themselves, have a personality? There is a school of thinking that holds as a central tenet that materials must be used “honestly.” This means that deception and disguise are unacceptable—each material must be used in ways that expose its intrinsic qualities and natural appearance. It has its roots in the tradition of craftsmanship—potters’ use of clays and glazes, carpenters’ use of woods, the skills of silversmiths and glass makers in crafting beautiful objects that exploit the unique qualities of the materials with which they work and the integrity of their craft. This is a view to be respected. But it is not the only one. Design integrity is a quality that consumers value, but they also value other qualities: humor, sympathy, surprise, provocation, even shock. You don’t have to look far to find a product that has one of these, and often that quality is achieved by using materials in ways that deceive. Polymers are frequently used in this way—their adaptability invites it. And, of course, it is partly a question of definition—if you say that a characterizing attribute of polymers is their ability to mimic other materials, then using them in this way is honest.<br>\n <br>\n Materials and the senses: Aesthetic attributes Aesthetic attributes are those that relate to the senses: touch, sight, hearing, taste, and smell (Table 16.2). Almost everyone would agree that metals feel “cold”; that cork feels “warm”; that a wine glass, when struck, “rings”; that a pewter mug sounds “dull,” even “dead.” A polystyrene water glass can look indistinguishable from one made of glass, but pick it up and it feels lighter, less cold, less rigid; tap it and it does not sound the same. It leaves the impression that is so different from glass that, in an expensive restaurant, it would be completely unacceptable. Materials, then, have certain characterizing aesthetic attributes. Let us see if we can pin these down.<br>\n <br>\n 467<br>\n <br>\n 468<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 16:<br>\n <br>\n Materials and Industrial Design<br>\n <br>\n Table 16.2 Some Aesthetic Attributes of Materials Sense<br>\n <br>\n Attribute 8 Warm &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; Cold Soft Touch &gt; Hard &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : Flexible Stiff 8 Optically clear &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Transparent &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Translucent &gt; &lt; Opaque Sight &gt; Reflective &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Glossy &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : Matte Textured<br>\n <br>\n Sense<br>\n <br>\n Attribute 8 Muffled &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dull &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; Sharp Hearing &gt; Resonant &gt; &gt; Ringing &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : High-pitched Low-pitched<br>\n <br>\n ( Taste Smell<br>\n <br>\n Bitter Sweet<br>\n <br>\n Touch: Soft–hard/warm–cold Steel is “hard”; so is glass; diamond is harder than both of them. Hard materials do not scratch easily; indeed they can be used to scratch other materials. They generally accept a high polish, resist wear, and are durable. The impression that a material is hard is directly related to its Vickers hardness H. Here is an example of a sensory attribute that relates directly to a technical one. “Soft” sounds like the opposite of “hard” but it has more to do with modulus E than with hardness H. A soft material deflects when handled, it gives a little, it is squashy; but when it is released it returns to its original shape. Elastomers (rubbers) feel soft; so do polymer foams. Both have moduli that are 100 to 10,000 lower than ordinary “hard” solids; it is this that makes thempfeel ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi soft. Soft to hard is used as one axis in Figure 16.4. It uses the quantity EH as a measure. A material feels “cold” to the touch if it conducts heat away from the finger quickly; it is “warm” if it does not. This has something to do with its thermal conductivity λ but there is more to it than that—it depends also on its specific of the perceived coldness or warmth of a material is the heat Cp.

Polymer foams and low-density woods are warm and soft; so are balsa and cork. Ceramics and metals are cold and hard; so is glass. Polymers and composites lie in between. Sight: Transparency, color, reflectivity Metals are opaque. Most ceramics, because they are polycrystalline and the crystals scatter light, are either opaque or translucent. Glasses, and single crystals of some ceramics, are transparent.

Transparency is commonly described by a four-level ranking that uses easily understood everyday words: “opaque,” “translucent,” “transparent,” and “water-clear.” Figure 16.5 ranks the transparency of common materials. So that the data are spread in a useful way—they are plotted against cost. The cheapest materials offering optical-quality transparency (“water clarity”) are glass, PS, PET, and PMMA. Epoxies can be transparent but not with water clarity. Nylons are, at best, translucent. All metals, most ceramics, and all carbon-filled or reinforced polymers are opaque. Color can be quantified by analyzing spectra but this—from a design standpoint—doesn’t help much.

Opaque materials absorb light.<br>\n <br>\n matching, using color charts such as those provided by Pantone 2; once a match is found it can be described by the code that each color carries. Finally there is reflectivity, an attribute that depends partly on the material and partly on the state of its surface. Like transparency, it is commonly described by a ranking: dead matte, eggshell, semi-gloss, gloss, mirror. Hearing: Pitch and brightness The frequency of sound (pitch) emitted when p anffiffiffiffiffiffiffi object is struck relates to its material properties. A measure of this pitch E/ρ is used as one axis in Figure 16.6. Frequency is not the only aspect of acoustic response—the other has to do with the damping or loss coefficient η. A highly damped material sounds dull and muffled; one with low damping rings. Acoustic brightness—the inverse of damping—is used as the other axis in Figure 16.6. It groups materials that have similar acoustic behavior. 2<br>\n <br>\n Pantone (www.pantone.com) provides detailed advice on color selection, including color-matching charts and good descriptions of the associations and perceptions of color.<br>\n <br>\n Bright<br>\n <br>\n 16.4 Using Materials and Processes to Create Product Personality<br>\n <br>\n Pitch and brightness<br>\n <br>\n Cu alloys Ti alloys Glass<br>\n <br>\n Technical ceramics<br>\n <br>\n Metals B4 C SiC<br>\n <br>\n Acoustic brightness<br>\n <br>\n Nontechnical ceramics Polymers<br>\n <br>\n Si3N4<br>\n <br>\n Ni alloys Steels<br>\n <br>\n Zinc alloys Cast Stone irons PA<br>\n <br>\n WC<br>\n <br>\n Al alloys CFRP<br>\n <br>\n Foams<br>\n <br>\n Flexible polymer foams<br>\n <br>\n PMMA PS PP PTFE PE<br>\n <br>\n Polyurethane<br>\n <br>\n EVA Silicones<br>\n <br>\n Mg alloys GFRP<br>\n <br>\n Cork<br>\n <br>\n Lead alloys Rigid polymer foams Ionomers Leather<br>\n <br>\n Dull<br>\n <br>\n Butyl Isoprene rubber Natural rubber<br>\n <br>\n Composites<br>\n <br>\n Wood Brick ABS Concrete<br>\n <br>\n Elastomers<br>\n <br>\n Neoprene<br>\n <br>\n Al2O3<br>\n <br>\n MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n Low<br>\n <br>\n Acoustic pitch<br>\n <br>\n High<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 16.6 Acoustic properties of materials. The “ring” of a wine glass occurs because glass is an acoustically bright material with a high natural pitch; the dull “ping” of a plastic glass occurs because polymers are much less bright and—in the same shape—vibrate at a lower frequency. Materials at the top right make good bells; those at the bottom left are good for damping sound.<br>\n <br>\n Bronze, glass, and steel ring when struck, and the sound they emit has—on a relative scale—a high pitch; they are used to make bells. Alumina, on this ranking, has bell-like qualities. Rubber, foams, and many polymers sound dull and, relative to metals, vibrate at low frequencies; they are used for sound damping. Lead, too, is dull and low-pitched; it is used to clad buildings for sound insulation. The three figures show that each material class has a certain recognizable aesthetic character. Ceramics are hard, cold, high-pitched, and acoustically bright. Metals, too, are relatively hard and cold but although some (e.g., bronze) ring when struck, others (e.g., lead) are dull. Polymers and foams are most nearly like natural materials—warm, soft, low-pitched, and muffled, although some have outstanding optical clarity and almost all can<br>\n <br>\n 471<br>\n <br>\n 472<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 16:<br>\n <br>\n Materials and Industrial Design<br>\n <br>\n be colored. But their low hardness means that they scratch easily, losing their gloss. These qualities of a material contribute to a product’s personality. The product acquires some of the attributes of the material from which it is made, an effect that designers recognize and use when seeking to create a personality. A stainless steel fascia, whether it is in a car or on a hi-fi system, has a different personality from one of CFRP, of polished wood, or of leather, and that in part is because the product has acquired some of the aesthetic qualities of the material.<br>\n <br>\n Materials and the mind: Associations and perceptions So a material certainly has aesthetic qualities—but can it be said to have a personality? At first sight, no—it only acquires one when used in a product. Like an actor, it can assume many different personalities, depending on the role it is asked to play. Wood in fine furniture suggests craftsmanship, but in a packing case, cheap utility. Glass in the lens of a camera has associations of precision engineering, but in a beer bottle, disposable packaging. Even gold, so often associated with wealth and power, has different associations when used in microcircuits: technical functionality. But wait. The object shown in Figure 16.7 has its own somber association. It appears to be made of polished hardwood—the traditional material for such things. If you had to choose one, you would probably not think polished hardwood inappropriate. But suppose I told you it was made of polystyrene foam— would you feel the same? Suddenly it becomes a bin, a wastebasket, inappropriate for its dignified purpose. Materials, it seems, do have personality. Expression through material Think of wood. It is a natural material with a grain that has a surface texture, pattern, color, and feel that other materials do not have. It is tactile—it is perceived as warmer than many other materials and seemingly softer. It is associated with characteristic sounds and smells. It has a tradition; it carries associations of craftsmanship. No two pieces are exactly alike; the woodworker selects the piece on which he will work for its grain and texture. Wood enhances value: The interior of very inexpensive cars is plastic, that of more costly ones is burrFIGURE 16.7 walnut and calf leather. And it ages A coffin. Wood is perceived to be appropriate well, acquiring additional character for its somber, ceremonial function; plastic is with time—objects made of wood perceived to be inappropriate. are more highly valued when they<br>\n <br>\n 16.4 Using Materials and Processes to Create Product Personality<br>\n <br>\n are old than when they are new. There is more to this than just aesthetics; there are the makings of a personality, to be brought out by the designer, certainly, but there nonetheless. Now consider metal. Metals are cold, clean, precise. They ring when struck. They reflect light—particularly when polished. They are accepted and trusted: Machined metal looks strong—its very nature suggests it has been engineered. Metals are associated with robustness, reliability, and permanence. Their strength allows slender structures—the cathedral-like space of railway stations or the span of bridges. They can be worked into flowing forms, such as intricate lace or cast, into solid shapes with elaborate, complex detail. The history of humans and of metals is intertwined—the titles “Bronze age” and “Iron age” tell you how important these metals were— and their qualities are so sharply defined that that they have become ways of describing human qualities—an iron will, a silvery voice, a golden touch, a leaden look. And, like wood, metals can age well, acquiring a patina that makes them more attractive than when newly polished—the bronze of sculptures, the pewter of mugs, the lead of roofs. Ceramics and glass? They have an exceptionally long tradition—think of Greek pottery and Roman glass. They accept almost any color. Their total resistance to scratching, abrasion, discoloration, and corrosion gives them a certain immortality, threatened only by their brittleness. They are—or were—the materials of great craft-based industries: the glass of Venice, the porcelain of Meissen, the pottery of Wedgwood—valued at certain times more highly than silver. But at the same time ceramics and glass can be robust and functional— think of beer bottles. The transparency of glass gives it an ephemeral quality— sometimes you see it, sometimes you don’t. It interacts with light, transmitting it, refracting it, reflecting it. And ceramics today have additional associations— those of advanced technology: kitchen stove-tops, high-pressure/hightemperature valves, space shuttle tiles; all are materials for extreme conditions. And finally polymers. “A cheap, plastic imitation,” it used to be said—and that is a hard reputation to live down. It derives from the early use of plastics to simulate the color and gloss of Japanese handmade pottery, much valued in Europe. Commodity polymers are cheap. They are easily colored and molded (that is why they are called “plastic”), making imitation easy. Unlike ceramics, their gloss is easily scratched, and their colors fade—they do not age gracefully. You can see where the reputation came from. But is it justified? No other class of material can take on as many characters as polymers: Colored, they look like ceramics; printed, they can look like wood or textile; metallized, they look exactly like metal. They can be as transparent as glass or as opaque as lead, as flexible as rubber or as stiff—when reinforced—as aluminum. Plastics emulate precious stones in jewelry, glass in drinking glasses and glazing, wood in counter tops, velvet and fur in clothing, even grass. But despite<br>\n <br>\n 473<br>\n <br>\n 474<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 16:<br>\n <br>\n Materials and Industrial Design<br>\n <br>\n this chameleon-like behavior they do have a certain personality: They feel warm—much warmer than metal or glass. They are adaptable— that is part of their special character—and they lend themselves particularly to brightly colored, light hearted, even humorous, design. But their very cheapness creates problems as well as benefits: Our streets, countryside, and rivers are littered with discarded plastic bags and packaging that decay only very slowly. FIGURE 16.8 Lamps. Both have the same technical rating, but differ completely in their personalities. Materials, processes, form, weight, and color all contribute to personality.<br>\n <br>\n The ways in which material, processes, usability, and personality combine to create a product character tuned to context or “mood” are best illustrated by examples. Figure 16.8 illustrates the first. The lamp shown on the left is designed for the office. It is angular, functional, creamy grey, and heavy. Its form and color echo those of computer consoles and keyboards, creating associations of contemporary office technology. Its form and weight transmit the ideas of stability, robustness, efficiency, and fitness for a task—but for tasks in the workplace, not in the bedroom. Materials and processes have been chosen to reinforce these associations and perceptions. The enameled frame is pressed and folded sheet steel, the base weight is cast iron, and the reflector is stainless steel set in a high-impact ABS enclosure. The lamp on the right in Figure 16.8 has the same technical rating as the left one, as well as the same functionality and usability. But there the resemblance ends. This product is not designed for the busy executive but for children (and adults that still enjoy being children), to be used in the playroom or bedroom. It has a contoured form and contrasting translucent colors, and it is light. It is made of colored acrylic in translucent and opaque grades so that the outside glows like a neon sign when it is lit. Its form is partly derived from nature, partly from cartoons and comic strips, giving it a light hearted character. I perceive it as playful, funny, cheerful, and clever—but also as eccentric and easily damaged. You may perceive it in other ways—perception is a personal thing; it depends where you are coming from. Skilled designers manipulate perception to appeal to the user group they wish to attract. Figure 16.9 shows a second example. Here are two contrasting ways of presenting home entertainment systems. On the left: a music center aimed at successful professionals with disposable income, who are comfortable with (or addicted to) advanced technology, and for whom only the best is good enough. The linear form, the use of primitives (rectangles, circles, cylinders, cones), and the matt silver and black proclaim that this product has not just been made, it has been Designed (big D). The formal geometry and finish suggest precision instruments, telescopes, electron microscopes; the shapes resemble those of organ pipes (hence associations of music, of culture). The<br>\n <br>\n 16.4 Using Materials and Processes to Create Product Personality<br>\n <br>\n perception is that of quality cutting-edge technology, a symbol of discriminating taste. The form has much to do with these associations and perceptions, but so too do the materials: brushed aluminum, stainless steel, and black enamel—these are not materials you choose for a cuddly toy. On the right, electronics are presented in another way. This is a company that has retained market share, even increased it, by not changing, at least as far as appearance is concerned. (Fifty years ago I had a radio that looked exactly like this.) The context? Clearly, the home, perhaps aimed at consumers who are uncomfortable with modern technology (though the electronics in these radios is modern enough) or who simply feel that it clashes with the home environment. Each radio has a simple form, it is pastel-colored, it is soft and warm to touch. It is the materials that make the difference: These products are clothed in suede or leather in six or more colors. The combination of form and material creates associations of comfortable furniture, leather purses and handbags (hence luxury, comfort, style), the past (hence stability), and perceptions of solid craftsmanship, reliability, retro-appeal, and traditional but durable design. So there is a character hidden in a material even before it has been made into a recognizable form. It is a sort of embedded personality, a shy one, not always obvious, easily concealed or disguised, but one that, when appropriately manipulated, imparts its qualities to the design. It is for this reason that certain materials are so closely linked to certain design styles. Style is shorthand for a manner of design with a shared set of aesthetics, associations, and perceptions. The Early Industrial style (1800–1890)3 embraced the technologies of the Industrial Revolution, using cast iron and steel, often elaborately decorated to give it a historical façade. The Arts and Crafts Movement from 1860 to 1910 rejected this, choosing instead natural materials and fabrics to create products with the character of traditional handcrafted quality. Art Nouveau (1890–1918), by contrast, exploited the fluid shapes and durability made possible by wrought iron and cast bronze, the warmth and textures of hardwood, and the transparency of glass to create products of flowing, organic character. Art Deco (1918–1935) extended the range of materials to include for the first time plastics (Bakelite and Catalin), allowing production of both luxury products for the rich and mass-produced products for a wider market. The simplicity and explicit character of Bauhaus 3 The dates are, of course, approximate. Design styles do not switch on and off on specific dates; they emerge as a development of, or a reaction to, earlier styles with which they often coexist, and they merge into the styles that follow.<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 16.9 Consumer electronics. The system on the left is aimed at a different consumer group than the radios on the right. The personalities of each (meaning the combination of aesthetics, associations, and perceptions) have been constructed to appeal to the target group. Materials play a central role here in creating personality.

Plastics first reached maturity in product design in the cheeky iconoclastic character of the Pop Art style (1940– 1960). Since then the range of materials has continued to increase, and their role in helping to mold product character remains.<br>\n <br>\n 16.5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS What do we learn? The element of satisfaction is central to contemporary product design. It is achieved through an integration of good technical design to provide functionality, proper consideration of the needs of the user in the design of the interface, and imaginative industrial design to create a product that will appeal to the consumers at whom it is aimed. Materials play a central role in this. Functionality is dependent on the choice of proper material and process to meet the technical requirements of the design safely and economically. Usability depends on the visual and tactile properties of materials to convey information and respond to user actions. Above all, the aesthetics, associations, and perceptions of the product are strongly influenced by the choice of the material and its processing, imbuing the product with a personality that, to a greater or lesser extent, reflects that of the material itself. Consumers look for more than functionality in the products they purchase. In the sophisticated markets of developed nations, the “consumer durable” is a thing of the past. The challenge for the designer no longer lies in meeting functional requirements alone but in doing so in a way that also satisfies aesthetic and emotional needs. The product must carry the image and convey the meaning that the consumer seeks: timeless elegance, perhaps, or racy newness. One Japanese manufacturer goes so far as to say: “Desire replaces need as the engine of design.” Not everyone, perhaps, would wish to accept that idea. So we end with simpler words—the same ones with which we started. Good design works. Excellent design also gives pleasure. The imaginative use of materials provides it.

The clear message of Figure 1.1, at the start of this book, is that exactly the opposite is true: Things are changing faster now than ever before. The evolving circumstances of the world in which we live change the boundary conditions for design, and with them those for selecting materials and processes. These changes are driven by a number of forces. First, there is the market pull: the demand from industry for materials that are lighter, stiffer, stronger, tougher, cheaper, and more tolerant of extremes of temperature and environment, and that offer greater functionality. Then there is the science push: the curiosity-driven research of materials experts in the laboratories of universities, industries, and government agencies. There is the driving force of what might be called mega-projects: historically, the Manhattan Project, the development of nuclear power, the space race, and various defense programs; today, one might think of alternative energy technologies, the problems of maintaining an aging infrastructure of drainage, roads, bridges, and aircraft, and the threat of terrorism. There is the trend to miniaturization while at the same time increasing the functionality of products. There is legislation regulating product safety, and there is the increased emphasis on liability established by recent legal precedent. This chapter examines forces for change and the directions in which they push materials and their deployment. Figure 17.1 sets the scene.<br>\n <br>\n 17.2 MARKET PULL AND SCIENCE PUSH Market forces and competition The end users of materials are the manufacturing industries. They decide which materials they will purchase, and adapt their designs to make the best use of them. Their decisions are based on the nature of their products. Materials for large civil structures (which might weigh 100,000 tonnes or more) must be cheap; economy is the overriding consideration. By contrast, the cost of materials for high-tech products (sports equipment, military hardware, space projects, biomedical applications) plays a less important role: For an artificial heart valve, for instance, material cost is almost irrelevant. Performance, not economy, dictates the choice. The market price of a product has several contributions. One is the cost of the materials of which the product is made, but there is also the cost of the research and development that went into its design, the cost of manufacture and marketing, and the perceived value associated with fashion, scarcity, lack of competition, and such like—as described in Chapter 13.

Each of the influences exerts pressure to change the choice of material and process, and stimulates efforts to develop new ones. Market pull and science push are shown on the extreme right and left of the figure.<br>\n <br>\n material costs are a large part of the market value (50%, say)—that is, when the value added to the material is small—the manufacturer seeks to economize on material usage to increase profit or market share. When, by contrast, material costs are a tiny fraction of the market value (1%, say), the manufacturer seeks the materials that will most improve the performance of the product, with little concern for their cost. With this background, examine Figures 17.2 and 17.3. The vertical axis in both is the price per unit weight ($/kg) of materials and products: It gives a common measure by which materials and products can be compared. The measure is a crude one but its great merit is that it is unambiguous, easily determined, and bears some relationship to value added. A product with a price/kg that is only two or three times that of the materials of which it is made is material-intensive and is sensitive to material costs; one with a price/kg that is 100 times that of its materials is insensitive to material<br>\n <br>\n 481<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 17:<br>\n <br>\n Forces for Change<br>\n <br>\n 106 Price per kg of engineering materials Diamond<br>\n <br>\n 105<br>\n <br>\n Platinum Gold<br>\n <br>\n 104 Exotics<br>\n <br>\n Approximate material price per unit mass ($/kg)<br>\n <br>\n 482<br>\n <br>\n Sapphire<br>\n <br>\n Iridium<br>\n <br>\n 103<br>\n <br>\n Beryllium Silver<br>\n <br>\n 102 PEEK<br>\n <br>\n Ti-alloys Ni-alloys Stainless steels Mg-alloys<br>\n <br>\n 10<br>\n <br>\n Metals Al-alloys<br>\n <br>\n 1<br>\n <br>\n Glass Structural steel Oil<br>\n <br>\n 10−1<br>\n <br>\n Fuels Coal<br>\n <br>\n 10−2<br>\n <br>\n Alloy steels C-steels Cast irons<br>\n <br>\n PTFE Silicones Polymers Epoxies Nylons PMMA<br>\n <br>\n WC-Co cermets<br>\n <br>\n Al-nitride<br>\n <br>\n CFRP<br>\n <br>\n W-carbide Boron carbide Silicon carbide<br>\n <br>\n Structural composites<br>\n <br>\n Technical ceramics and glasses<br>\n <br>\n GFRP<br>\n <br>\n Alumina<br>\n <br>\n EVA, PS PP, PE<br>\n <br>\n Pyrex Glass<br>\n <br>\n Typical cost of structural materials<br>\n <br>\n Construction materials Timber Brick Concrete<br>\n <br>\n MFA, 09<br>\n <br>\n FIGURE 17.2 The price per unit weight for materials.

The shaded band spans the range in which lies most of the material of which they are made. Products in the shaded band are material-intensive; those above it are not.<br>\n <br>\n 483<br>\n <br>\n 484<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 17:<br>\n <br>\n Forces for Change<br>\n <br>\n costs, and is probably performance-driven rather than cost-driven. On this scale the price per kg of a contact lens differs from that of a glass bottle by a factor of 105, even though both are made of almost the same glass; the cost per kg of a heart valve differs from that of a plastic bottle by a similar factor, even though both are made of polyethylene. There is obviously something to be learned here. Look first at the price per unit weight of materials (refer to Figure 17.2). The bulk “commodity” materials of construction and manufacture lie in the shaded band; they all cost between $0.05 and $20/kg. Construction materials like concrete, brick, timber, and structural steel lie at the lower end; high-tech materials like titanium alloys lie at the upper. Polymers span a similar range: polyethylene at the bottom, polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) near the top. Composites lie higher, with GFRP at the bottom and CFRP at the top of the range. Engineering ceramics, at present, lie higher still, though this is changing as production increases. Only the low-volume “exotic” materials lie much above the shaded band. The price per kg of products (refer to Figure 17.3) shows a different distribution. Eight market sectors are shown, covering much of the manufacturing industry. The shaded band on this figure spans the cost of commodity materials, exactly as on the previous figure. Sectors and their products within the shaded band have the characteristic that material cost is a major fraction of product price: about 50% in civil construction, large marine structures, and some consumer packaging, falling to perhaps 20% as the top of the band is approached (family car—around 25%). The value added in converting material to product in these sectors is relatively low, but the market volume is large. These constraints condition the choice of materials: They must meet modest performance requirements at the lowest possible cost. Associated market sectors generate a driving force for improved processing of conventional materials in order to reduce cost without a loss of performance, or to increase reliability with no increase in cost. For these sectors, incremental improvements in well-tried materials are far more important than revolutionary research findings. Slight improvements in steels, in precision manufacturing methods, or in lubrication technology are quickly assimilated and used. The products in the upper half of the diagram are technically more sophisticated. The materials of which they are made account for less than 10%— sometimes less than 1%—of the price of the product. The value added to the material during manufacture is high. Product competitiveness is closely linked to material performance. Designers in these sectors have greater freedom in their choice of material and there is a readier acceptance of new materials with attractive property profiles. The market pull here is for<br>\n <br>\n 17.2 Market Pull and Science Push<br>\n <br>\n performance, with cost as a secondary consideration. These smaller-volume, higher-value-added sectors drive the development of new or improved materials with enhanced performance: materials that are lighter, or stiffer, or stronger, or tougher, or expand less, or conduct better—or all of these at once. The sectors have been ordered to form an ascending sequence, prompting the question: What does the horizontal axis measure? Many factors are involved here, one of which can be identified as “information content.” The technical knowledge involved in the manufacture of a contact lens or a heart valve is clearly greater than that needed to make a water glass or a plastic bottle. The sectors on the left make few demands on the materials they employ; those on the right push materials to their limits, and at the same time demand the highest reliability. These features make them information-intensive. But there are other factors: market size, competition (or lack of it), perceived value, advertising, fashion, and taste. For this reason, the diagram should not be over-interpreted: It is a help in structuring information, but it is not a quantitative tool. The manufacturing industry, even in times of recession, has substantial resources; it is in the interests of governments to support their needs. Market pull is ultimately the strongest force for change.<br>\n <br>\n New science: Curiosity-driven research Curiosity may kill cats, but it is the oxygen of innovative engineering. Technically advanced countries sustain the flow of new ideas by supporting research in three kinds of organization: universities, government laboratories, and industrial research laboratories. Some of the scientists and engineers working in these institutions are given the freedom to pursue ideas that may have no immediate economic objective but may evolve into the materials and manufacturing methods of future decades. Numerous nowcommercial materials started in this way. Aluminum, in the time of Napoleon III, was a scientific wonder—he commissioned a set of aluminum spoons for which he paid more than for those of solid silver. Titanium, more recently, has had a similar history. Amorphous (= noncrystalline) metals, now important in transformer technology and in recording heads of tape decks, were, for years, of only academic interest. Semiconductors and superconductors did not appear in response to market forces; it took longterm curiosity-driven research, rewarded in both cases by Nobel prizes, to reveal the principles on which they are based. Polyethylene was discovered by chemists studying the effect of pressure on chemical reactions, not by the sales or marketing departments of multinational corporations. History is dotted with examples of materials and processes that have developed from the inquisitiveness of individuals.<br>\n <br>\n 485<br>\n <br>\n 486<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 17:<br>\n <br>\n Forces for Change<br>\n <br>\n New materials, products of fundamental research, continue to emerge. Some are already entering commercial use, for others the potential is not yet clear. Some, at least, will provide opportunities for innovation; the best may create new markets. Monolithic ceramics, now produced in commercial quantities, offer high hardness, chemical stability, wear resistance, and resistance to extreme temperatures. Their use as substrates for microcircuits is established, their use in wear-resistant applications is growing, and their use in heat engines is being explored. The emphasis in the development of composite materials is shifting toward those that can support loads at higher temperatures. Metal-matrix composites (example: aluminum containing particles or fibers of siliconcarbide) and intermetallic-matrix composites (titanium-aluminide or molybdenum-disilicide containing silicon-carbide, for instance) can do this. So, potentially, can ceramic-matrix composites (alumina with silicon carbide fibers), though the extreme brittleness of these materials requires new design techniques. Metallic foams, up to 90% less dense than the parent metal, promise light, stiff sandwich structures competing with composites. Aerogels, ultra-low–density foams, provide exceptionally low thermal conductivities. New bio-materials, designed to be implanted in the human body, have structures to which growing tissue will bond without rejection. New polymers that can be used at temperatures up to 350°C allow plastics to replace metals in even more applications—the inlet manifold of the automobile engine is an example. New elastomers are flexible but strong and tough; they allow better seals, elastic hinges, and resilient coatings. Techniques for producing functionally graded materials can give tailored gradients of composition and structure through a component to make it corrosion resistant on the outer surface, tough in the middle, and hard on the inner surface. Nanostructured materials promise unique mechanical, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties. “Intelligent” materials that can sense and report their condition (via embedded sensors) allow safety margins to be reduced. Selfhealing materials have the capacity to repair service damage without human intervention. Developments in rapid prototyping now permit single complex parts to be made quickly without dies or molds from a wide range of materials. Micronscale fabrication methods create miniature electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). New techniques of surface engineering allow the alloying, coating, or heat-treating of a thin surface layer of a component, modifying its properties to enhance its performance. They include laser hardening, coatings of well-adhering polymers and ceramics, ion implantation, and even the deposition of ultra-hard carbon films with a structure and properties like those of diamond. New adhesives displace rivets and spot-welds; the<br>\n <br>\n 17.4 Product Liability and Service Provision<br>\n <br>\n glue-bonded automobile is a real possibility. And new techniques of mathematical modeling and process control allow much tighter control of composition and structure in manufacture, reducing cost and increasing reliability and safety. All these and many more are now realities. They have the potential to enable new designs and to stimulate redesign of products that already have a market, increasing their market share. The designer must stay alert.<br>\n <br>\n 17.3 GROWING POPULATION AND WEALTH AND MARKET SATURATION The world’s population continues to grow (see sector 1 in Figure 17.1). Much of this population is also growing in wealth. This wealthier population consumes more products, and as wealth increases they want still more. But thus far the growth of the world’s product-producing capacity has grown faster still, with the result that, in developed and developing countries, product markets are saturated. If you want a product—a mobile phone, a refrigerator, a car—you don’t have to stand in line with the hope of getting the only one in the store or put your name on a three-year waiting list (as was the case within living memory throughout Europe). Instead, an eager salesperson guides you through the task of selecting, from an array of near-identical products with near-identical prices, the one you think you want. This has certain consequences. One is the massive and continuing growth in consumption of energy and material resources. This, as a force for change in material selection, was the subject of Chapter 15. Another arises because in a saturated market the designer must seek new ways to attract the consumer. The more traditional reliance on engineering qualities to sell a product are replaced (or augmented) by visual qualities, associations, and carefully managed perceptions created by industrial design. This, too, influences material and process choice; it was the subject of Chapter 16.<br>\n <br>\n 17.4 PRODUCT LIABILITY AND SERVICE PROVISION Legislation now requires that, if a product has a fault, it must be recalled and the fault rectified (see sector 2 in Figure 17.1). Product recalls are exceedingly expensive and they damage the company’s image. The higher up the chart shown in Figure 17.3 we go, the more catastrophic a fault becomes. When you buy a packet of six ballpoint pens, it is no great tragedy if one doesn’t write properly. The probability ratio 1:6, in a Gaussian distribution, is one standard deviation or “1-sigma.” But would you fly in a plane designed<br>\n <br>\n 487<br>\n <br>\n 488<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 17:<br>\n <br>\n Forces for Change<br>\n <br>\n on a “1-sigma” basis? Safety-critical systems today are designed on a “6-sigma” reliability rating, meaning that the probability that the component or assembly will fail to meet specification is less than three parts in a million. This impacts the way materials are produced and processed. Reliability and reproducibility require sophisticated process control and that every aspect of their production is monitored and verified. Clean steels (steels with greatly reduced inclusion account), aluminum alloys with tight composition control, real-time feedback control of processing, new nondestructive testing for quality and integrity, and random sample testing all help ensure that quality is maintained. This pressure on manufacturers to assume full-life responsibility for their products causes them to consider taking maintenance and replacement out of the hands of the consumer and doing it themselves. In this way they can monitor product use and replace the product, taking back the original, not when it is worn out but when it is optimal to recondition and redeploy it. The producers no longer sell a product; they sell a service. In common with many others, my university does not own copying machines, though we have many. Instead it has a contract with a provider to guarantee a certain copying service—the provision of “copied pages per week,” you might call it. This changes the economic boundary conditions for the designer of the copier. The objective is no longer that of building copiers with the most features at the lowest price, but rather building ones that will, over the long term, provide copies at the lowest cost per page. The result: a priority to design for ease of replacement, reconditioning, and standardization of materials and components between models. The best copier is no longer the one that lasts the longest; it’s the one that is the cheapest for the maker to recondition, upgrade, or replace. This is not an isolated example. Aircraft engine makers now adopt a strategy of providing “power by the hour.” It is the same strategy that makers of copiers use: They own the engines, monitor their use, and replace them on the plane at the point at which the tradeoff between cost, reliability, and powerproviding capacity is optimal. Legislation exerts other forces for change. Manufacturers must now register the large number of restricted substances that are contained in the products they make or used in their manufacture. If the level of use exceeds a threshold, the material must be replaced. The list includes the metals cadmium, lead, and mercury, along with a large number of their compounds and chemicals, many of them used in material processing. So the restrictions exert forces for change both in material choice and in the way that the material is shaped, joined, and finished.<br>\n <br>\n 17.5 Miniaturization and Multifunctionality<br>\n <br>\n 17.5 MINIATURIZATION AND MULTIFUNCTIONALITY Today we make increasing use of precision mechanical engineering at the micron scale (see sector 3 in Figure 17.1). CD and DVD players require the ability to position the read-head with micron precision. Hard disk drives are yet more impressive: Think of storing and retrieving a gigabyte of information on a few square millimeters. MEMS (miniature electro-mechanical systems), now universal as the accelerometers that trigger automobile airbags, rely on micron-thick cantilever beams that bend under inertial forces in a (very) sudden stop. MEMS technology promises much more. There are now video projectors that work not by projecting light through an LCD screen but by reflecting it from arrays of electrostatically actuated mirrors, each a few microns across, allowing much higher light intensities. There are even studies of mechanical microprocessors using bi-stable mechanical switching that could compete with semiconductor switching for information processing. The smaller you make the components of a device, the greater the functionality you can pack into it. Think (as we already did in Section 8.6) of mobile phones, PDAs, MP3 players, and above all portable computers so small that they fit in a jacket pocket. All these involve components with mechanical functions: protection, positioning, actuation, sensing, casings, hard disks, keyboards, thermal and shock protection. Microengineering no longer means Swiss watches. It means almost all the devices with which we interact continuously throughout a working day. Miniaturization imposes new demands on materials. As devices become smaller, it is mechanical failures that become design-limiting. In the past the allowable size and weight of casings, connectors, keypads, motors, and actuators gave plenty of margin of safety on bending stiffness, strength, wear rates, and corrosion rates. But none of these scale linearly with size. If we measure scale by a characterizing length L, bending stiffness scales as L3 or L4, strength as L2 or L3, and wear and corrosion, if measured by fractional loss of section per unit time, scales as 1/L. Thus the smaller the device, the greater the demands placed on the materials of which it is made. That is the bad news. The better news is that, since the device is smaller, the amount of material needed to make it is less. Add to that the fact that consumers want small size with powerful functionality and will pay more for it. The result: Expensive, high-performance materials that would not merit consideration for bulky products become viable for this new, miniaturized generation. Think of the armature of an airbag actuator: it weighs about 1 mg, and 1 mg of almost any material—even gold—costs, in it raw state, very little.<br>\n <br>\n 489<br>\n <br>\n 490<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 17:<br>\n <br>\n Forces for Change<br>\n <br>\n So, it seems, material cost no longer limits choice. It is processing that imposes restrictions. Making micron-scale products with precision presents new processing challenges. The watchmakers of Switzerland perfected tools to meet their needs, but the digital watch decimated the mechanical watch business—their methods were not transferable to the new form of miniaturization, which requires mass production at low cost. The makers of microprocessors, on the other hand, had already coped with this sort of scaling-down in nonmechanical systems—their microfabrication methods, rather than those of the watchmaker, have been adapted to make micromachines. But adopting these methods means that the menu of materials is drastically curtailed. In their present form these processes can shape silicon, silicon oxides, nitride and carbide, thin films of copper and gold, but little else. The staple materials of large-scale engineering—carbon and alloy steels, aluminum alloys, polyolefins, glass—do not appear. The current challenge is to broaden the range of microfabrication processes to allow a wider choice of materials to be manipulated.<br>\n <br>\n 17.6 CONCERN FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR THE INDIVIDUAL We live in a carbon-burning economy. Energy from fossil fuels has given the developed countries high standards of living and made them wealthy. Other, much more populous countries aspire to the same standards of life and wealth and are well-advanced in acquiring them. Yet the time is approaching when burning hydrocarbons will no longer meet energy needs, and even if it could the burden it places on the natural environment will force limits to be set (see sector 4 in Figure 17.1). Short-term measures to address this and the implications these have for material selection were the subject of Chapter 15. The changes necessary to allow longer-term sustainable development will have to be much more far-reaching, changing the ways in which we manufacture, transport ourselves and our goods, and live, and having a major impact on the way materials, central to all of these, are used. It is one thing to point out that this force for change is a potent one, but quite another to predict what its consequences will be. It is possible to point to fuel-cell technology, energy from natural sources, and safe nuclear power (all with material challenges) as ways forward, but—in the sense we are discussing here—even these are short-term solutions. Remember the figure cited in the introduction to Chapter 15: At a global growth rate of 3% per year, we will mine, process, and dispose of more “stuff” in the next 25 years than in the entire industrial history of humans. The question that has no present answer is this: How can a world population growing at about 3% per year, living in countries with economic growth rates of between 2% and 20% per<br>\n <br>\n 17.6 Concern for the Environment and for the Individual<br>\n <br>\n year, continue to meet its aspirations with zero—or even negative—growth in consumption of energy and materials? Wealth has another dimension: It enables resources to be allocated to health care, for which there is a growing demand in a population with an increasing lifespan. A surprisingly large fraction of the organs in a human body perform predominantly mechanical functions: teeth for cutting and grinding, bone to support structural loads, joints to allow articulation, the heart to pump blood, and arteries to carry it under pressure to the extremities of the body, muscle to actuate, skin to provide flexible protection. Aging or accidental damage frequently causes one or more of these to malfunction. Because there are mechanical, it is possible, in principle, to replace them. One way to do so is to use real body parts, but the shear number of patients requiring such treatment and the ethical and other difficulties of using human replacements drives efforts to develop artificial substitutes. Man-made teeth and bone implants, hip and knee joint replacements, artificial artery and skin, even hearts, exist already and are widely used. But at present they are exceedingly expensive, limiting their availability, and for the most part they are only crude substitutes for the real thing. There is major incentive for change here, stimulating research into affordable materials for artificial organs of all types. Studies show that in a world that is aging the usability of many products and services is unnecessarily challenging to people, whether they are young or old, able-bodied or less able. Until recently the goal of many designers was to appeal to the youth market (meaning the 15–35 age group) as the mainstay of their business, thereby developing products that often could not be used by others. Astute manufacturers have perceived the problem and have sought to redesign their products and services to make them accessible to a wider clientele. The U.S. company OXO has seen sales of its Good Grips range of kitchen and garden tools grow by 50% year after year, and the U.K. supermarket Tesco has added thousands of Internet customers by getting rid of clever but confusing graphics on its website and instead making its services quick to download and the website simple and intuitive to navigate. In this way they include a wider spectrum of people in online shopping. There is a powerful business case for inclusive design—design to ensure that products and services address the needs of the widest possible audience. The social case is equally compelling—at present many people are denied use of electronic and other products because they are unable to understand how to use them or lack the motor skills to do so. All products exclude some users, sometimes deliberately—the childproof medication bottle for instance—but more usually the exclusion is unintended and unnecessary. Many services rely on the use of products for<br>\n <br>\n 491<br>\n <br>\n 492<br>\n <br>\n CHAPTER 17:<br>\n <br>\n Forces for Change<br>\n <br>\n their delivery, so unusable products deny people access to them too. Video recorders are the standing joke of poor usability, regularly derided in reviews. A much larger number of contemporary products exclude those with disability—limited sight, hearing, physical mobility or strength, or mental acuity. Countering design exclusion is a growing priority of government and is increasingly seen as important by product makers. This thinking influences material choice, changing the constraints and objectives for their selection. The use of materials that, through color or feel, communicate the function of a control, give good grip, insulate, or protect, become priorities.<br>\n <br>\n 17.7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Powerful forces drive the development of new and improved materials, encourage substitution, and modify the way in which materials are produced and used. Market forces and military prerogatives, historically the most influential, remain the strongest. The ingenuity of research scientists, too, drives change by revealing a remarkable spectrum of new materials with exciting possibilities, though the time it takes to develop and commercialize them is long: typically 15 years from laboratory to marketplace. Today additional new drivers influence material development and use. Increasing wealth creates markets for ever more sophisticated products. The trend to products that are smaller in size, lighter in weight, and have greater functionality makes increasing demands on the mechanical properties of the materials used to make them. Greater insistence on product reliability and safety, with the manufacturer held liable for failures or malfunctions, requires materials with consistently reproducible properties and processes that are tightly controlled. Concern for the impact of industrial growth on the natural environment introduces the new objective of selecting materials in such a way as to minimize that impact. And the perception that many products exclude users by their complexity and difficulty of use drives a reassessment of the way in which they are designed and the choice of materials to make them. The result is that products that were seen as optimal yesterday are no longer optimal today. There is always scope for reassessing designs and the choice of materials to implement them.<br>\n <br>\n 17.8 FURTHER READING Defence and aerospace materials and structures.

its precision and its completeness—in short, on its quality. One way of maintaining or enhancing its quality is to subject its contents to validating procedures. The property range checks and dimensionless correlations, described below, provide powerful tools for doing this. The same procedures fill a second function: providing estimates for missing data, essential when no direct measurements are available.<br>\n <br>\n Property ranges Each property of a given class of materials has a characteristic range. A convenient way of presenting the information is as a table in which a low (L) and a high (H) value are stored, identified by the material family and class. An example listing Young’s modulus, E, is shown in Table A.12, in which EL is the lower limit and EH the upper limit. All properties have characteristic ranges like these. The range becomes narrower if the classes are made more restrictive. For purposes of checking and estimation, described in a moment, it is helpful to break down the family of metals into classes of cast irons, steels, aluminum alloys, magnesium alloys, titanium alloys, copper alloys, and so on. Similar subdivisions for polymers (thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers) and for ceramics and<br>\n <br>\n Table A.12 Ranges of Young’s Modulus, E, for Broad Material Classes Material class All solids Classes of solid Metals: ferrous Metals: nonferrous Technical ceramics* Glasses Polymers: thermoplastic Polymers: thermosets Polymers: elastomers Polymeric foams Composites: metal-matrix Composites: polymer-matrix Woods: parallel to grain Woods: perpendicular to grain<br>\n <br>\n EL (GPa) 0.00001 70 4.6 91 47 0.1 2.5 0.0005 0.00001 81 2.5 1.8 0.1<br>\n <br>\n EH (GPa) 1,000 220 570 1,000 83 4.1 10 0.1 2 180 240 34 18<br>\n <br>\n * Technical ceramics are dense, monolithic ceramics such as SiC, Al2O3, ZrO2, and so on.<br>\n <br>\n Ways of Checking and Estimating Data<br>\n <br>\n glasses (engineering ceramics, whiteware, silicate glasses, minerals) increase resolution here also.<br>\n <br>\n Correlations between material properties Materials that are stiff have high melting points. Solids with low densities have high specific heats. Metals with high thermal conductivities have high electrical conductivities. These rules of thumb describe correlations between two or more material properties that can be expressed more quantitatively as limits for the values of dimensionless property groups. They take the form CL &lt; P1 P2 n &lt; CH<br>\n <br>\n (A.1)<br>\n <br>\n CL &lt; P1 P2 n P3 m &lt; CH<br>\n <br>\n (A.2)<br>\n <br>\n or<br>\n <br>\n (or larger groupings), where P1, P2, P3 are material properties, n and m are powers (usually −1, −1/2, +1/2, or +1), and C L and C H are dimensionless constants—the lower and upper limits between which the values of the property group lies. The correlations exert tight constraints on the data, giving the “patterns” of property envelopes that appear on the material selection charts. An example is the relationship between expansion coefficient, α (units: K−1), and the melting point, Tm (units: K) or, for amorphous materials, the glass temperature, Tg: C L ≤ α Tm ≤ C H<br>\n <br>\n (A.3a)<br>\n <br>\n CL ≤ α Tg ≤ CH<br>\n <br>\n (A.3b)<br>\n <br>\n a correlation with the form of Equation (A.1). Values for the dimensionless limits CL and CH for this group are listed in Table A.13 for a number of material classes. The values span a factor of 2 to 10 rather than the factor of 10 to 100 of the property ranges. There are many such correlations. They form the basis of a hierarchical scheme for data checking and estimating (one used in preparing the charts in this book), described next.<br>\n <br>\n Data checking Data checks proceed in three steps. Each datum is first associated with a material class or, at a higher level of checking, with a subclass. This identifies the values of the property range and correlation limits against which it will be checked. The datum is then compared with the range limits L and H for that class and property. If it lies within the range limits, it is accepted; if it does not, it is flagged for checking.<br>\n <br>\n 521<br>\n <br>\n 522<br>\n <br>\n Appendix A:<br>\n <br>\n Data for Engineering Materials<br>\n <br>\n Table A.13 Limits for the Groups αTm and αTg for Broad Material Classes Correlation* CL &lt; αTm&lt; CH All solids Classes of solid Metals: ferrous Metals: nonferrous Fine ceramics* Glasses Polymers: thermoplastic Polymers: thermosets Polymers: elastomers Polymeric foams Composites: metal-matrix Composites: polymer-matrix Woods: parallel to grain Woods: perpendicular to grain<br>\n <br>\n CL (× 10–3)<br>\n <br>\n CH (× 10–3)<br>\n <br>\n 0.1<br>\n <br>\n 56<br>\n <br>\n 13 2 6 0.3 18 11 35 16 10 0.1 2 6<br>\n <br>\n 27 21 24 3 35 41 56 37 20 10 4 17<br>\n <br>\n * For amorphous solids, the melting point, Tm , is replaced by the glass temperature, Tg.<br>\n <br>\n Why bother with such low-level stuff? Because it provides a sanity check. The commonest error in handbooks and other compilations of material or process properties is that of a value expressed in the wrong units or, for less obvious reasons, in error by one or more orders of magnitude (slipped decimal point, for instance). Range checks catch errors of this sort. If a demonstration of this is needed, it can be found by applying them to the contents of almost any standard reference data-book; none among those we have tried has passed without errors. In the third step, each of the dimensionless groups of properties like the group in Table A.13 is formed in turn, and compared with the range bracketed by the limits CL and CH. If the value lies within its correlation limits, it is accepted; if not, it is checked. Correlation checks are more discerning than range checks and catch subtler errors, allowing the quality of the data to be further enhanced.<br>\n <br>\n Data estimation The relationships have another, equally useful, function. There remain gaps in our knowledge of material properties. The fracture toughness of many materials has not yet been measured, nor has the electric breakdown potential; even moduli are not always known. The absence of a datum for a material would falsely eliminate it from a screening exercise that used that property, even though the material might be a viable candidate. This difficulty is avoided by<br>\n <br>\n Further Reading<br>\n <br>\n using the correlation and range limits to estimate a value for the missing datum, adding a flag to alert the user that it is an estimate. In estimating property values, the procedure used for checking is reversed: The dimensionless groups are used first because they are the more accurate. They can be surprisingly good. As an example, consider estimating the expansion coefficient, α, of polycarbonate from its glass temperature, Tg. Inverting Equation (A.3b) gives the estimation rule: CL C ≤ α≤ H Tg Tg<br>\n <br>\n (A.4)<br>\n <br>\n Inserting values of CL and CH from Table A.13, and the value Tg = 420 K for a particular sample of polycarbonate gives the mean estimate  α = 63 × 10−3 K−1<br>\n <br>\n (A.5)<br>\n <br>\n The reported value for polycarbonate is α = 54−62 × 10−3 K−1 The estimate is within 9% of the mean of the measured values, perfectly adequate for screening purposes. That it is an estimate must not be forgotten, however: If thermal expansion is crucial to the design, better data or direct measurements are essential. Only when the potential of the correlations is exhausted are the property ranges invoked. They provide a crude first estimate of the value of the missing property, far less accurate than the correlations but still useful in providing guide values for screening.<br>\n <br>\n FURTHER READING Ashby, M.F.
