Such problems was difficult to solve with classical techniques as FEM, FVM, FD, because the mesh requires severe modification at each time step. In the present lecture, an overview study for the mesh-free methods will be carried out. This study aims mainly to give the insight to this new branch of numerical methods which still have a lot to do. In this study, a new Radial Basis Function (RBF) is introduced since it developed by the author since 2005 and its results was good compared with other functions.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    3                \n        \n    We have new branch of numerical methods This branch, have the ability to solve: (1)A wide range of engineering, applied and industrial problems. (2)Ability to solve problems of large domain, which was impossible to solve in the past. For instance it became possible to simulate large- scale problems such as fluid flow around ships and aircrafts, meteorology, turbulence and wide range of computer intensive problems.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    4                \n        \n    WE ARE GOING TOPRESENT\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    5                \n        \n    (1)MOTIVATIONS Homogeneous and Inhomogeneous partial differential equations are of practical importance, and have a wide range of engineering and industrial applications. With the rapid development of computer technology, the research of the new discipline of engineering mathematics become easily to work and develop new ideas.

Among them are: (1)Kansa method (2)Hermite domain-type RBF collocation method (3)Method of fundamental solution (4)Boundary Knot method ......etc In fact, earlier than Kansa’s pioneer work Nardini and Brebbia in early 80’s without knowing the RBF terminology and existent developments, applied the RBF and the Dual Reciprocity Method to effectively eliminate domain integral in context of the boundary element technique.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    7                \n        \n    DUAL RECIPROCITY METHOD · DUAL RECIPROCITY METHOD Stage (1) The dual reciprocity method starts by introducing the following global interpolation form of the body force term b: Where: Interpolation coordinate functions between a point and any point x.

MULTIPLE RECIPROCITY METHOD At 1989 Nowak introduced what is called the Multiple reciprocity method. Since 1989 Nowak and Brebbia extended and generalized the Concepts of the MRM including Transient and Helmholtz problems. The method interducee a set of so-called higher order fundamental solutions and operates on the domain integral in a recurrent manner. Definition The multiple reciprocity method is technique, which is capable of transforming domain integrals resulting from the generalized body force to the equivalent boundary form.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    10                \n        \n    Let us start with the domain integral equation The superscript (0) has been included in the domain integral D as well as the fundamental solution and in generalized body force term b\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    11                \n        \n    PROCEDURE OF APPLYING MULTIPLE RECIPROCITY METHOD (1) The multiple reciprocity method starts from introducing the so-called fundamental solution of first order and the auxiliary flux. These functions are related to the standard fundamental solution by the formulae Provided these functions are known, the domain integral can be evaluated by making use of the reciprocity theorem :\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    12                \n        \n    For a known function of space, one can assume that its Laplacian can be derived analytically to obtain a new function, The application of equations (1)and (3) into the equation (2) Results in Where : is the flux analog defined as : The original domain integral has now been transformed into a boundary integral plus a new domain term defined as The procedure described above can be generalized in a natural way.

Mesh-free methods eliminate some or all of the traditional mesh-based view of the computational domain. A goal of mesh-free methods is to facilitate the simulation of increasingly demanding problems that require the ability to treat large deformations, advanced materials, complex geometry, nonlinear material behavior, discontinuities and singularities.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    19                \n        \n    NAMES OF MESH-FREE METHODS The names for the various mesh-free methods are still being debated.

There are many difficulties associated with FEM usage. As long as elements must be used, the problems will not easy to solve. The concept of element-free or mesh-free has been proposed, in which the domain of the problem is represented by a set of arbitrarily distributed nodes. In mesh-free methods; there is no need a priori any information about the relationship of the nodes.

These methods come in various flavors, most of which can be explained either by what is known in the literature as radial basis functions (RBFs), or in terms of the moving least squares (MLS) method. Over the past several years mesh-free approximation methods have found their way into many different application areas ranging from artificial intelligence, computer graphics, image processing and optimization to the numerical solution of all kinds of (partial) differential equations problems.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    26                \n        \n    Originally, the motivation for two of the most common basic mesh- free approximation methods (radial basis functions and moving least squares methods) came from applications in geodesy, geophysics, mapping, or meteorology. Later, applications were found in many areas such as in the numerical solution of PDEs, artificial intelligence, learning theory, neural networks, signal processing, sampling theory and optimization. It should be pointed out that (mesh-free) local regression methods have been used (independently) in statistics for more than 100 years.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    27                \n        \n    (1)Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) (2)Diffuse Element Method (DEM) (3)Element-Free Galerkin Method (EFGM) (4)Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM) (5)Natural Element Method (NEM) (6)Material Point Method (MPM) (7)Mesh-less Local Petrov Galerkin (MLPG) (8)Generalized finite difference method (GFDM) (9)Particle-in-Cell (PIC) (10)Moving Particle Finite Element Method (MPFEM) (11)Finite Cloud Method (FCM) (12)Boundary Node Method (BNM) (13)Boundary Cloud Method (BCM) (14)Method of Finite Spheres (MFS) (15)Moving Least Squares (MLS) (16)Partition of Unity Methods (POUM) AMONG BUT NOT ALL SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS METHODS\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    28                \n        \n    SOME OF SHAPE FUNCTIONS USED IN FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS finite element analysis The following graphs of shape functions are used to solve problems by finite element analysis.

Any function φ that satisfies the property φ(x)=φ(||x||) is a radial function. The norm is usually Euclidean distance. Radial basis functions are typically used to build up function approximations of the form. where the approximating function y(x) is represented as a sum of N radial basis functions, each associated with a different center c i, and weighted by an appropriate coefficient w i.

The associated initial and boundary conditions are as follow: In this example, two different cases for the control parameter, were done. In the first case we used two values of the control parameter when evaluating matrix coefficients. We took for all elements and took for elements, while in the second case we took constant value for, which practically corresponding to the average between the thin plate and the multi-quadraic functions.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    52                \n        \n    The comparison between the present method and the analytical solution is made as shown in Figure 1 at different times. It is clear from the graph that the error between the first case solution and the analytical solution at the same time step is small and can be neglected. Meanwhile, the error between the second case of the control parameter and the analytical solution is still small and can be improved by trying different values for the control parameter, or the shape parameter c or also by increasing the scattared points inside the domain.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    53                \n        \n    Figure 1: Results of example (2) at different times\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    54                \n        \n    CONCLUSION Thin plate and multi-quadraic meshless methods have been applied to a wide range of engineering problems, each method has advantages and disadvantages. When dealing with the multi-quadraic the main disadvantage is how to choose the shape parameter, c, specially some researchers found that it is a problem dependent while others found that by varying it the accuracy of the results improved. The multi-quadraic has the advantage that no singularities appear when computing the diagonal elements of the system of the linear equations obtained. On the other hand the thin plate has the advantage that there is no shape parameter, therefore, has no effect but it has the disadvantage of the singularity when evaluating the afro-mentioned diagonal elements. The present paper took the advantages of both methods and overcome the major disadvantages of them. Also the present method has what is called a control parameter which gives the facility of the researchers to try different values of and subsequently a major band of error analysis.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    55                \n        \n    TO WHERE WE ARE GOING TOWARDS ? Due to the advances progress in modeling and simulation of practical and industrial problems and due to rapid development of computer technologies, the need to quick and accurate numerical methods and results became the main direction of most research. I hope everyone interesting dealing with Numerical Analysis think a lot to start with this new branch of Numerical Analysis.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n         \n                \n                    56                \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n                                            \n\n                                    \n\n\n                                    \n\n                                        \n                                                    \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n\n                                        \n                                            Download ppt \"“ FROM MESH-FREE TO WHERE? ” Development and Progress S.

The multi-quadraic has the advantage that no singularities appear when computing the diagonal elements of the system of the linear equations obtained. On the other hand the thin plate has the advantage that there is no shape parameter, therefore, has no effect but it has the disadvantage of the singularity when evaluating the afro-mentioned diagonal elements.
