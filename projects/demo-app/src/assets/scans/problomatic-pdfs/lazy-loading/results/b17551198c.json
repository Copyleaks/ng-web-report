They are\nstatic, passive, and permanent, etc. What you are about\nto read, is my effort to augment physical materials with\ncharacteristics of digital information: dynamic, active,\nand programmable. The characteristics are embodied by\nthe capability of physical transformation. The new materials with such abilities could be used to construct a more\nresponsive living environment; accelerate the process of\ndesign and making; and enhance our existed interaction\nwith products or information, etc.\nUnder this vision, this thesis presents a combination of\ntwo intertwining research thread. The first one is a methodology framework of designing physical transformation\nby learning from the optimized way of how Mother Nature\nform and transforms living materials. The second looks at\ndifferent application scenarios in which transformable materials can be applied to support future human-computer\ninteraction (or human-material interaction).\nHopefully this thesis will inspire ideas, suggest new directions and guide the development towards a future where\natom and bits are truly integrated.\n15\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAs a negotiation between computation and physical\nmaterial, Tangible User Interface (TUI) leverages the metaphor of physical object and human bodily experience with\nphysical inert materials to build an intuitive experience\nwith digital information (Ishii, 2008). This is the core concept of “Tangible Bits”. Today, we are standing at a point\nwhere “Tangible Bits” is transforming into “Radical Atom”\n(Ishii, et al.). It is a vision that questions our fundamental\nexperience with physical material: What if inert materials\nbecome dynamic as pixels on the screen? How can such\nmaterials make sense to us?\nTo embody such concept, TUI expands it focus from passive to actively transformable materials. Such materials\nshould not only be able to change physical shape, but also\nother properties (color, stiffness, refractive index, etc.)\nThe transformation should be able to be controlled, programmed, and even synchronized with digital information.\nAt its core, Radical Atoms seeks integration, instead of\nnegotiation between bits and atoms.\nAs we pursuing the vision of Radical Atoms, we are encountering a new range of design problems: how do we\n17\n\nprototype such physical processes of transformation?\nPioneer works have been focusing on designing transformable machines using hard mechanics. They gave us\nan exciting preview of future human-material interaction.\nYet this approach of designing “machine” is limited by the\nsize, weight and energy consuming of actuators. How can\nwe scale the transformation up or down for different usage? Without scalability, Radical Atoms cannot truly reveal\nits potential in real-world application. How can we design\nmaterials that transforms? While designers have numerous techniques and tools to improve the appearance of\nobjects, similar method for creating ways to model material transformation are lacking.\nIf we want to depict a convincing picture of future Radical\nAtoms, we need to find an ecological way of designing\ntransformable materials that can creates numerous real\nworld applications. Proposed here is an alternative method of constructing future shape-change interfaces. This\napproach looks at how can we shift our attention from\nprogramming the actuator (force) to the structure (material). Rather than repetitively patching actuators (be it gear\nmotors or smart materials) on the material, then connecting them to a global controller, we should directly encode\ntransformation information into the inert materials. By\ngiving them different energy sources (forces), they should\naccomplish a reversible shape-change as encoded.\na\n\nb\nFigure 1. (a) The camouflage behavior of octopus. (b)\nA octopus changes the size of chromatophore cells to\nadjust the skin color .\n\n18\n\nIn the natural world, the phenomena of property-change\nare always conducted on the material level. Nature utilizes\nboth forces (internal or external) and material anisotropy\nto create amazing material transformation through space\nand time. Anisotropy means direction dependent. It is\nthe heterogeneous distribution of material. The octopus’\ncamouflage phenomenon is a result of adjusting the size\nof chromatophore cells on the skin; wooden veneer curves\ndirectionally based on the directional structure of its fiber\nwhen absorbing environmental humidity (Menges & Re-\n\nichert, 2012). Materials’ structural anisotropy play a significant role in those transformation processes. In this thesis, I propose that, if we are going to build materials that\nhave dramatic and scalable transformation, we should\nlearn from nature’s optimized way of building formation\nand transformation by leveraging material anisotropy. It\nis not about bio-mimicry design. Nature’s examples only\nprovide us a perspective. The material’s anisotropy can be\nalso encoded or programmed to archive complex transformation.\nHowever, programming materials anisotropy does not\nsuggest giving up on controlling the force. In this thesis, I\nalso draw a spectrum of deforming forces: computational,\nmanual, and environmental. The controllability/programmability decreases in such order. This is another parameter of designing Material Transformation. Together with\nprogrammable material anisotropy, I propose a design\nspace in which six types of transformation are described. I\nthen present a serial of physical shape-change primitives\nbased on the type of transformation, which evolve to three\nprototypes as real-world applications.\n\nAims\nThis thesis postulates that the ability to design, program\nand prototype the shape changing interfaces is becoming\nincreasingly important as the programmability is shifting\nfrom digital to physical world. The thesis aims to create\ndesign framework for programmable material transformation by examining the relation between material anisotropy and deforming forces. I aim to establish two main\nparameters of the framework:\n1. Deforming Forces\nComputational: External computationally controllable actuator connected to the interfaces causes their transforma19\n\ntion. Air pressure is selected the prototypes in this thesis.\nManual: Human body’s direct action upon the physical\ninterfaces causes their transformation. Such as bending,\npressing, pushing, etc.\nEnvironmental: Natural forces acting upon physical interfaces cause their deformation. Such as gravity, wind, etc.\n2. Programmable Material Anisotropy\nEncoded Stiffness Distribution: location, density and direction of material stiffness distribution can be designed and\nfabricated.\nDynamic Tunable Stiffness: a dynamic material stiffness\nchanging can be achieved by using jamming technique.\nBy pairing those parameters, I aim to show a wide design\nspace for material transformation.\n\nFigure 2. The Design Space of Material Tranformation for this thesis.\n\n20\n\nContribution\nThis thesis offers the following contributions:\n1. An integrated framework of designing shape-change interfaces. Material anisotropy should be added to the agenda of designing shape-change interfaces in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). It could help us build expressive\ntransformable objects more easily.\n2. A pneumatic actuation platform that allows material\nchange shape and stiffness.\n3. Application prototypes show how transformable material can be used in everyday life.\n4. Provide a material perspective for interface designer to\nplay with smart materials beyond shape-change. The old\n“patching” approach leaves designer little space for creation. By introducing programmable anisotropy, designers\ncould maximize the creativity with limited technology.\n\nThesis Outline\nthe following chapters describe the evolution of ideas in\nthis thesis:\nChapter 2: introduces a context and previous work on designing physical transformation. I distinguished Machine\nand Material Transformation and pointed out the interests\nshift from machine to material.\nChapter 3: gives a series of examples of how nature transform organism by encoding information in the material\nstructure. Nature weaves energy, material and information\ntogether to create complex transformation. Yet man-made\nshape-change interfaces tend to isolate them.\n21\n\nChapter 4: describes a pneumatic platform for designing\nmaterial transformation. a pneumatic system can be used\nto deform a soft body and change their stiffness.\nChapter 5: presents a design space with primitives of\ntransformable material. Sis types of Material Transformation are explained. The chapter also presents three of\nthose types with physical shape-change primitives.\nChapter 6: offers three application prototypes as an evaluation of the framework. They are HelighX, PLYABLES and\nJamBot.\nChapter 7: discusses how the programmbale anisotropy\ncan be extended beyond shape transformation. How can\ndesigners utilize it for other perspective of interface design, such as property-change, self-assembly, etc.\nChapter 8: concludes the thesis with a summary.\n\n22\n\nMachine to Material Transformation\n\nTo consider transformable materials in design practice\nfirst we need to establish a context of human controllable\nphysical transformation. Mark Weiser once envisioned:\n“The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday\nlife until they are indistinguishable from it.” (Weiser,\n1999) As human beings have been designing, building\nand improving machines that can transform by using hard\nmechanics (linkages, gears, etc.) since long, now we are\nstanding at a point, where materials that change shape\nare desired. For instance, instead of constructing sophisticated mechanical structure for foldable furniture, now\nimagine a piece of clay that actively changes its shape\nfrom one to another.\nAs it is radpidly developing, man-made technology is\nshifting from focusing on machine transformation to material transformation. Here, machine refers to human-scale\nmechanical structures that support transformation. Material refers to wood, fabric, polymer, etc that can deform\nunder certain stimuli. Certainly material transformation is\na result of material structure (atomic, molecular ) change.\nIn this chapter, I will go through several examples of phys23\n\nical transformation design to demonstrate the interests\nshfift from transformable machine to material. This shift\nhas also influenced the development of Shape Changing\nInterfaces in HCI.\nMythology of Shapeshifting\nFrom ancient Greek to ancient China, if we look back at human mythology and literature, it is not difficult to find the\norigin of human’s desire and fascination with transformable material. Although they are pure imagination of the\nphysical world, they depict scenarios of how human would\ninteract with those transformable matter.\n\nFigure 3. An illustration of Ruyi Jingu Bang and\nMonkey King\n\nOne of the most famous transformable objects is Ruyi Jingu Bang (Chinese: 如意金箍棒). It is magical staff wielded\nby the Monkey King Sun Wukong in the 16th-century classic Chinese novel <Journey to the West>. Anthony Yu translates the name simply as “The Compliant Golden-Hooped\nRod,” It is described as being made out of black iron, with\ngold bands on the ends. It has the ability to shrink to the\nsize of a needle, as Monkey King stores it in his ear when\nnot using it, and grow back to the size of staff as weapon.\n(Figure 3)\n\nTransformable Machine\nIn reality, human beings have been building kinetic machines in the context of transformable objects or architecture. The machines are usually constructed with homogenous materials. Through a set of mechanical principles\nthey can be assembled together to exhibit certain transformation ability.\nThe Expanding Geodesic Dome by Hoberman Associate,\nopens from a 1.5-meter cluster to a 6-meter structural\ndome when pulled open from its base. When deployed it\nhas the same shape and triangulated pattern as Buckminster Fuller’s static, geodesic dome. This movable lattice is\n24\n\nformed from the edges of the icosidodecahedron, a cross\nbetween the dodecahedron and the icosahedron. Under\nthe similar design principle, one can develop a ring, a\nsphere, even a curved surface that can expand or shrink.\n\nFigure 4. The Expanding Geodesic Dome by Hoberman Associate. 1991\n\nSimilarly, many designer have been developing transformable furniture to meet different need in domestic scenarios. The table and bench combination by Uwe Fischer and\nAchim Heine, can be extended and retracted by means\nof numerous folding grilles and is therefore variable in\nlength. The rollable tabletop is constructed like a rolling\nblind and adapts to these movement. It can be stored in\na crate-like container together with the grilles. This work\ninspired other future development oon transformable\nfurniture design.\n\nFigure 5. The table and bench combination by Uwe Fischer & Achim Heine, 1987\n\n25\n\nBeyond scaling the volume of physical objects, some\nartists interpret transformation as assembly and disassembly. Arthur Ganson’s famous kinetic sculpture “Cory’s\nYellow Chair” decomposes a wooden chair model into\nseveral pieces, which are connected to the ends of a large\nmechanical system. The gears in the system rotate to\nmove the wooden pieces away from each other. After a cycle they can be brought back together to form the original\nshape of the chair.\n\nFigure 6. Cory’s Yellow Chair by Arthur Ganson. 1997\n\nMax Dean, in collaboration with roboticist Raffaello D’andrea, created a robotic chair that can self assemble and\ndisassemble. It is not only a piece of technological work,\nbut also a design prototype that envisions how future furniture could be, and proposes a question of how we could\ninteract with such object. The Robotic Chair looks like a\ngeneric wooden chair. Unlike most chairs, however, this\none falls apart and puts itself back together. The Robotic\nChair is guided by an overhead vision system and controlled over a wireless network by an external computer.\nVarious algorithms govern the chair’s behavior, while the\nsoftware is structured in such a way that the system can\nlearn from its environment. The Chair keeps its controls\n26\n\nand technology hidden under a simple wooden veneer,\nmaking it high-tech in the most unassuming way.\n\nFigure 7. The robotic Chair by Max Dean & Raffaello D’andrea assembles and disassembles by itself. 2006\n\nMore recently, designers also look at mechanical systems\nwith high controllability that facilitate abstract physical\ntransformation. The kinetic sculpture by Art+Com is a commercial work for BMW. The sculpture uses 714 metal balls\nthat are individually suspended one barely visible string,\ncreating an seemingly weightless, amorphous mass. Each\nball lowers and retracts independently, which allows them\nto approximate different forms, from simulating water\nwave to construct the fluid surface of a car.\n\nFigure 8. The Kinetic Sculpture by Art+Com. 2008\n\n27\n\nProgrammable Matter & Claytronics\nArt works express our desires to a physical world that can\nbe rapidly transform. In the field of robotics, much effort\nhas been made to realize such desire. Programmable\nMatter (supported by DARPA and the Wyss Institute, Harvard) is a new concept for reconfigurable systems based\non self-folding or self-assembly. One example is the\nSelf-folding Sheet by MIT Distributed Robotics Lab (Figure\n9). These sheets are constructed from smart materials\nthat embed actuation, computation, communication, and\nsensing. Embedded actuators are used to self-assemble\nflat sheets into 3D robots with specified functionality.\n\nFigure 9. The Self-folding Sheet by Daniela Rus’ Distributed Robotics Lab, MIT. 2007. (a) A 4 by 4 units of self-folding sheet. (b) Folded into a\ntable. (c) Folded into a pinwheel.\n\nAnother example, the self-reproducing machines demonstrated here are essentially modular robots. Their modules\nhave electromagnets that selectively weaken and strengthen connections, determining where the structure breaks\nand joins. Each module is a 10cm cube, split into two\nhalves along the plane. One half of the cube can swivel\nrelative to the other half in increments of 120 degree, each\ntime cycling three faces of the cube. Connected cubes can\nboth form and change into arbitrary arrangements\nHowever, the challenges lie between Programmable Matter\n28\n\nand the reality are not only the high energy consuming for\nthe transformation, but also the physical limitation of the\nsize, weight and dimension of the electronic components\nas they need to be all “patched“ on the passive materials.\nThus so far the Programmable Matter remains difficult to\nscale up.\n\nFigure 10. Self-reproduction of a physical, three-dimensional 4-module robot. 2005 (a) A basic module and an illustration of its internal actuation mechanism; (b) Three snapshots from the first 10 seconds showing how a 4-module robot transforms as its modules swivel simultaneously.\n\nClaytronics, as an emerging vision, seeks to achieve higher freedom and precision of physical transformation by\nembedding miniature sensors, actuators and controllers\ninto a single unit. Just as computer screen is composed by\nnumerous pixels that change colors, Claytronics envisions\na world that is composed with numerous such physical\nunits. Each unit can sense where the others are, and\nchange its position correspondingly to form the desired\nmacro shape.\n\nShape-changing Interfaces\nDeeply influenced by the kinetic art and robotic field,\nrecent research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)\nlooks beyond static, rigid physical interfaces, and explores the rich transformability of input/output devices\n[12]. Shape-changing Interfaces is a vision that future\nphysical objects can be deformed and adapted to any\nnon-planar surface [29]. Enabled by different technology,\n29\n\nShape-changing interfaces investigate the dynamic interaction that derives from actively changing forms of interfaces.\n\nFigure 11. Recompose allows user to control the transformation of a surface by hand\ngestures. 2010\n\nFigure 12. inForm by Daniel Leithinger & Sean Follmer consists of 900 individually\ncontrollable pins that can lift up and down, MIT Media Lab, 2013\n\nRecompose (Figure 11) and inForm (Figure 12) look at how\n30\n\nwe could interact with 2.5D Shape display. Similar to the\nkinetic sculpture by Art+Com, Recompose and inForm have\na matrix of plastic pins that can lift up and down. User can\nuse gesture or direct manipulation to change the shape of\nthe surface. As the physical 2.5D model is synchronized\nwith its digital model, the surface actively deforms itself,\ntoo. However, like other robotic system, such interface\nrequires a large set of motor control, which limit its scalability.\n\nFigure 13. Shutter by Marcelo Coelho. MIT Media Lab, 2008\n\nShutters takes another approach of constructing shapechange by compositing Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) into\nsoft fabric. As one examples of his Thesis, Marcelo showed\nthe potential of using SMA as a substitute of gear motors\nto deform soft flexible material. As SMA has a smaller\ndimension than usual gear motor, it can be easily attached\non the surface that one wants to deform, and gives people\na perception of material transformation, instead of machine transformation.\nSimilarly, morePhone is a prototype of future cellphone\nthat bend its shape to give users a silent yet visual cue of\nan incoming phone call, text message or email\nA set of SMA is attached on a flexible display to archive\nthe bending. It shares the similar construction principle as\n31\n\nShutters.\n\nFigure 14. morePhone, Queen’s University Human Media Lab, 2013\n\nSmart Materials\nThe emerging interests on SMA bring our attention to the\ndeployment of Smart Materials in HCI. A smart material\nrefers to a highly engineered material that responds intelligently to their environment (Addington & Schodek, 2005).\nThe response can be mechanically or optically, etc. The\nfigure below lists out some of the current popular smart\nmaterials by comparing the relationship between input\nstimulus and output response.\n\nFigure 15. Stimulus-response matrix for selected materials, Modified from Textiles Future\n\nIn this thesis, we focus on the mechanical output, which\nallows material transformation. Recently, more and more\nresearches in HCI utilize smart materials to leverage input,\noutput, power storage and communication for interface\ndesign. As the project Shutters demonstrated, smart\n32\n\nmaterials shift our attention from machine to material\ntransformation, from hard to soft mechanics. Smart materials, like SMA, Ferro fluid, Electro-Active Polymer, enables\ninterface/product designers to think about physical transformation from material perspective.\nHowever, most current attempts to implement smart materials in interface/product design simply propose smart\nmaterials as replacement or substitutes for more conventional materials or actuators. Smart materials are typically\npatched atop an existing structural system. It still follows\na paradigm, in which actuators and actuated materials\nare separated, isolated. Take Shutters for example. If we\nchange the fabric to another soft material (e.g. rubber), its\ntopological transformation will stay the same (although\nthe degree of bending might vary based on the substrate’s\nYoung’s Modulus.)\nSuch patching strategy remains still repetitive assemblies\nand difficult to scale up as it is typically maintained by\nglobal control, just as modularized gear motor system. If\nwe want to construct complex three-dimensional transformation, this “patching” approach would result numerous\ncable attached on the material surface and high energy\nconsuming. It is difficult to demonstrate a real world application with that.\nSo the question I would like to propose is: Can we propose\nan alternative design approach to achieve more expressive material transformation that current modularized actuation system cannot easily do? Can we partially offload\nthe shape-change control from actuators (digital) to the\nmaterial itself (analogue)?\n\n33\n\nMaterial, Forces and Information\n“Above all we must remember that nothing that exists or\ncomes into being, lasts or passes, can be thought of as entirely isolated, entirely unadulterated. One thing is always\npermeated, accompanied, covered or enveloped by another. It produces effects and endures them.”\n\n— Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\nTransformation in Nature\nIt has been commonly agreed that Nature creates solution with maximal performance using minimal resources.\nNature’s inventions have been also inspiring human activities and inventions. Now let’s slow down the speed of\nchasing new enabling technologies of actuator, and look\nat how nature transforms things. In the natural world, the\nphenomena of shape-change are always conducted on the\nmaterial level. The octopus’ camouflage phenomenon is a\nresult of adjusting the size of chromatophore cells on the\nskin; wooden veneer curves directionally based on the directional structure of its fiber when absorbing environmental humidity [1]. Materials’ geometry and structure play a\nsignificant role in that transformation processes. However,\n35\n\nthey have been neglected in man-made shape-changing\ninterfaces.\nTake a close look at dry leaves. When leaves are alive,\nthey are all flat. After they dry out, the surface curves up in\ndifferent angle and degree to form varies shape. Where the\nleaf veins are thick, it stays flat; where veins are thin, the\nsurface bends. The end form is an equilibrium state after\nconstant negotiation between gravity and the distribution\nof veins. The leaf vein serves as a material constraint that\ncontributes to the end shape.\n\nFigure 16. Diagram of a transverse section through a tree trunk illustrating the\ndeformations that result when blocks of secondary xylem (wood) are taken out and\nallowed to try. the in situ geometry of each block of wood is shown by solid lines;\nthe bent outline of each block, once it is removed from its original location, is shown\nby dotted lines\n\nAnother example of the transformation of natural material is the wooden veneer and its hygroscopic behavior\n(Niklas, 1992). When a piece of wooden veneer is taken\n36\n\nout of the tree trunk and let to be dried, the veneer will\ncurves up to different direction due to its very fibrous\nstructure. Figure 16 shows the relation between deformation and fiber orientation. The property of directional\ndependency is termed as Anisotropy. It implies the ununiformed distribution of physical material that causes heterogeneous mechanical properties. As core of this thesis,\nI will discuss later how to design material anisotropy to\ncontrol its transformation.\n\nFigure 17. Diagram of a transverse section through a tree trunk illustrating the\nChrysochroa fulgidissima (the Japanese Jewel Beetle). (a) The elytra and the\nventral side of this beetle display bright and iridescent colors that show a strong\nangular dependence. (b) A multilayer stack with appropriate thicknesses and refractive index of the constituent films causes interference of light and strong spectral selectivity for the reflected color, scale bar 400 nm. Irregular deformations of\nthe multilayer - (c) optical micrograph, scale bar about 100 um, and (d) scanning\nelectron micrograph, scale bar 10 lm - assure scattering and the visibility of the\ncolor over a wide angular range. All pictures are taken from <Photonic Structures\nInspired by Nature>.\n\nNot only transformation, Nature constructs functionality through material structure and geometry. While pigment-based colors feature in the most abundant techniques used to create color stimuli in nature, the brightest\n37\n\nand most intense colors result from the interaction of light\nwith complex structures on the micro- and nanoscale. The\nshell of Japanese jewel beetle shows a remarkable metallic iridescence on its elytra1 and on its ventral side (Figure\n17a). a multilayer arrangement in the epicuticle layer of\nthe beetle shell is the responsible structure for the bright\niridescent colors.This layer structure is made up of 20\nalternating layers with refractive index n1 = 1.5 and n2 =\n1.7. Irregular structures on the surface of the beetle shell\n(Figure 17d) assure that the beetle’s strong color appears\nnot only in the direction of specular reflection but can also\nbe observed from other angles (Kolle, 2011).\nThrough the cases presented above, we can see that\nNature creates function and transformation by combining\npre-defined structure and passive force, instead of pre-defined force and passive structure. The heterogeneous\ndistribution of material (a pre-defined structure) gives us\nthe opportunity to shift the controllability from the environmental forces to the material construction.\n\nMaterial Computation\nArchitects have been learning from Nature to build responsive artifacts that leverage the heterogeneous material\nstructure. The emerging field of Material Computation in\nArchitecture explores how material properties; micro-scale\nstructures and behavior can now be seen as information\nthat can be processed (compute) (Ahlquist & Menges,\n2011). As active design generators, they can be calculated,\narranged, and fabricated to archive certain functionalities.\nCarpal Skin is a prototype for a protective glove to protect\nagainst Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, a medical condition\nin which the median nerve is compressed at the wrist,\nleading to numbness, muscle atrophy, and weakness\nin the hand. Carpal Skin is a process by which to map\n38\n\nthe pain-profile of a particular patient—its intensity and\nduration—and to distribute hard and soft materials to fit\nthe patient’s anatomical and physiological requirements,\nlimiting movement in a customized fashion. It is an example of designing material distribution to archive desired\nmaterial performance.\n\nFigure 18. Carpal Skin by Neri Oxman maps the pain distribution on human hands\nto the local thickness change of material.\n\nFigure 19. HygroScope is a prototype that changes permeability as environmental\nhumidity varies.\n\n39\n\nHygroScope explores a novel mode of responsive architecture based on the combination of material inherent\nbehavior. Inspired by the pinecone that opens and closes\nto release seed based on the humidity change, this work\nutilizes the directional instability of wood, as described\npreviously, in relation to moisture content is employed to\nconstruct a climate responsive architectural morphology.\nSuspended within a humidity controlled glass case the\nmodel opens and closes in response to climate changes\nwith no need for any technical equipment or energy.\n\nModel for Material Transformation\nThe journey to the Nature gives us an opportunity to reflect\nhow can we design and construct next generation shapechange interfaces with expressive transformation in an\necological way. Nature not only operates difference forces to deform materials (Just as we use motors or SMA to\nactuate interfaces), but also creates material structure to\nassist formation and transformation.\nWe can then define three factors that are essential for a\ntransformable system (machine or material).\nMaterial: The physical matter, soft or hard, that\nperforms the transformation.\nForces: The operation of energy, internal or external, that actuates the material.\nInformation: The instruction of how the transformation should be.\nThe abovementioned approach of design Machine Transformation can be conclude as a model below:\n\n40\n\nFigure 20.\n\nIf machine transformation looks at how encoded energy\ndistribution can actuate materials directly, material transformation focuses on how the transform information can\nbe offloaded to the material structure. As Nature encodes\nthe shape-change information in the material instead of\nforces, Similarly, We can either encode the Information in\nthe Force or Material to design next generation of transformable interfaces.\n\nFigure 21.\n\n41\n\nPneumatic Actuation Platform\n“The finest workers in stone are not copper or steel tools,\nbut the gentle touches of air and water working at their\nleisure with a liberal allowance of time.”\n\n\n— Henry David Thoreau\n\nThe previous chapter provides a conceptual model of\nconstructing transformable material. To embody such\nmodel, a serial of transformable primitives and designs\nwere made. This chapter serves as a technical support\nfor the design primitives and applications for the next\nchapters. It describes a pneumatic platform that allows\ndeforming a soft body and change stiffness of thin sheet\n(Ou, et al., 2014). Pneumatic actuation is chosen because\nair is a lightweight, compressible and environmentally\nbenign energy source. A Pneumatic platform comprises\nwith a combination of solenoid valves, a vacuuming and\nan inflation pump. They can be programmed to deform\nor change stiffness of a soft body. For this chapter basic\nconcept and principle of how pneumatic control for deformation and jamming will be explained. In the next chapter\nI will describe the fabrication of the soft body, in which we\ncan encode material distribution to archive desired transformation.\n43\n\nInspiring works\nSoft Robotics\nSoft robotics is an emerging domain that is dedicated\nto robots comprised of soft components including soft\nactuators, flexible sensor/circuits, and soft bodies. In\ncontrast to other techniques for shape change, such as\nspatial arrangement of actuated modules, self-foldable\nchains, self-foldable surfaces, soft robotics often focuses on pneumatic actuation of elastomeric channels and\nbladders. The elastomeric channels are designed in a way,\nso that when inflated, the soft body can perform a series\nof locomotion (Ilievski, Mazzeo, Shepherd, Chen, & Whitesides, 2011).\n\nFigure 22. Multigait Soft Robot, Harvard Whitesides Group, 2011. The locomotion\nis enabled by the air inflation and deflation.\n\nWhile a primary focus of soft robotics is the improvement\nof the robot’s performance and the exploration of the\nbio-inspired mechanism itself, there is a large space to\nintroduce soft robotic technology in constructing shape\nchanging interfaces. One design space is to explore not\n44\n\nonly isotropic, but also anisotropic deformation with\nsoft composite materials: an elastomer by itself deforms\nuniformly under stress; however, by compositing different\nstructural layers with various mechanical properties, the\norientation of deformation can be controlled. More detail\nwill be explained in the coming Chapter.\nTunable-Stiffness With Jamming\nStiffness-changing material and mechanism have been\nexplored in mechanical engineering to construct robotic\nmanipulators, such as medical robotics, gripping arms\n(Cheng. et al. 2012). Particle jamming has been explored\nrecently. Granular jamming system can switch from fluid\nstate to solid state when air pressure gets low. Externally\nactuated snake-like manipulators (i.e. those with actuators integrated into the structure) utilize this stiffness\nchanging mechanism to deform and lock to different\nshape states.\n\na\n\nb\nFigure 23. Stiffness tunable material enabled by jamming. (a) Particle jamming for\nrobotic gripper. (b) Layer jamming for robotic arm\n\n45\n\nHowever, particle jamming has unique disadvantage as\nit can only work in a relatively large volume system, thus\nit cannot be used to construct thin and light surface/\nwall with tunable stiffness. To solve this issue, layer jamming was developed very recently (Kim, Cheng, Kim, &\nIagnemma, 2012). Layered jamming system includes an\nairtight envelope with multiple thin layer jamming flaps\n(i.e. sketch paper) inside. It utilizes a negative air pressure to amplify the friction between each jamming layer.\nLayer jamming has been used to construct the wall of\nrobotic manipulators in hollow tubular shape, which can\nbe deformed and actuated to grasp objects. Orthoses and\nprotective equipment that can be shaped and fitted to the\nbody shape in an optimal way have been developed\n\nPrinciple of Layer-jamming\nLayer-jamming systems can be composed of an airtight\nenvelope with multiple thin layers of “flaps” (e.g., paper)\ninside. As with particle jamming, the system utilizes negative air pressure to vacuum-pack the thin layers of material\nto amplify the friction between each layer. As illustrated in\nFigure 2, where S, P, n and μ represent the overlapped surface area, the pressure applied on the surface, the number\nof layers present, and friction coefficient of the thin layers\nrespectively, the maximum resisting tensile force (F) can\nbe calculated as follows:\nF = μnPS.\n\nDepending on the direction of applied external loads, the\nflexural stiffness of the jamming layers can also be important. If the direction of an applied external force is not\nparallel with all the flaps, then the layered flaps can be\nsubjected to bending forces. That is the reason why even\nsheet materials with high friction coefficients do not nec46\n\nessarily result in a layer-jamming system with significant\nbending stiffness.\n\nFigure 24. Layer jamming effects are dependent on both maximum resisting tensile\nforce and compressive bending force\n\nControl system\nInflation for deformation\nTo deform a soft body, a large-sized stationary air compressor (Silent Aire Tech., Super Silent compressor 50)\nand a vacuum pump (Rocker Scientific, Oil-Free Pump\n300) were used for experiments. However, typical tethered\npneumatic systems with a stationary air compressor limits\nuse in portable applications. Therefore, we developed a\n\na\n\nb\n\nFigure 25. (a) Basic pneumatic circuit for single air bag; (b) Self-contained pneumatic system\n\nminiature pneumatic control system with small solenoid\n47\n\nvalves (SMC, Series S070), a pump used as both supply\nand vacuum (Koge Electronics, Series KPV), and lithium\npolymer battery (3.7V, 110mAh). The system indicates\nfeasibility of a further mobile application. The noise levels\nof the systems are 40dB and 72dB for the stationary air\ncompressor and the miniature pump used in the portable\nin the portable system, respectively (catalog value).\nVacuum for Jamming\nIn a jamming control system, air can be either vacuumed\nout of or pumped into the jamming envelope. A layer-jamming control circuit can be composed of two 3-port\nsolenoid valves and one air pump for a single jamming\nenvelope. For most of our tests and applications, we built\na portable control system composed of an Arduino mini\nPro, mini Arduino FET shield, SMC s070c-sdg-32 solenoid\nvalves and AIRPO mini D2028 air pump (Figure 6b). There\nare three modes to control the airflow in and out of the\nlayer-jamming envelope: exhaust, supply, and close.\nThe exhaust/supply is the mode to deflate/inflate an air\nbag, respectively. The close mode stops the airflow to\nmaintain the system at a certain air pressure and therefore\na degree of stiffness (Figure 26).\n\na\n\nb\n\nFigure 26. Layer-jamming control system: (a) Basic pneumatic circuit for single air\nbag; (b) Portable pneumatic system\n\n48\n\nFor the deformable furniture application, a large stationary vacuum pump instead of a small portable air pump\nis used, due to the large volume of air that needs to be\nremoved for the application. The stationary version of the\nlayer-jamming control system can achieve greater jamming\nand inflation speeds, as well as larger negative pressures\nwhen jamming. This is crucial since a higher jamming stiffness is desired for the furniture application.\n\n49\n\n50\n\nProposed Design Space\n\nProposed here is a framework of constructing future\nshape-change interfaces. This approach looks at how can\nwe shift our focus from programming the actuator (force)\nto the structure (material). Rather than repetitively patching actuators (be it gear motors or smart materials) on\nthe material, then connecting them to a global controller,\nwe could also directly encode transformation information\ninto the inert materials by controlling the material heterogeneous distribution. The approach of encoding transformation information in materials is called Programmable\nMaterial Anisotropy. By giving them different energy sources (forces), they should accomplish a reversible shapechange as programmed.\nAs demonstrated in Chapter 3, material’s anisotropy can\nbe utilized to archive complex transformation. However,\nprogramming materials anisotropy does not suggest giving\nup on programming the force. I also draw a spectrum of\ntransforming forces: computational, manual, and environmental. Their controllability/programmability decreases in\nsuch order. This is another parameter of designing Material Transformation. Together with programmable material\n51\n\nanisotropy, I outlined a design space in which materials’\ntransformation can be designed to meet different demands and applications.\nThis framework is both analytical and generative. Some of\nthe existing works can fit into it. I attempt to complete the\nwhole spectrum with either physical prototypes or design\nsketches. Hopefully it will server as an inspiration for new\ninventions for interfaces design.\n\nParameters\nDeforming Forces\n“The form of an object is a diagram of forces\n-- D’arcy Thompson”\nFrom stones eroded by the wind; to human hands shaping\nmaterials into products; to motor-controlled high-precision movement, all things change shape by the force that\nact upon it. A force shapes formation or transformation of\nphysical matter.\n\nFigure 27. The transformation of crustacean\ncarapaces through the deformation of a flexible\nCartesian coordiation\n\n52\n\nIn his book <On Growth and Forms>, D’arcy Thompson\ndefined the abstract mathematical systems which underlie\norganic structural form and their transformations. (Thompson, 1992) Thompson sought to define form through the\nunderstanding of how physical forces produced structure\nand pattern. The attempt was to devise the underlying set\nof geometric laws, which shape form in relation to external\nforce. Such force can be from external like wind, gravity or\nhuman intervention; or from internal like thermo, chemical\nforces. No doubt that force is a parameter of shape-change\nsystem. If we want to program transformation, we need to\nconsider the programmability of the deforming forces. Apparently, the environmental forces, such as wind or gravity\nare difficult to be controlled.\n\nThree types of deformation forces are introduced in this\nframework. They are\nComputational force: External computationally controllable\nactuator connected to the materials causes their deformation. Air pressure is selected in this thesis. It can be also\nhydraulic actuation or smart material such as SMA.\nManual force: Human body’s direct action upon the physical materials causes their deformation. Such as bending,\npressing, pushing, etc.\nEnvironmental force: Natural forces acting upon physical\nmaterials cause their deformation. Such as gravity, wind,\netc.\n\nFigure 28. Three types of deforming Forces for designing transformable interfaces.\n\nThe rationale of such categorization is the programmability: how easy we can embed instruction in such force.\nThe computational force can be precisely instructed as we\nprogramming in the microcontroller; Manual force can be\ncontrolled by our body, but not as precise as computationally control; The environmental force is the most difficult to\nbe influenced. However, we can still control the materials\ntransformation by programming material anisotropy. As\n53\n\nmentioned, not only forces shape the structure of natural\nmaterials, but also, together the structure of materials,\nthey can form unique transformation.\n\nProgrammable Material Anisotropy\n“The book of nature is written in characters of geometry\n--Galileo”\nAs Neri Oxman suggested (Oxman, 2010), Nature’s approach of creating maximum form diversity by using minimum resources is through material anisotropy. Nature\nutilizes material anisotropy to achieve expressive formation and transformation. Generally speaking, anisotropy\nis the property of being directionally dependent. It can be\ndefined as a difference of material’s physical properties\n(stiffness, refractive index, density, etc.), when measured\nalong different axis. It implies the ununiformed distribution of physical material that causes heterogeneous\nmechanical properties. As mentioned above, wood is a\nnaturally anisotropic material. Its properties vary widely\nwhen measured with the growth grain or against it. That is\nwhy when dried, they deform in different orientation.\nIn the field of Material Science and Engineering, the concept of anisotropy is tightly linked to a material’s microstructure defined by its grain growth patterns and fiber\norientation. However, beyond such scales anisotropy can\nbe utilized as a general design strategy for human-scale\nshape-change interfaces.\nIn this thesis, the material anisotropy is specified as the\nheterogeneous stiffness distribution, for the stiffness is\nmore relevant to the physical transformation. When external forces act upon the material, the stiffness of the\nmaterial defined the degree of deformation. The stiffer\nthe material is, the smaller the deformation is. If we can\n54\n\nencode the stiffness distribution across the material, a\ndesired transformation can be archive.\nTwo types of Programmable Material Anisotropy are defined here:\n1. Anisotropy in Space: Encoded Stiffness Distribution\nThe material has different stiffness across the region.\nFor example, the material can be wood or paper, and the\nnotches or indentations may be cut or engraved by a laser\ncutter to form a more flexible region. As “Programmable”\nindicated, three basic parameters of stiffness distribution\nare defined:\nLocation: controls where should deform;\nDensity: controls how much should deform;\nOrientation: controls the direction of deformation.\n\na\n\nb\n\nC\n\nFigure 29. Basic parameters of Programmable Material Anisotropy. (a) Location, (b)\nDensity, (c) Direction.\n\n2. Anisotropy in Time: Dynamic Tunable Stiffness\nUnlike static pre-defined stiffness distribution, material’s\noverall stiffness can be dynamically controlled via the\npneumatic system. This enables a dynamic transformation. As explained in the last chapter, the parameter that is\n55\n\ncrucial to the stiffness changing in time is the negative air\npressure in the jamming bag.\n\nDesign space\nOnce we have the parameters, we can now draw a design\nspace for material transformation. By matching the Deforming Forces and Programmable Material Anisotropy\ntogether, we have six different type transformations, which\ncan be programmed in different ways. They are:\ni. Pre-defined Stiffness distribution with Computational Deformation;\nii. Pre-defined Stiffness distribution with Manual\nDeformation;\niii. Pre-defined Stiffness distribution with Environmental Deformation;\niv. Dynamic Tunable Stiffness with Computational\nDeformation;\nv. Dynamic Tunable Stiffness with Manual Deformation;\nvi. Dynamic Tunable Stiffness with Environmental\nDeformation;\nSome of those transformations have been widely studied\nbefore or they have lower programmability. For example,\nPre-defined Stiffness distribution with Manual Deformation is about origami and foldable structure design, which\nhas been studied quite widely. Their transformations do\nnot response dynamically, neither.\nTherefore in this thesis, I will focus on type B, D, E. I will\n56\n\nalso leave the type F in the future work due to complexity of conducting real-world experiment. For each type, I\npresent series of transformation primitives to proof the\nconcept.\n\nFigure 30. A design space of transformable material for Shape Changing Interfaces.\n\nTransformation primitives\nType A\nDynamic Tunable Stiffness × Manual Deformation\nThis material primitive examines at how a tunable stiffness\nwould affect manual deformation of a thin sheet material.\nA tunable stiffness enables a dynamic material constraint\nwhen user manually deforms the interface. A user can\neasily change the shape of the interface when it is soft and\nquickly lock the shape by tune it to stiff.\nPrimitive A is a simple plan sheet with tunable stiffness.\n57\n\nIt contains 12 layers of 80-gram sketch paper. The figure\n31 shows that as the air pressure inside the jamming bag\ndrops, the sheet exhibits higher stiffness.\n\nFigure 31. Dynamic Tunable Stiffness with Manual Deformation. The stiffness of the sheet varies as the negative\nair pressure changes inside the airtight envelop.\n\nPrimitive B looks at a weaving structure of two jamming\nsheets can determine the bending orientation of the woven piece. We can weave multiple jamming units to modify\nthe stiffness of layer jamming. In the test, we design a\njamming unit, which has twelve layers of eight strips. By\ncross-weaving the two and applying different air pressures\non each, we can define the directional bending behavior.\nWhen only vacuuming the horizontal jamming unit, the\nwhole piece can be only bent up and down; when only vacuuming the vertical one, the whole piece can be only bent\nleft and right.\n\n58\n\nFigure 32. Two jamming bags woven together. It constrain the bending direction, up / down or left / right.\n\nAlternatively, we can also add the stiffness control to each\nstrip. Figure 33 shows a 5 by 5 weaving structure. Each\nstrip’s stiffness can be tuned individually. The weaving\nstructure enables a more free addressable control of surface stiffness.\n\nFigure 33. Five jamming bags woven together. Each one can be individual controlled.\n\nWe can envision that, with more sophisticated weaving\nstructures or higher resolution of stiffness control, tunable\nstiffness would allow more type of interaction with physical material be programmed or defined, such as the degree of rolling, the direction of stretching, etc. (Schumach59\n\ner, et al, 2010). Those interactions can be computationally\nenabled or constrained as the stiffness changes.\n\nFigure 34. Interactions with sheet shape material.\n\nFabrication\nAll primitives are fabricated with heat seal machine. As\nfigure 35 showed, two pieces of transparent vinyl were cut\ninto the identical size. One of them has an air connector\nattached on. We sealed first three sides of the two vinyl\npieces together. After that put the jammable materials in.\nThey can be sketch paper, fabrics, cardboard or sandpaper. A detailed performance comparison of those materials can be found in the appendix. Finally we sealed the\nlast side to create a completely airtight jamming unit.\n\n60\n\nFigure 35. The fabrication process of stiffness changing sheet\n\nType B\nPre-defined Stiffness distribution × Computational Deformation\nThese material primitives examine at how a pre-defined\nmaterial stiffness distribution would affect computational\ncontrolled deformation. Here, an elastomer by itself deforms uniformly under controllable air pressure; however,\nby compositing different structural layers, the orientation\nof deformation can be pre-defined.\nPrimitive C, This transformable primitive includes three\nlayers, a silicon layer with embedded airbags connected\nwith air channels, a paper layer with crease patterns, and\na thin silicon layer at the bottom to bond and protect the\npaper layer. While soft actuators have been introduced\nbefore, this one focuses on introducing paper composite\nwith various crease patterns to control the bending behavior. When inflated, the inner airbags function as actuators to generate elongation and force the surface to bend\ntowards the opposite direction.\n\nFigure 36. Structure of the composite\n\nIn this case, dynamic control of the curvature is deter61\n\nmined by two factors: air pressure and crease pattern.\nFirst, airpressure can control the degree of curvature. Our\nexperiments show how pumping additional air will make\na single bending turn into a curling with continuous bending. Secondly, the design of paper crease patterns will\naffect the deformation. As mentioned above, three parameters of crease patterns are defined in the experiments:\ndensity, location and direction. Figure 37 also indicates\nhow density affects the sharpness of bending. Lower\ndensity creases enable sharper bends and by varying the\nlocation of crease, we can control the bending location on\nthe surface. Laying out the crease lines diagonally generates helical shapes instead of curling on a single plane.\n\nFigure 37. The bending behavior changes as the lovation, density and direction of the crease pattern varies\n\nWood has been also test in this experiment. Figure 38\ndemonstrates a variation of on-surface pattern cuts on\nthin pieces of wood instead of paper. It shows similar\nbending and curling behaviors.\n\nFigure 38. Crease patterns on thin wood.\n\n62\n\nTo apply the aforementioned approaches of dynamic\ncontrol of shape changing states, we test how specifically\ndesigned crease patterns and respective control of airbags\ncan make a flat circular shape morph into different spatial\nstructures with three stands (Figure 39). We also show a\nprogressive transformation from a line to a square.\n\nFigure 39. Specifically designed crease patterns and respective control of airbags\nenabling dynamic transformation of shapes.\n\nIn Primitive D, the appearances of surface bumps are\ndetermined by air pressure and cut pattern. Elastic fabric (Spandex) was chosen due to its compliance under\nstress when composited with silicon. The difference in the\nYoung’s Modulus of fabric compared with silicon creates\nmulti-state deformation (Figure 40). We demonstrate that\nthe same surface will deform from macro to micro level as\nair pressure is increased (Figure 41).\n\na\n\nb\n\nFigure 40. (a) Structure of composite material. (b) Fabric constraints of deformation in local areas of surface.\n\nOne advantage of a fabric-elastomer composite is the ease\nof designing and fabricating different patterns. Rather\nthan making customized molds for textures, patterns can\nbe quickly designed and cut with digital fabrication meth63\n\nods, such as laser cutting. Figure 14 shows a variety of\ntexture patterns we have explored.\n\na\n\nb\nFigure 41. (a) As the increase of air pressure, the surface deform from global to local region. (b) Different textures\nare generated due to different cut patterns on the fabric composite layer.\n\nAlternatively, the surface of a multi-state shape change\nmay comprise more than three layers. For example, the\nsurface may comprise a “sandwich” of four elastic layers.\nA first central layer of the “sandwich” may be stiffer than\na second central layer of the “sandwich”, and both central\nlayers may be stiffer than the inner and outer layers of\nthe “sandwich”. Holes in the second central layer may be\nsurrounded by holes in the first central layer (when viewed\nfrom a perspective normal to the central layers). This\nfour-layer “sandwich” can produce at least three levels of\nbumps. For example, during an initial stage of inflation of\nthe multi-state inflatable device, the overall shape of the\ndisplay may have only a single bump. In a later stage of\ninflation, a second level of bumps may form on the initial single bump. During an even later stage of inflation,\na third level of bumps may form on the second level of\nbumps.\n64\n\nFigure 42. multiple “sandwich“ structure.\n\nFigure 43. Visualization of three-stages inflation.\n\nBeyond bending or surface texture, we can envision a basic syntax of shape-change (Rasmussen, et al., 2012) can\nbe achieved just by the encoded material constraints. We\ncan also envision that by combining syntax together, we\nmay be able to create a more complex transformation with\nless actuator.\n\nFigure 44. A syntax of shape changing.\n\n65\n\nFigure 45. Fabrication process\n\nFabrication\nThe fabrication process of these primitive are molding and\ncasting. The major soft body is molded and casted with\nSilicone Rubber ((EcoFlex 00-30, Smooth-on, Inc). All primitives are layered composite materials. In order to create\na nicely performed composite, we used oven to accelerate\nthe curing process of Silicone Rubber. After pouring the\nliquid Silicone Rubber in the mold, we put it in the oven\nfor 10 minutes. It becomes solid but still not completely\ncured. We can then put another half-cured piece on top of\nit to let them bond naturally in the oven for 2 hours. Since\npaper cannot bond with Silicone Rubber, we coated the\nwhole surface of the paper with the same type of Silicone\nRubber so that it can bond with the air bladder.\n\nFigure 46.Molding & casting for Primitive C\n\n66\n\nType C\nDynamic Tunable Stiffness × Computational Deformation\nAs I showed in Type B, A pre-defined structure can support\na two-stages shape-change. In this part, I exam a hypothesis with a sketch, that a tunable stiffness as a material\nconstraint could support a multi-stages shape-change.\nHere, a weaving structure of jamming is composite together with an airbag. By tuning the stiffness at certain\nregions, the surface can deform differently each time we\ninflate the airbag.\nThe Primitive E is to be implemented in the future work.\n\nFigure 49. Reversible multi-stages transformation.\n\n67\n\n68\n\nAPPLICATIONS AS EVALUATION\n“As structural, chemical and computational properties are\nintegrated at nano-, micro- and macro-scales, even the\nmost traditional material might become dynamic.\n\n\n— Ramia Mazé”\n\nNo technological exploration is complete without real\nworld application that can give form to abstract framework, push the limits of what is technically feasible today\nand how can it make send to people’s imagination. With\nthat in mind, I have developed three application prototypes: HelighX, PLYABLES, and JamBot. Each focuses on\none transformation type that I outlined in the previous\nchapter, respectively Pre-defined Stiffness distribution\nwith Computational Deformation and Dynamic Tunable\nStiffness with Manual Deformation. These application\nprototypes serve as the evaluation of the Material Transformation framework from last chapter, where I mentioned\nthat the framework could be used as a generative source\nto create real-world applications.\n69\n\nDesign Principles\nThere are two design principles in designing these two\napplications.\n1. Combining material anisotropy and computational control.\nMaterial constraints can be either pre-programmed stiffness distribution, and/or real-time tunable stiffness; computational control can be shape-changing actuation and/\nor stiffness-changing control. As a proof of the framework,\nthe application should demonstrate that by programming\nmaterial anisotropy, we could archive an expressive transformation that facilitates new type of interaction.\n2. Combining sensing capability and output in a form of\nproperties changing.\nAs an interface, it must be able to take input directly from\noutside world and response with its physical property\nchanging. As this thesis focuses on shape transformation,\nthe sensors are directly patched in/on the transformable\nmaterial. In the future, I will look at how to integrate sensing and actuation as a single material.\n\nHelighX: Shape-shifting Lamp\nDesign\nThis lamp supports large deformation from a straight strip\nshape to a rounded bulb shape. Users can pull the strip\nlike pulling the chain of a conventional lamp. The strip is\nthe illuminating light itself and it starts to curl and light\nup. This demonstrates Shape-changing combined with\noptical properties (Figure 50).\n\n70\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\ne\n\nf\n\ng\n\nFigure 50.

(d, e, f, g) Lamp in bulb state by curling.\n\nSensing\nSoft robotic engineers have shown how to construct elastic sensing surfaces by injecting conductive liquid metal\n(eGaIn) into inner channels of elastomer [1]. The resistance\nof liquid metal changes in response to the deformation of\nthe channels (Coelho, 2008).\n\n71\n\nFigure 51. The resistance of liquid metal sensor changes in response to the deformation of the elastomeric channels through pulling.\n\nWe adapt this sensing technique to fabricate the top layer\nof the composite material. It can sense surface deformation through both direct manipulation and air actuation.\nThese conductive channels can also be used for capacitive\nsensing to detect human touch.\nFabrication\nThe construction of the lamp is inspired by one type of\nshape changing primitives: the curling behavior under curvature change on surfaces. Silicon with embedded liquid\nmetal is fabricated as pulling sensor, which is attached to\nthe top of the lamp stip. Soft lithography is adapted for\nfabricating the shape-shifting lamp. Before the casting\nprocess, surface mounted LEDs are soldered on top of flexible copper strips. We then bond the copper strips with a\npaper substrate with angular cut patterns. The two layers,\npaper layer and air channel layer, are bonded together\nwith half cured silicon.\n\nFigure 52.

When users transform the flat sheet\n72\n\ninto the shape of a chair by creating two folds where the\nsensors are embedded, the system will automatically start\nthe jamming process after three seconds. Once jammed,\nthe carpet will become stiff enough to maintain the chair\nshape and support up to a load of up to 55 kilograms. The\ncarpet can be formed into other 3D shapes as well, such\nas a table board, or a free-formed lounge.\n\nFigure 53. Deformable Furniture: (a) Unwrapping a flexible carpet.

In order to\n73\n\nproof the concept, a serial of prototypes have been made.\nThe way to construct thin pressure and bending sensors\nwith off-the-shelf materials has been introduced. We\nconstruct our pressure sensor and bending sensor with\none layer of copper tape, one layer of 3M velostat, and\nanother layer of copper tape. As the sensor are pressed\nor bent, the copper tapes will make more contact with the\nvelostat. Thereby the electrical resistance between the\nthree layers will be reduced. This behavior allows us to\ndetect the amount of force applied on the sensor. In our\nmaterial samples, pressure sensors are constructed as\nround shapes and can be attached to any area that need\npressure detection (Figure 54a-c).\n\nFigure 55. Embedding sensors in the jamming units: (a-c) pressure; (d-f) Bending;\n(g-i) Mutual capacitance.\n\nBending sensors are constructed in rectangular shapes\nand can be attached to the hinges at which bending needs\nto be detected (Figure 54d-f). As a preliminary exploration,\nour current sensors have discrete sensing points. In the future, a more generic sensor network can be constructed as\n74\n\nwell. For example, instead of four pressure sensor points,\nthe entire layer can sense pressure at any given point.\nMutual capacitive sensing is also explored as an approach\nto detect proximity between two folding surfaces (Figure\n54g-i). Similar to bending sensors, we can also construct\na more complex sensing network to detect more complex\nshape deformation.\nFabrication\nWe use 25 layers of 800-grit sand paper as jamming flaps\nto build the entire jamming unit. Each flap has a dimension of 45 × 152 cm. The total thickness of the unit is 8.5\nmm. For the jamming envelop, we use a heat sealable 70\nDenier Nylon Taffeta fabric (rockywood.com). It is a nylon\nfabric, which has PVC laminate on one side, which provides the possibility to heat seal. The Nylon fabric provides nice visual aesthetic and smooth haptic sensation.\nThe sealing processing is similar to the primitives as described above. We added one layer of mesh fabric to help\nthe air flow evenly, as the jamming surface is much bigger\nthan the primitives.\n\nFigure 56. Flexible arm cast.\n\n75\n\nExtension of application\nBased on the similar fabrication process, we build another strip whose stiffness can be also dynamically tuned.\nThe strip has a dimension of 10 *120 cm. It is designed as\na reconfigurable rehabilitation cast. Patient can wrap it\naround neck, arm or leg when need. The strip can change\nits stiffness through time as the patient recovers.\n\nJamBot\nDesign\nTo demonstrate the potential of combining Dynamic tunable Stiffness and the computational controlled actuation,\nwe built a soft robotics that can change its stiffness. The\nrobot can crawl across the floor like other soft robot when\nit is soft. After jamming, its body stiffens to resist higher\npressure or load. For this prototype the jamBot can take\nabout 400 grams vertical load. (Figure 57)\n\nFigure 57. JamBot uses pneumatic actuation\n\nThe design of the jamBot is inspired by the deep-sea animal sea cucumber. It is an echinoderm that can change its\nskin stiffness to resist under water storm. We envision that\n76\n\nthe future stiffness-changing robot can be use for rescue\nin disaster.\n\nFigure 58. The robotics increases its stiffness to take more load\n\nFigure 59. The control and pneumatic circuit.\n\nSensing and motion control\nTwo electrodes are embedded on the back of the jamBot.\nThey can sense human’s touch as a trigger of stiffening.\nThe motion control system includes a jamming and an\ninflating system (see chapter 4). As current prototype is\nlimited by its own dimension, we did not attach the whole\ncontrol system on the soft body.\nFabrication\nThe jamBot has a dimension of 0.5 by 5 by 25 cm. It comprises with two layers: a jamming layer and an actuation\n77\n\nlayer. Two layers are glued together by common super\nglue. The jamming layer contains 18 layers of sand paper.\nThe ends of the sand papers were cut into a structure to\narchive high flexibility. The actuation layer includes two\nnon-flexible airbag. While inflated, the airbags behave like\nthe biceps (the muscle to pull the arm up), and compresses themselves to cause the jamming layer to bend. The\ninflation of non-elastic airbags happens on the same side\nas the surface bends towards (Figure 60). For more information about compression for bending, please refer the\npaper. (Yao, et al., 2013)\n\nFigure 60. Surface bending can be determined by the compression of airbags with low elasticity.\n\n78\n\nA STEP FORWARD...\n\nMorphing Vehicle\n\nFigure 61. The concept drawing of morphing wings\n\nIf we utilize Programmable Material Anisotropy as one\nparameter of designing future transformable object, we\nmight then be able to rethink some of the big (both scale\nand technical wise) design challenge in the real-world\napplications of transformable material. Morphing Wings\nhave been on the top list of future transformable objects.\nThe development of morphing wings can potentially enhance the aircraft maneuver. For example, the wing twist\ncould be adjusted throughout the entire flight in order to\nmaintain a shape giving optimal lift-drag ratio for maximum range. It could be also as a means of roll control.\n79\n\nIf we could utilize material with Dynamic Tunable Stiffness to construct the wings, we could possible leave the\nshape-change task to the environmental wind, let it form\nthe wings to a desired shape as we adjusting its stiffness.\nSimilarly, we could adopt this approach to design transformable car or sail. This is the Type F transformation that\ndescribed in chapter5.\n\nBeyond transformation\nPrevious chapters demonstrated that programming material anisotropy in space and time provides an alternative\nway of designing Material Transformation in the context of\nHCI. Yet the full potential interpretation of anisotropy as a\nmethod of controlling material organization remains still\nless explored for interface designer. In the field of Material\nScience, engineers find inspiration from natural anisotropy\nto design new smart material that can dynamically change\nproperties in response to manual deformation (figure\n62). It is therefore crucial for interface designers to adopt\nthe concept of designing anisotropy across scales to fully\ndiscover the potential of new actuators, smart materials or\nsensors.\n\nFigure 62. Material properties.\n\nThrough this thesis, I hope to inspire designer to look at\ninteraction design from a material perspective. As Neri\nOxman stated: “ anisotropy is without a doubt one of the\n80\n\nmost important properties for a designer operating at the\nheart of contemporary design culture. “ Beyond Material\nTransformation, what else can we do with Programmable\nMaterial Anisotropy?\nIllumination\nIn HCI, illumination is usually designed with electronic\ncomponents such as LED or light bulb. Inspired by the\nwork from Matthias Kohl, we could also design illumination change by designing dynamic material anisotropy\nchange. Another of my on-going project optiElastic looks\nat how can we fabricate multi-layer elastic optical waveguide with elastomers, which have different refractive\nindex. Such layered structure allows guiding a certain\nwavelength, red for example. When stretched, however, it\nguides another wavelength, green for example. The color\nchange needs no longer electronic I/O transducer, but just\nthe material’s structure change.\n\nFigure 63. Customized elastomeric waveguide with cladding.\n\nSensing\nAs interface designers are increasingly encountering new\ntype of sensors to build novel applications, how can one\ndesign with it beyond simply patching it? Again, we can\nlook at how the distribution of the sensor can be designed\n81\n\nin response to human input. For example, we can embed\na type of touch sensor on an elastomeric surface, so that\nwhen user stretch the surface, the gap between the sensors would change to facilitate another sensing modality\n(from swipe to precise touch).\n\na\n\nb\n\nFigure 64. Visualization of deformabale sensor. Sensing modality changes from (a)\nswiping to (b) accurate selecting.\n\nConstruction\nThe future of constructing physical world lies in the smarter material, not just smarter machines. If we could design\nmaterial parts with a programmed heterogonous structure,\nso that we could assemble them in a particular sequence,\nwe could create a macro-scale material that can perform\nself-assembly. Inspired by how DNA performs self-assembly in the cell, Skylar Tibbits provides an approach of\nembedding assembly information in the material. He designed material part based on the computer logic so that\nthen can self-assemble to a desired shape under a passive\nforce. (Tibbits, 2010)\n\nFigure 64. Digital simulation of Logic Matter self-assembling to a sphere.\n\n82\n\nNano-Actuator Distribution\nIt has been shown in earlier work (Chen, 2014) that the\nBacillus subtilis spore can be used to bend and release a\nthin sheet substrate, due to this spore’s hygromorphic behavior. Inspired by these results, we could also introduce\nthe anisotropy to the deposition of those nano actuators\nonto substrate geometries to achieve a wide variety of\nshape transformations. Orientation of spore deposition\ndefine the orientation of bending, position defines location of bending, and density defines degree of bending.\nBy combining different parameters, we can achieve finely\ntuned curvatures on thin strips and larger surfaces.\n\na\n\nb\n\nFigure 63. (a) SEM scanning of bacillus subtilis natto spores applied on a latex substrate. (b) Bacillus Subtilis\nNatto under microscope.\n\na\n\nb\nFigure 63. (a) Controlling the final bending curvature by depositing spores with different densities. (b) Bending\nin different orientations defined by the orientation of lines printed out of Bacillus spores.\n\n83\n\n84\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nPhysical transformation is by no mean new idea in HCI, but\nit remains largely unexplored due to its technical challenges and scalability. Inspired by how natural material changes shape based on its microstructure, this thesis takes a\nmaterial perspective on designing transformable interfaces. The structure of material and mechanical properties\nsuch as stiffness, can not only determine its static performances, but also, with the help of external forces, support\ndynamic shape change.\nBy introducing Programmable Material Anisotropy into the\ndesign process, the thesis aims to contribute an alternative way of prototyping shape-change interfaces, which\nexhibits expressive property-change, in an ecological and\nrapid way. We could partially offload the shape-changing\ncontrol from actuators (digital) to the material itself (analogue), to achieve more types of shape-change that current modularized actuation system cannot easily do.\nAs contribution, the thesis explores:\n1. An integrated framework of designing shapechange interfaces. Material anisotropy should be added\n85\n\nto the agenda of designing shape-change interfaces in\nHuman-Computer Interaction (HCI). It could help us build\nexpressive transformable objects more easily.\n2. A pneumatic actuation platform that allows material change shape and stiffness.\n3. Application prototypes show how transformable\nmaterial can be used in everyday life.\n4. Provide a material perspective for interface designer to play with smart materials beyond shape-change.\nThe old “patching” approach leaves designer little space\nfor creation. By introducing programmable anisotropy, designers could maximize the creativity with limited technology.\n\n86\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nJamming evaluation\nBased on the aforementioned calculation of layer jamming’s maximum resistance to tensile loads, stackinglayer materials with high friction coefficients can achieve\na higher stiffness while the system is jammed. However,\nsome materials, which have high friction coefficients,\ncannot achieve a considerable stiffness when jammed due\nto their own softness. Therefore the material selection is\nnot trivial anymore. For this paper, we have surveyed 32\ntypes of thin sheet materials (Figure 13) that are that are\nrelatively inexpensive, commercially available materials,\nand conducted bending torque comparison tests between\nnormal and jammed states to quantify a material’s stiffness change. The purpose of this test is to provide designers and researchers with an overview of what materials are\nsuitable for layer jamming and to compare and extrapolate\nrelevant and desirable properties (thickness and weight)\nfor different applications.\n87\n\nFigure 67. Samples of materials tested for layer jamming\n\nFigure 14 shows the test setup. A standard layer-jamming\ntest sample is 12 flaps of targeted materials (20cm by\n20cm) sealed in Vinyl-Pane clear plastic (Warp Bros). In\nthe test, we bend a test sample from 0° to 30°. The lever\narm is 15.2 cm. Based on the measured bending force,\nthe bending stiffness (jammed or unjammed state) of a\nsample can be roughly calculated as: torque = 0.152 × F ×\nsin30o, where F is the measured bending force.\n\nFigure 68. Test setup of jamming samples’ torque\n\nFigure 15 and 16 present examples of the normal and\njammed bending torque ratios of five types of materials\nas a function of weight and thickness, respectively. As\nindicated in figure 17, we have also tested the bending\nstiffness changes based on the change in air pressure in\n88\n\nthe jamming envelope in order to understand how the negative air pressure influences the jamming performance.\nThese graphscan be useful for designers to select jamming\nmaterials based on thickness and weight criteria.\n\nFigure 69.
