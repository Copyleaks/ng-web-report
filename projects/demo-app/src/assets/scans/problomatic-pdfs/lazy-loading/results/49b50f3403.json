It explores\nhow organisations simultaneously pursue the community development and the profitability\ngoals, therefore, combining the behaviour of the economic and the ethical actor. It features the\nGlobal Alliance for Banking on Values (GABV), an international network of 62 financial\ninstitutions and 16 strategic partners operating globally. Drawing from the existing theories of\nthe firm, this thesis discusses how the combination of the economic and the ethical goals\ncreates identity plurality in sustainable banks. It further examines the associated liabilities of\nidentity plurality and the ways they could be resolved by sustainable banks.\nThe existing theories of the firm provided insufficient insights on the ways\norganisations experience and resolve the challenges of identity plurality. Current research\ncontributes to the existing theories of the firm and helps synthesise the economic and the\nethical perspectives on the role of the firm. Sustainable banks combine the community\ndevelopment and the banking identities at their core and, as a result, face competing identity\ndemands. The identity plurality affects their organisational structures, processes and\nmeanings. Findings from this study show that sustainable banks face regulatory, governance,\nstakeholders relations project assessment challenges due to identity plurality.\nThrough a qualitative analysis of interviews, participant observations and documents,\nthis study discovered that challenges of identity plurality experienced by sustainable banks\nresult in two types of organisational liabilities: liabilities for multiple goals and liabilities to\nmultiple principle stakeholders. Sustainable banks address liabilities for multiple goals\nthrough a combination of identity work tactics, namely critiquing, contextualising and\nintervening. Sustainable banks further approach their liabilities to multiple principle\nstakeholders through the relational identity orientation expressed in such behaviours as\ninclusion of affected communities, full incorporation of local needs, philanthropic\ninclusiveness, transparency and power balance among stakeholders, governmental\ncommitments and collaborative hiring as well as socialisation.\nThis thesis extends current theoretical understandings of identity plurality as a\ncombination of the economic and the ethical goals within an organisation. It shows to which\nextent identity plurality is experienced by sustainable banks, what are the liabilities of\norganisational identity plurality and how sustainable banks resolve these liabilities. These\nfindings contribute to earlier conceptualisations of the hybrid identity organisation and the\nmultiple identities organisation and supports the development of the pluralistic identity\norganisation theory.\n\nvii\n\nviii\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nI would first like to thank my thesis advisor and mentor, Prof. Kenneth Amaeshi, who\ngave me an opportunity to pursue doctoral research at the University of Edinburgh Business\nSchool; who taught me that what is not surrounded by uncertainty, cannot be genuine and true;\nwho encouraged me to take risk in shaping my research as I question the preconceptions of\norganisational studies.

Liabilities\n\n1.1 Research Motivations\nOne of the most compelling reasons to study sustainable banking is the present\nunsustainable state of the global financial market. Organisations and institutions largely\nresponsible for the global financial crisis have not shown any considerable improvement of\ntheir practices or measures taken to prevent similar problems in the future. The existing\nproblems within the global financial market and their sources have encouraged the academic\ninterest in sustainability, ethics and corporate governance. Notwithstanding numerous positive\ndevelopments achieved in the past years and despite being visibly more sustainable than\nconventional financial institutions, sustainable banks remained largely neglected by modern\nfinancial rankings, legislators and oftentimes customers. Although these problems would be\ncommonly explained by the difference in scale between sustainable and conventional banks,\na change in the way sustainability is perceived and conceptualised can reduce the dominance\nof the “too-big-to-fail” organisations in the global financial market.\nIn addition to the sustainability agenda of regulators and market participants,\nsustainable banks have also been largely absent from the academic literature, despite their role\nin fostering sustainability in society. A small number of academic contributions focused on\nindividual features of sustainable finance and banking, such as investment structures (Brown,\n2006; Edery, 2006; Teasdale, Sunley & Pinch, 2012), the role of mainstream capital (Geobey\net al., 2012; Moore et al., 2012), the motivations of sustainable bankers (McWade, 2012) and\nthe ethics involved in sustainable finance (Buttle, 2007). In addition, the issue of micro-finance\nwas relatively thoroughly covered, however, more often being referred to as a case study\nwithin the identity, organisational forms or institutional logics theories (Battilana & Dorado,\n2010; Ebrahim et al., 2014). Another theoretical debate concerned the role of “philanthrocapitalism” (Bishop & Green, 2008; Edwards & Hulme, 2006). Moreover, practitioner\nliterature has covered some aspects of sustainable finance and banking, in particular related to\nthe subject of impact investing. Practical research has predominantly focused on the extent of\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1\n\ndemand for and availability of social capital (Freireich & Fulton, 2009; Wood, Thornley, &\nGrace). Overall, while some scholars have discussed the concepts of sustainable finance and\nbanking focusing separately on the environmental or the social aspects (Bouma, Jeucken &\nKlinkers, 2001; Cherneva, 2012), no comprehensive understanding of how organisations can\ncombine the community development and the banking goals has been developed (Nicholls et\nal., 2015). One refreshing exception was a volume by Weber and Remer (2011) that\nsummarised current understandings of social or sustainable banking and provided a thorough\noverview of the existing scholarship.\nOne could argue that scholarly engagement with sustainable finance has been troubled\nby the nascent nature of the field, which currently lacks clearly defined epistemological\nboundaries and institutional structures. Moreover, it could be claimed that sustainable finance\nlacks a normative narrative necessary to build legitimacy with scholars as a new phenomenon\nworthy of study (Kuhn, 1962; Suchman, 1995). Nonetheless, the sustainable banking\nmovement has faced multiple challenges and has offered multiple innovations in its attempts\nto combine the community development and the financial resilience goals and to avoid a\nmission drift, which currently remain under-explained by the theories of the firm. The\nmotivation for this study, therefore, was the scarcity of theoretical conceptualisations of\nsustainable banks’ experience in combining the ethical and the economic roles. An addition,\nthis research was driven by an academic curiosity to discover the best practices in resolving\nthe duality of the economic and the ethical roles of organisation that could be applied to\nimprove the current unsustainable state of the global financial market. Overall, the purpose of\nthis thesis is to address the existing research gap by positioning sustainable finance within the\ntheories of the firm and particularly within the debate on the economic and the ethical roles of\nthe organisation.\nSustainable finance organisations combine two organisational roles, which the\ntheories of the firm have long perceived as separate and oppositional: the economic and the\nethical. The ethical role of sustainable banks is guided by their mission to develop the\ncommunities in which they are embedded, while the economic role is based on the need to\nfulfil fiduciary obligations and ensure financial resilience of their products and services. The\nexisting theory has long feared that simultaneous pursuit of the economic and the ethical roles\nwould jeopardise the fundamental mission of supporting the community in favour of growing\nprofitability. This study, therefore, was inspired by the need to explore to which extent\nsustainable banks incorporate both roles and which challenges and liabilities are created by\nsuch goals duality.\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe existing theory on multiple organisational identities (Albert & Whetten, 1985;\nCorley, 2004; Fiol, 1991; Pratt & Foreman, 2000; Pratt & Kraatz, 2009; Sillince & Brown,\n2009) and hybrid organisational identities (Albert & Whetten, 1985; Battilana & Dorado,\n2010; Foreman & Whetten, 2002) highlighted some of the challenges that are likely to be faced\nby sustainable banks. Nonetheless, they provided little theoretical direction on synthesising\nthe economic and the ethical approaches to the role of the firm. Battilana (2018) further\nsuggested that empirical research on organisations inhabiting more than one identity remains\ncurrently under-explored and under-developed. The existing studies have discussed multiple\nfactors that affect the organisational behaviour towards its counterparts, including\norganisational purpose, stakeholder identification and salience, performance evaluation and\nboundaries between the organisation and its stakeholders (Margolis & Walsh, 2003).\nNevertheless, with the exception of Brickson (2005; 2007) little attention has been paid to the\nrole of identity in the way organisations perceive their role in society. This study was inspired\nby the opportunity to fill these theoretical gaps and explore how an organisation can\nsimultaneously behave as the economic and the ethical actor without causing a mission drift.\nMoreover, the researcher believed this study to be able to contribute to previous attempts to\nsynthesise the economic and the ethical perspectives on the role of the firm.\n\n1.2 Core Research Questions\nBased on the existing conceptualisations of sustainable banks as organisations that\ncombine the economic and the ethical view on the role of the firm, this study seeks to address\nthe overarching research question, “How do sustainable banks perceive and resolve the\nchallenges of organisational identity plurality?”. This research question pertains to the specific\ngoals, data and analysis in this study. More specifically, several related questions, associated\nwith the role that identity plays in bringing together the economic and the ethical roles of the\norganisation, were considered. These include: With the co-existence of the economic and the\nethical goals, to what extent do sustainable banks experience the identity plurality?; Which\nchallenges and liabilities does identity plurality create for sustainable banks?; and, How do\nsustainable banks as pluralistic identity organisations resolve these liabilities?. These\nquestions guided the empirical study within this thesis.\nThree empirical chapters of this study address the above listed research questions,\nwith each of them responding to the particular part of the overarching research question. The\nfirst empirical chapter (Ch. 5) focuses on the way sustainable banks experience the identity\nplurality and discusses the resulting challenges for their structures, processes and meanings.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nThe second empirical chapter (Ch. 6) explains how sustainable banks resolve their liabilities\nfor multiple goals created by the pluralistic organisational identity. Finally, the third empirical\npart of this thesis (Ch. 7) discusses how sustainable banks address their liabilities to multiple\nprinciple stakeholder groups stepping from the pluralistic organisational identity. Further in\nthis chapter a full overview of the organisation of the thesis, which was used to address the\nresearch questions, will be provided. But before that, the next sections will discuss the concept\nof sustainability, lay out a historical overview of sustainable finance and banking and present\nthe empirical case study of this thesis – the Global Alliance for Banking on Values (GABV).\n\n1.3 The Concept of Sustainability\nEven though sustainability is a relatively modern concept, sustainability-oriented\nthoughts and theories can be found in many religious and philosophical texts and teachings\nfocused on the ethical treatment of nature, people and society at large (Glaeser 1984).\nTraditional African and Polynesian religions, for instance, long promoted the ideas that finding\na balance in human relations with nature is the only way to achieve longevity and prosperity\n(Glaeser 1984; Mbiti, 1996). Expanding on the discussion of possible roots of the\nsustainability ideals, Kidd (1992) suggested that the modern sustainability movement has been\ninformed and inspired by six established sources, namely: the carrying capacity theory, the\nresource theory, the biosphere concept, the critique of technology discussion, the “no growth”\nor “slow growth” theory and the eco-development movement. Iy could be claimed that the\nfirst two influences identified by Kidd (1992) (the carrying capacity theory and the resource\ntheory) share multiple commonalities and could be summed up as the carrying capacity ideal.\nMoreover, the following four concepts (the biosphere concept, the critique of technology\ndiscussion, the “no growth” or “slow growth” theory and the eco-development movement)\ncollectively represent the normative ideal. Therefore, it could be argued that the modern\nsustainability movement was inspired by these two broad ideals and, therefore, would focus\non their main postulates and characteristic features.\nThe beginning of the carrying capacity approach, which has arguably dominated the\ndevelopment of the sustainability movement, could be attributed to the Malthus's foundational\n“Essay on the Principle of Population” (1798), which outlined the limits of the growth\npostulates based on the scarcity of resources (Kidd, 1992; Glaeser 1984). Malthus has been\nfollowed by other scholars including David Ricardo (1772-1823), who developed the concept\nof the limits to growth and discussed that human population and consequently the consumption\nare growing at a rate that exceeds the supply of natural resources (Kidd, 1992; Malthus, 1798).\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt should be noted that Malthus (1798) did no explicitly use the term “carrying capacity”, a\ncommon definition to which was provided by Riddell (1981), who explained it as “the\npopulation that can be sustained by an ecosystem.” Later scholars further extended these early\nclaims by theorising on the role of technology in balancing production and consumption,\nnonetheless, still concluding that despite the evident technological progress, currently rate of\npopulation growth continues to exceed the availability of resources (Kidd, 1992; Ordway Jr,\n1956). The carrying capacity approach has enriched sustainability studies with various growth\nmodels that benefit from strong scientific basis for capturing the sustainable development.\nSince 1905, however, the sustainability movement began experiencing the influence\nof certain normative claims. Shaler (1905) expressed an idea that each generation should\nresume a moral obligation for the sustainable development to future generations. This\npostulate later formed the basis for the modern sustainable development vision including the\ncommonly accepted definition provided by the Brundtland Report (discussed below). This\napproach was supported by other scholars, who discussed human responsibility for both the\nexcessive consumption and the degradation of natural resources (Kidd, 1992). Many of these\narguments were further developed under the global warming movement, extending the calls\non ethical responsibilities of the modern society to scientific arguments about the negative\nexternalities of the current economic order. Such angle inspired many scholars to question the\nvery notion of the “development” and explicitly focus on negative environmental impacts of\nhuman activity. Several studies suggested technological progress came along with multiple\nnegative externalities for the nature and the society. Around the same time, two foundational\nworks were presented: “Small is Beautiful” by Schumacher (1973) and “The Careless\nTechnology: Ecology and International Development” edited by Milton and Farvar (1972).\nOther scholars, including John Stuart Mill, focused on the “limits to growth” arguments and\nquestioned the ideal of growth in society (Kidd, 1992). These and some other normative\nnarratives had evident influence on the sustainable development movement and particularly\non its early conceptualisations in the “Blueprint for Survival” special edition of The Ecologist\njournal in January 1972.\nThe association with normative ideals inspired many scholars to discuss the notion of\nsustainability in a variety of contexts. Perceived as an ultimate ambition and an ideal state\n(Bell & Morse, 2008), the concept of sustainable development started to enclose more than\nmerely environmental goals, but also economic and social realms. Ignacy Sachs (1978) further\nsuggested that “values are an inherent element of sustainability” and presented the first\ncomprehensive view of sustainability and eco-development, suggesting that a working\napproach should consist of a combination of economic, social and environmental goals. The\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nauthor described eco-development as “an approach to development aimed at harmonising\nsocial and economic objectives with ecologically sound management, in a spirit of solidarity\nwith future generations” (Sachs, 1978: 113). The Brundtland Commission further developed\nSachs’s (1978) concept and coined the commonly accepted definition of the sustainable\ndevelopment as the one that “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability\nof future generations to meet their own needs” (Brundtland & W.C.E.D., 1987). The\nBrundtland definition offers a comprehensive vision for sustainability, including both the\nenvironmental and the socioeconomic realms and reflecting the preceding values-based\napproaches (Kidd, 1992; Glaeser 1984). Bell and Morse (2008) in their historical analysis\nextended previous knowledge by clarifying the relation between the two terms and claiming\nthat sustainability should be viewed as both a caption and a goal for sustainable development.\nDue to its emphasis on sustainability at the organisational level, this thesis adopts a\nsustainability definition by Dyllick and Hockerts (2002), who described it as “meeting the\nneeds of a firm’s direct and indirect stakeholders..., without compromising its ability to meet\nthe needs of future stakeholders as well” (2002:13).\nIt could be concluded that sustainability has become a critical perspective in managing\nfirms via a holistic approach by considering economic, environmental and social dimensions\nof firms. With the rising significance of sustainable development, the theories of sustainability\nin firms have evolved during the past decades. However, the existing theories of the firm made\ninsufficient contribution to the sustainability discourse, despite numerous calls to extend the\ndebate on the ethical and the economic roles of the firm and find a middle ground between the\ntwo perspectives.\n\n1.4 Historical Overview of Sustainable Finance\nSustainable finance has often been used synonymously with other constructs such as\nsocial finance, micro-finance, social funding, social enterprise lending and even social\nentrepreneurship. Some researchers (Lauesen, 2016) attributed such lack of conceptual clarity\nto a relatively nascent state of academic thinking on these loosely related concepts.\nNonetheless, even though theoretical framings might be nascent, the idea of creating\ncommunity benefit through commercial activities has a long-associated history of thought.\nNational state economies vary in the extent of their involvement in the provision of social\nbenefits, supporting environmental initiatives and regulating for-profit organisations. Thus,\nliberal market economies offer less extensive programs compared to welfare states because\nthe neoliberal philosophy proposes minimal market interference. Nevertheless, despite the\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nexisting differences in market economies and social welfare systems, social and environmental\nchallenges of the past decades have made evident a strong need for business involvement in\ndeveloping the communities in which they are embedded. These new challenged have also\ngiven start to a new approach of combining business and community development goals\nthrough the ideas of mutual benefit, unexplored market niche, increased customer loyalty and\nfinancial resilience. Stakeholders, both investors and beneficiaries, are also becoming\nincreasingly conscious about the business impact along the sustainability scale and increase\ntheir demand for corporate responsibility and involvement in community development\ninitiatives.\nSustainable finance and banking aim to achieve positive social and environmental\nimpact through the means of finance and banking (Weber & Duan, 2012). The idea of capital\ncreating both social and economic value traces back to faith-based and mutual finance\n\norganisations. Over the past few decades, a new type of organisations and financial\ninstruments has emerged to reflect institutional changes around the community development\ngoals and the purpose of finance (Emerson & Spitzer, 2007; Nicholls et al., 2015; Bishop &\nGreen, 2010). The sustainability component in sustainable finance includes capital allocated\nto projects and organisations delivering positive and endurable community impact, as well as\nsupport for social entrepreneurship projects that aim to generate positive community\nexternalities. Sustainable finance, therefore, stands for capital allocation for simultaneous\ncommunity (social and environmental) returns and financial gains. Such approach has been\nfeatured in the existing literature and practice as \"three-dimensional capital\" and \"blended\n\nvalue investing\" and refereed to \"capital allocated according to conventional, financial, risk\nand return criteria plus optimising a given social or environmental return\" (Nicholls et al.,\n2015: 3). However, sustainable finance spreads beyond a new set of investment opportunities\nfor investors in social or environmental projects. It could be perceived as a discourse around\nsuch capital returns, which requires new institutions of demand, supply and intermediation\n\n(Nicholls, 2008). Nicholls et al. (2015) further suggested that sustainable finance is both a new\nparadigm for creating community impact and a critique of the existing financial system that\ncreated a lot of social inequality and environmental problems. Sustainable finance represents\na new finance and investment approach capable of compensating for the shortcomings of\nconventional banking by putting community development goals at the heart of investments.\nTherefore, the new approach could both create value for local communities and limit negative\nconsequences of the conventional banking approach.\nThis chapter gives an overview of the history of sustainable finance and banking and\ndescribes the current landscape of sustainable finance. The overview starts with medieval\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nItaly, where the first banks in their modern understanding were established to facilitate\nmonetary exchange between capital providers and businesspeople in need of money to borrow.\nThese organisations became prototypes for modern community banks, credit cooperatives or\ncredit unions. The chapter further covers credit unions of the 19th century that set the\nfoundation for commercial lending. They were effectively supporting small businesses\nthrough financial intermediation based on strong ties to local communities, member economic\nparticipation and democratic member control. The discussion further features the first ethical\n\nbanks of the 1970s founded in response to political developments of the 1960s, such as the\napartheid regime in South Africa, and globally growing discussions of corporate responsibility\ntowards the society. These were the first attempt to re-evaluate the existing business practices\nand re-introduce ethics as an essential component of finance and banking. The chapter also\ndiscusses the first sustainability mutual funds and indices of the 1990s founded in an attempt\n\nto respond to new environmental regulations and incorporate increasing sustainability related\nfinancial risks, as well as to explore business opportunities brought up by the sustainable\ndevelopment trends. These financial products and services changed the landscape of finance\nand banking through re-integrating non-financial factors into investment and landing decisionmaking and product development. Following the Kyoto Protocol on climate change mitigation,\nthe financial sector saw increasing efforts to facilitate the reduction of carbon emissions\nthrough the means of financial intermediation. Finally, the chapter summarises the most recent\ndevelopments that could be perceived as milestones in the development of sustainable finance\nand banking. They were less concerned with establishing new types of financial products and\n\nservices and more focused on promoting industry level initiatives aimed at establishing social,\nenvironmental and governance problems as drivers of financial decision-making. The\ndevelopments discussed in this chapter include the United Nations Environmental Program\nFinancial Initiative (UNEP FI) that for the first time in history encouraged a non-polluting\nsector to make account of the environmental externalities. Moreover, the Global Reporting\n\nInitiative Financial Sector Supplement, the Equator Principles (EP) and the Principles for\nResponsible Investment (PRI) are discussed as important developments in standardisation of\nthe sustainability reporting. The Global Impact Investment Network (GIIN) and the Global\nAlliance for Banking on Values (GABV) are also featured to showcase successful stories of\nfostering sustainable development through the means of finance and banking.\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.4.1 Early Developments in Sustainable Finance and Banking\nThe history of banking could be traced back to ancient civilisations, where merchants\nlended and exchanged money for farmers and artisans. Similar practices emerged in China and\nIndia including early prototypes of money deposits. Banking in its modern sense originated\nfrom medieval Italy. Early banks emerged to connect people with money and those who\nneeded money to facilitate their trade, craft or farming. These prototypes of modern banks\n\noperated in local regions and had many common features with modern community credit\nunions. Similar to other commercial operations of that time, they were heavily impacted by\nreligious ethics, which served as the dominant framework for life and economy (de Clerck,\n2010). Religious ethics determined money lending principles and interest rates, which served\nto restrict usury. Thus, banks were expected to lend money only to those borrowers, who\n\nworked hard, had trustworthy reputation and were in good position to afford taking appropriate\nrisks (Milano, 2011). Moreover, reputable banks of that time were often dependant on\ndonations and charitable contributions, which also facilitated careful consideration of ethical\nstandards. Historical notes point to the example of a 16th century bank, Monte di Pieta, which\noperated under a strict set of such religious ethics inspired guidelines and principles (Ibid).\nThey included lending primarily to members of local community; measuring loans\nproportionally to the collateral provided by a borrower; selecting responsible borrowers;\nlending to local governments in times of need; supporting local communities; lending to\nwomen; paying interest on deposits; and providing treasury assistance to local community\nservices organisations (Weber, 2012). Monte di Pieta bank exemplifies the underlining ethical\nprinciples of banking operations in medieval Italy, which distinguished reputable banks from\nprivate lenders and so called \"loan sharks\". Due to their strong links to the Catholic Church,\nthese banks incorporated religious ethical and moral standards as an essential component of\ntheir financial operations.\n\n1.4.2 Cooperatives and Credit Unions\nCredit unions and cooperative banks emerged in late 18th century following the\nindustrial revolution in Europe and North-America and growth in middle and lower income\nclass populations. Thus, the first savings bank in the U.S. was founded in 1816 (Milano, 2011).\nCredit unions accumulated deposits and used member’s money to support community\ndevelopment, local enterprises and commercial initiatives. According to the World Council of\nCredit Unions, currently 85,000 credit unions exist operate globally and serve over 274 million\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nmembers in 118 countries. (World Council of Credit Unions, 2020). Beyond their core\nfunction of channelling money from depositors to borrowers, credit unions for the first time\nstarted contributing to developing financial literacy of their community members. This role,\nhistorically performed by many credit unions and cooperatives, has been gaining importance\nin the modern banking sector. Thus, in 2018 the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark\nCarney, commented on the importance of increasing financial literacy:\n“The Bank is working to de-mystify economics and make it accessible to\nyoung people across the country. A better understanding of basic economic\nconcepts can help young people make better personal financial choices,\nbroaden career interests and improve their understanding of the world around\nthem. Ultimately, a familiarity with economics broadens career options and\nwill promote greater diversity in business, finance and public service, and with\nit result in better decisions and more inclusive growth. We hope that teachers\nwill embrace the resources that their colleagues have helped create to educate\nand inspire young people across the UK.”\n(Bank of England, 2018).\nIn addition to credit unions of medieval times dedicated to serving urban communities,\nin rural areas cooperative banks were established around the same time to prevent usury and\n\nprovide deposit and credit services. Another difference from credit unions was insurance\nproducts developed by rural cooperative banks to serve local needs. Cooperatives are usually\nformed by individual members, each of whom is given one vote notwithstanding the value of\ntheir cooperative share. Organisational structure of both credit unions and cooperative banks\nwas based on community ties, solidarity and local cooperation. Many modern sustainable\nbanking practices, such as socially responsible investing, impact investing and green\nfinancing, developed through practices adopted from these mediaeval organisations.\n\n1.4.3 Modern Developments\nFollowing the époque of powerful cooperatives and credit unions, big transnational\nbanks started growing influence over the financial and banking industry. Their rise was\nsupported by the ideas that the success of large private corporations would translate into\nincreased benefits for the community as a whole, as well as the globalisation of the late\ntwenties’ century. These new developments in the financial sector caused substantial public\ncriticism regarding their business philosophy and approach, for instance, money laundering\npractices and doing business with oppressive dictatorial regimes (Weber, 2012). The sector\nwas also denounced for creating negative externalities for local communities as a result of\n\n10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nprioritising financial gains. On the backdrop of these trends, ethical banks came into sight at\nlate 1970s with an aim to re-establish connection between the financial sector and the real\neconomy. These organisations still account for a relatively small market share compared to\nconventional banks and credit unions, though it substantially grew in the aftermath of the\nfinancial crisis in 2008, which persuaded many customers to switch from conventional \"too\nbig to fail\" banks to cooperatives, credit unions and ethical banks.\nIn addition to ethical banks, impact investing appeared as another niche phenomenon\n\nwith growing significance in the financial sector. Aimed at making investments that bring\nabout positive measurable social and environmental impact alongside the financial return, the\npractice had substantial influence over conventional investment approaches. The concept was\ninspired by the blended return and shared value ideas, proposed by Porter and Kramer (2011:\n66), who described impact investing as: “...policies and operating practices that enhance the\n\ncompetitiveness of a company while simultaneously advancing the economic and social\nconditions in the communities in which it operates, Shared value creation focuses on\nidentifying and expanding the connections between societal and economic progress.” Unlike\nethical banking, impact investing ideas were acknowledged and implemented by both niche\nimpact investors and conventional financial institutions.\nHistorically, the first modern sustainable developments in the financial sector focused\non environmental risks and externalities of financial and banking activities. Responding to\nincreasing prices for energy, waste and emissions, financial organisations started working on\nenvironmental impact measurement and reporting systems to reduce their negative impact and\n\nconsequently their costs. Other motivating factors for environmental management included\nregulatory pressures and legitimacy and reputation risks. Moreover, some financial\norganisations worked to set a leading industry example to form a business case of reducing\nenergy use and emissions for their clients and partners.\nIn the 1980s, U.S. government introduced the Comprehensive Environmental\n\nResponse, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) to regulated corporate liabilities\nregarding contaminated sites. The goal of the program was to reduce health risks in the\nenvironment through a combination of clean-up, engineered controls and site restrictions.\nAround the same time, analogous regulations on soil and water usage and air pollution were\nintroduced in Europe. These regulations substantially changed the financial sector’s attitude\ntowards environmental factors and raised their significance as a credit risk. In attempts to\nmitigate these risks, banks started integrating environmental factors into credit risk analysis\nand management to improve the quality of their credit risk estimations. The United Nations\nConference on the Human Environment of 1972, the World Conservation Strategy developed\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nby the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and The\nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature (formed in 1980) were also among the first\ndevelopments of the modern sustainability movement. These events signified the realisation\nof the need for global coordinated effort in spreading awareness of the sustainable\ndevelopment goals, as well as current and future challenges. Further, in 1974 James Lovelock\nand Lynn Margulis proposed the Gaia Hypothesis, which gave start to numerous ideas around\nthe main thesis whether our planet could regulate itself and what would be the consequences\n\nof human activity. The authors also suggested that growing externalities from environmental\npollution, depletion of natural resources and biodiversity and greenhouse gases emissions\nshould be recognised as the devastating impact of human activity and wealth creation. Soon\nafter that, the Brundtland Commission was established with the purpose to create a shared\nunderstanding of the sustainable development goals and coordinate global effort towards the\n\nsustainable development. The new vector of development was set to find pathways capable of\nbenefiting both the industrialised and the developing countries and delivering both wealth\ncreation and community welfare.\nIn 1999, the UN formed the Global Compact non-binding pact and the OECD\nintroduced the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises to shape intergovernmental\nunderstanding of the principles of sustainable business conduct (Lauesen, 2016). The UN\nGlobal Compact pact was designed to guide organisations worldwide to adopt sustainable\nbusiness practices and included advice on human rights, labour policies, environmental\nresponsibilities and anti-corruption stance. Existing research suggested that evidence from the\n\nimplementation of these guidelines has been mixed, and many organisations have shown\nengagement primarily for reputation purposes. Despite this critique, the rising awareness of\nsustainable finance issues has led to new developments within micro-finance, social\nentrepreneurship and businesses that have seen the potential to work with sustainability.\nThe next step following management of environmental risks became entrepreneurial\n\napproach to environmental and social issues, which investors started seeing as opportunities\nto develop new products and services that advance community development. In 1996,\nSchmidheiny and Zorraquin published a book \"Financing Change\" proposing the ways\nfinancial sector could support sustainable development through financial products and\nservices. Environmental, sustainable and socially responsible investment products and\nservices began spreading across the financial sector. The Dow Jones Sustainability Index, a\nglobal index which tracks stock performance of the world largest companies in terms of\neconomic, environmental and social criteria, was developed and mutual funds incorporating\nsocially responsible investing principles were issued. Following these innovations, other\n\n12\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsustainability indexes, such as DJSI and FTSE4Good were introduced to the global financial\nsector. Socially responsible investing practises also kept growing forcing the majority of banks\nto start offering some sort of socially responsible, ethical or environmental mutual fund\nproducts. The largest SRI funds currently manage assets over USD 1 billion. Thus, Parnassus\nEndeavor and Parnassus Mid-Cap, founded in 1984, has annual investment returns of an\naverage of 14 percent and Vanguard FTSE Social Index averages 12 percent returns.\nAnother significant milestone in the sustainable finance development was the Kyoto\n\nProtocol of 1997, which forced the financial sector to account for CO2 emission trading and\ncarbon offsets. Financial organisations started investing in Clean Development Mechanism\n(CDM) or Joint Implementation (JI) projects based on the Flexible Mechanisms defined in the\nKyoto Protocol. Refinitiv analysts estimated the market value of carbon trades in 2019 as EUR\n194 billion and predicted that the trading volume will keep growing. Modern financial market\n\noffers loans or investments in JI or CDM projects, trading and brokerage of CO2 emission\ncertificates, CO2 funds, options and derivatives. However, future directions for carbon related\nproducts and services will need further investigation after the phase-out of the Kyoto Protocol\nin the near future.\n\n1.4.4 Impact of the 2008 Financial Crisis\nExisting literature compared the scale of negative impacts of the latest financial crisis\nwith the one of the Great Depression of the 1930s. It further regarded the global financial crisis\nof 2008 as a turning point for introducing new policies for financial sector organisations with\n\nthe goal to support the recovery of the global economy and avoid further recessions. The crisis\nhas made evident the unsustainable nature of large financial institutions such as Lehman\nBrothers, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Whereas these\norganisations no longer exist in their former realm, others, namely Goldman Sachs, Morgan\nStanley and Citi group have survived the financial collapse and have since shown little\nimprovement in their practices and general approach (Hellwig, 2009; Lauesen, 2013).\nThe story about the 2008 financial crisis began in the 1990s with large investment\ncompanies and banks inventing a way to spread risks from loans they were providing\n(Lauesen, 2013). The agricultural sector had long benefitted from spreading risks of bad\n\nharvests by planting a variety of different seeds on one field with the expectation that some\nseeds will deliver better harvest than others will. JP Morgan was a pioneer in adapting this\nidea to the financial sector and binding together high-risk and low-risk loans in a new product\ncalled Credit Default Swaps (CDS) (Lauesen, 2013). The product seemed sound during the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\ntimes of growth and conditional to trustworthy evaluations of the CDSs. JP Morgan could not\nhave possibly foreseen the market volatility that their initial idea would create in the future.\nSoon after the release of the product, other banks and investment companies introduced similar\nswaps with a higher risk or leverage ratios supported by fewer low-risk products that could\nbalance them out, such as Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), Asset-Backed Securities\n(ABS) and Collateralised Debt Obligations (CDO) (Lauesen, 2013; Hellwig, 2009). This\ndevelopment in the U.S. financial market quickly spread to other national markets (Vives,\n\n2001). In the EU large investment banks including the German IKB Bank, Swiss Credit Suisse\nand others began to sell more or less aggressively subprime mortgage derivatives and\ncontinued until the collapse of the shadow banking system, which first happened in the late\n2007 in the U.S. and then later in 2008 across the rest of the world (Lauesen, 2013).\nFinancial authorities, including the OECD and the UN, received criticism for their\n\n“soft” policies being ineffective in preventing opportunistic behaviours and financial\nspeculation (Lauesen, 2013). Hence, the OECD founded the Global Forum on Responsible\nBusiness Conduct to support the implementation of their Guidelines for Multinational\nEnterprises and the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, which were\nintroduced in 2011. Both documents aimed to raise awareness of the risks of opportunistic\napproach, responsible business conduct principles and the roles of different actors in\npromoting ethical standards. In 2014, the OECD held a conference in Paris to support the\ninitiatives to improve the current business climate and discuss ways to increase the financial\nresilience of the global financial market through corporate responsibility, accountability and\n\ntransparency with a specific focus on the problems of improving organisational governance\nand restoring public trust within the financial sector. The OECD Global Forum emphasised\nthe focus on creating long-term value within the financial sector and suggested that it could be\nsecured through “regulation, standardisation, and internalisation of external costs” (Lauesen,\n2016).\n\n1.4.5 Micro-finance\nTogether with the historical developments in the conventional banking sector, microfinance practices were emerging within the non-profit organisations. Micro-finance was\n\ninspired and promoted by the Nobel Peace Prize awardee Muhammad Yunus, the founder of\nGrameen Bank. The Grameen Bank of Bangladesh pioneered the idea of micro-credit and gave\nrise to the micro-finance institutions. Micro-credit aims to serve people who currently have\nlimited access to banking products and services and to eliminate poverty. It was initially\n\n14\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nintroduced as a way to help people finance their lives with our relying on donations and\ncharitable contributions.\nMicro-finance market has been growing substantially in the past decades and has\nbecome an important part of sustainable development activities. To further motivate its\ngrowth, the aim to reduce poverty by half until 2015 was reflected in the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. Nonetheless, even though micro-finance has been often referred to as\neffective and credible vehicle of promoting entrepreneurship in rural areas and supporting\n\ncategories of customers underserved by the conventional banks, previous research discovered\nthat annual interest rates charged by some of these organisations could reach from 30 percent\nto 70 percent (Gonzales, 2011). The astonishing discrepancy with the favourable mortgage\ninterest rates in the western countries has been explained by the amount of risk attached to\nserving the poor. The 2008 financial crisis had substantial impact on micro-finance\n\ninstitutions, including “saturated market for micro-finance, deficient credit policies, deficient\ngovernance structures, negative policy interventions and poor adaptability to dealing with\ncrises ultimately” (Ibid:7-8). Interestingly, the developing countries in Eastern Europe and\nCentral Asia (ECA), as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) suffered the most\nfrom the recession, whereas micro-finance organisations in the South Asia had limited\nnegative consequences for their banking models (Lauesen, 2016)\n\n1.4.6 Sustainability Initiatives and Associations\nIn the recent decades, several major sustainability initiatives and guidelines were\n\ndevelop in an attempt to incorporate environmental and social issues back into the financial\nsector. They signified substantial developments and new innovative approaches to modifying\nconventional finance and banking.\nThe United Nations Environmental Program Financial Initiative (UNEP FI) was\nlaunched in 1992 following the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and currently has over 300\nmembers and 100 supporting institutions. Connecting banks, insurers and investors, it aims to\ninspire, initiate and enable financial sector organisations to make positive impact on the\ncommunities in which they are embedded. UNEP FI has developed several frameworks and\nguidelines for sustainable finance, banking and insurance to support its signatories in their\n\nattempts to contribute to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Paris\nAgreement on Climate Change. In addition, it promotes research on sustainable finance and\nfacilitates environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues integration into investment and\nbanking through emphasising their complementary nature to financial performance. UNEP FI\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nalso supports the Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative (SSEI) established in 2012 with the\nsupport of UNCTAD, UN Global Compact and the PRI. It works to build a global network for\nknowledge and best practice exchange and provide space for informed discussions with\npolicymakers and regulators on the role of the financial sector in promoting sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) was first introduced in 1997 and was a product\nof cooperation between the U.S. non-profit organisations Ceres (formerly the Coalition for\n\nEnvironmentally Responsible Economies) and Tellus Institute and the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP). It presented the first draft of the Sustainability Reporting\nGuidelines in 1999, and currently operates as a collaborating centre of UNEP and the United\nNations Global Compact. The GRI aims to help organisations and financial sector stakeholders\nunderstand and account for their impact on sustainability issues, such as climate change,\n\nhuman rights, governance and development. It facilitates corporate action to create social,\nenvironmental and economic benefits for local communities. The GRI was the first\norganisation to develop comprehensive global standards for sustainability reporting, which\ncontrary to earlier reporting frameworks offer a modular structure easy to implement and\nmoderate. Moreover, it offers sector specific guidelines and ensures higher transparency on\nenvironmental and social performance of financial sector organisations. According to the\nKPMG Survey of Corporate Responsibility Reporting (2017), over 93% of the world’s largest\n250 corporations reported on their sustainability performance using GRI guidelines.\nThe Equator Principles (EP) were launched in June 2003 and by 2012 were adopted\n\nby 76 financial sector organisations. It is a risk management framework used to determine,\nevaluate and respond to environmental and social risks in projects, promote responsible\ndecision-making and avoid unintended negative externalities. EP consists of ten principles\ninspired by the environmental assessment principles of the World Bank and the International\nFinance Corporation (IFC). Currently the EP have been adopted by 105 financial\n\norganisations in 38 countries, covering a large part of global project finance debt within\ndeveloped and emerging markets. Even though NGOs have expressed certain concerns over\nthe EP integrity, it made substantial contribution to promoting sustainability standards and\ncorporate responsibility.\nThe Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is an international organisation\nworking to advice on investment implications of the ESG factors and support its global\nnetwork of signatories in incorporating these factors into their investment and governance\ndecisions. It was launched in 2006 and had over 1750 signatories from over 50 countries\nrepresenting approximately 70 USD trillion in 2017. The principles include incorporating ESG\n\n16\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nissues into organisational ownership and investment policies, seeking appropriate disclosure\non ESG issues from their parties in which organisations invest, promoting acceptance and\nimplementation of the PRI within the investment industry and reporting on their progress\ntowards implementation of the principles. PRI currently remains one of the major drivers for\nintegrating EGS issues into investment practices.\nThe Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) is a non-profit organisation established\nin 2009, which currently consists of 280 members across 41 countries. Its membership\n\nincludes institutional asset owners, pension funds, insurance organisations and asset managers.\nGIIN aims to increase the scale and effectiveness of impact investing to solve social or\nenvironmental challenges at the same time as generating financial returns. Moreover, the\nnetwork is dedicated to promoting impact investing and developing impact investment\nreporting standards and indicators. GIIN works to facilitate knowledge exchange on impact\n\ninvesting, promote innovative investment approaches and build evidence base for the\ninvestment industry.\nThe above discussed initiatives represent the history of modern sustainable finance\nand have substantial impact on sustainable banking. They provide complementing frameworks\nfor enhancing the financial sector sustainability. They are comprehensive and cover multiple\naspects of responsible finance and investment, such as credit risks, project finance and impact\ninvesting. The next section presents on of such sustainable finance initiatives, the Global\nAlliance for Banking on Values (GABV), which serves as the empirical case study for this\nthesis.\n\n1.5 Research Setting\nSustainable banks can be described as both market-oriented and mission-centred\norganisations (Boyd et al., 2009), for whom dignity, social, economic and environmental focus\nand close connectivity to their communities are a standard lens through which they evaluate\ntheir operations. They employ various business models but have a common banking model\nfocused on serving the real economy. Sustainable financial institutions make an ideal case for\nthis study for two main reasons. Firstly, sustainable banks are a relatively new, currently\nunderstudied phenomenon. They could be considered organisations that are “outliers” –\ncompanies that are experimenting with novel strategies, which have not yet received\nsubstantial attention from academics (Mohrman & Lawler, 2012). On the grounds that modern\nprofit-driven banking model applied by conventional banks is considered the norm by\nbusiness, society and policymakers, sustainable banks’ practices could be treated as a positive\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\ndeviance (Spreitzer & Sonenshein, 2004). Secondly, existing research suggested that the need\nto deliver both the community development and the financial resilience benefits shapes\nactivities, structures, processes and meanings within these sustainable organisations. In the\ncase of sustainable banks, their ethical commitments affect all aspects of their financial\noperations, as opposed to just a part of their activities or certain selected practices, which can\nbe observed in many conventional banks. Moreover, sustainable banks aim to meet their\ncommunity development commitments not only in their own operations, but also in the\nactivities of their business partners (San-Jose et al., 2011).\nSustainable banking could be defined as the “banking that aims to have a positive\nimpact on people and the environment by means of banking” (Weber & Remer, 2011).\nFollowing this definition, only a relatively small group of financial institutions worldwide\ncould qualify as confirmedly sustainable banks. One would further find that over the last ten\nyears many of them have become members or partners of the Global Alliance for Banking on\nValues (GABV). The GABV is an international network of sustainable banks, which describes\nits members as financial institutions whose “central mission is investment in a society that\nvalues human development, social cohesion and responsibility for our natural environment”\n(www.gabv.org). According to Peter Blom, the CEO of Triodos Bank (GABV member, a\npioneer in sustainable banking industry), sustainable banks could also be understood as\n“values-based” banks that “prioritise people before profits.”\nThe GABV is a Chief Executive Officer network providing a unique space for\ncollaboration for leaders, who are committed to sustainability-oriented banking. It was formed\nin March 2009 by eleven financial institutions from different countries with an idea to reset\nthe boundaries of the conventional finance and banking and promote social and environmental\ninnovations in the global financial sector. The Alliance is a network of banks and banking\ncooperatives from around the world committed to advancing positive change in the banking\nsector. The GABV is currently comprised of 62 highly diverse financial institutions and 16\nstrategic partners operating globally. They collectively hold up to $200 billion USD of assets\nunder management and serve over 67 million customers in countries across different\ncontinents. It unites institutions that use finance to support underserved communities and the\nenvironment. The Alliance describes its mission as using finance “to deliver sustainable\neconomic, social and environmental development, with a focus on helping individuals fulfil\ntheir potential and build stronger communities” (www.gabv.org). Membership in the GABV\nis based upon a Charter to use finance to find global solutions to international problems and\nto promote a positive, viable alternative to the current financial system.\n\n18\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe GABV banks emphasise positive social and environmental impacts in their\nmissions, while simultaneously acknowledging the importance of financial viability of their\noperation. It should be noted that sustainable banks represent a nascent market category and\noperate on a substantially smaller scale compared to the main players in the financial business.\nNonetheless, over the course of writing this thesis, many of the GABV banks have been\ngrowing steadily in terms of their assets, number of customers and financial returns with some\nof them achieving an increase in total assets of more than 30 per cent per year. Sustainable\nbanks provide their depositors and investors with an opportunity to achieve solid financial\nreturns, while also channelling their money to borrowers or investees, who are believed to\nmake a positive impact on the community. These banks tend to disclose their loan and\ninvestment portfolios to the public in a more transparent and detailed way than required by\nregulators. This allows banks’ stakeholders to independently evaluate whether or not banks’\ncore activities correspond to their values and expectations at any moment in time. Hence, the\nsustainable banking approach contributes to the global movement for transparency and\ndemocratisation of financial and economic processes.\nConsistent with the notion of sustainability, sustainable banking could refer to various\nfinancial activities and practices subject to the context. Previous research suggested that\ncontemporary sustainable banks could be divided into two broad categories: “poverty\nreduction banks” of the Global South and “ethical banks” of the Global North (Dossa, 2013;\nWeber & Remer, 2011). The “poverty reduction banks” primary focus on lifting people out of\nfinancial poverty through micro-finance initiatives, while “ethical banks” work on improving\ninvestment criteria to channel money into more sustainable activities and enterprises.\nAlthough sustainable banks could be further divided based on their screening approaches, the\nprimary distinction within the sustainable banking sector highlights that contemporary\nsustainable banks originate from two early predecessors: micro-credit and socially responsible\ninvesting movements.\n\nMicrocredit organisations arguably represent the first attempt to make banking\nservices available to the poorest members of global society – people who needed them the\nmost. The modern microcredit and micro-finance approaches derive their roots from the\n“Montes di Pietá” organisations founded by the religious orders of Dominicans and\nFranciscans in Italy in the fifteenth century to combat usury and provide credit to the poor.\nThe model was further prompted by the Irish microcredit funds that emerged in response to\nextreme poverty during the 1720s and were aimed at assisting the poor with offsetting a bad\nharvest or illness (Rhyne, 2001; Seibel, 2003). Similar problems in the eighteenth century\nGermany and Austria led to the creation of the first credit cooperatives and savings banks.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n19\n\nDuring that time, Raiffeisenbanken and Volksbanken were founded as savings and credit\ncooperatives in Germany to serve the unbanked poor in rural and urban areas, respectively\n(Dossa, 2013; Seibel, 2003).\nRecent poverty crises in the Global South prompted by financial crisis of 2008 and\nthe following economic recessions in many countries, resulted in the renewed interest in\nmicro-finance initiatives on many levels. Contemporary model of micro-finance is generally\nassociated with Professor Mohamed Yunus and the Grameen Bank, which he founded in\n\nBangladesh in 1975. Microfinance in its modern form was initially approached as a not-forprofit activity performed predominantly by NGOs and heavily dependent on external\ndonations. Starting from 1990s, micro-finance NGOs began departing from traditional NGOs\nin an attempt to increase their outreach. This course of development required operating in a\nself-sustaining manner by charging interest rates sufficiently high to cover the cost of lending\n\nand managing loan repayment, which was previously largely not required, though considered\ndesirable (Adams & Von Pischke, 1992; Battilana & Dorado, 2010). Since the departure from\nthe NGO archetype, financial world has witnessed a rapid expansion of micro-finance\norganisations, supported by innovations in the instruments used to finance them and make\ntheir business model more resilient. It should be mentioned that not all of these modern microfinance institutions could be considered sustainable financial organisations, which as would\nbe further suggested in this thesis are organisations that accept simultaneous liabilities for\nmultiple goals and liabilities to multiple principle stakeholders stepping from the community\ndevelopment and the banking logics. Nonetheless, many of the GABV members could be\n\nconsidered stepping from this movement. In this thesis, they will be referred to as “poverty\nreduction” banks from the Global South or GreenSouth banks.\nThe socially responsible investing (SRI) activities originate from a much older\nmovement, which dates back to the Biblical times. Each of the three major monotheistic\nreligions discouraged usury or exorbitant interest rates. While in Judaism this rule only refers\n\nto loans among Jews, the practice is all encompassing for Catholic (as stated by the Roman\nChurch’s order) and Muslim populations (Milano, 2011). Moreover, following the religious\npostulates, religious investors for centuries have avoided financing organisations that profit\nfrom products designed to kill or enslave human beings. The deepest religious origins of the\nsocially responsible investing remain reflected in the widespread avoidance of the so called\n“sin stocks”, such as companies in the alcohol, tobacco and gaming industries, by the majority\nof socially conscious investors.\nThe modern SRI movement is also grounded in the religious mandates of Quakers and\nMethodists of the seventeenth century, who are believed to have developed and applied in\n\n20\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ntheir practice the first negative-screening criteria for investments (Schueth, 2003). These first\nnegative screens were related to products enabled by the slave trade and war-related activities\n(Hutton et al., 1998; Kinder et al., 1993; Schueth, 2003). During the 1960s, the sensitivity to\nissues of social responsibility and accountability has intensified in response to concerns around\nthe Vietnam War, the Cold War and civil rights injustices. Throughout the 1970s, the SRI\nmovement further broadened to include labour issues and anti-nuclear sentiments. Finally, it\nbecame formalised in the late 1980s with millions of people, churches, universities, cities and\n\nstates focusing their investment efforts on pressuring the white minority government of South\nAfrica to end the racist Apartheid order in the country (Dosa, 2013; Hutton et al., 1998;\nSchueth, 2003).\nTherefore, whereas the establishment of the contemporary poverty reduction banks\nwas prompted by global attempts to combat usury; the modern socially responsible investing\n\nmovement could be seen as a response to issues around the widening gap between the rich and\nthe poor, the environmental pollution, the inequality between genders and the military\nconfrontation between the then superpowers (Weber & Remer, 2011). The emergence of the\nsustainable banks in the Global North has stimulated the sector to extend its efforts beyond\nnegative screening criteria and develop positive screening initiatives. While not widely\nadopted across all sustainable banks, many European sustainable banks predominantly invest\nin companies and projects that deliver positive social and economic returns for local and global\ncommunities. It could be claimed that screening criteria provides further basis for distinction\namong sustainable banks of the Global North. Sustainable banks could also vary significantly\n\nbetween the North American and the European contexts. Thus, North American sustainable\nbanks more often exercise negative screening criteria resulting in loans to businesses across\nthe sustainability spectrum. In contrast, European sustainable banks tend to engage in positive\nscreening practices to exclusively bank with sustainable companies. In this thesis, all\norganisations of this spectrum will be referred to as “ethical banks” of the Global North or\n\nGreenNorth banks.\n\n1.6 Organisation of the Thesis\nThis thesis is composed of nine chapters. Chapter 1 (entitled: Introduction) outlines\nthe motivation and goals for this study, introduces the research case study (the Global Alliance\nfor Banking on Values) and explains the distinction between sustainable banks from the Global\nNorth and the Global South. The following Chapter 2 (entitled: Sustainable Finance and\nBanking Theory) discusses the concepts of sustainability and sustainable finance and outlines\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\nthe history of the sustainable banking industry. It also provides detailed overview of the\nexisting theories of the firm and attempts to synthesise the economic and the ethical view on\norganisational responsibilities.\nChapters 3 (entitled: Pluralistic Organisational Identity in Banks: Identity, Orientation\nand Research Agenda) provides background concepts from the literatures on organisational\nidentity, pluralistic identity organisations, institutional logics and stakeholder relations.\nCombined, chapters 2 and 3 make up the theoretical background of the thesis, laying out\ntheoretical foundations of organisational sustainability and responsibility and indicating\nimportant debates and gaps that this study aims to fill. More specifically, Chapter 3 provides\nspecific framework used in the thesis by considering the concept of organisational identity and\ndiscussing the case of organisations characterised by two or more identities that would not\nnormally be expected to coexist within one organisation. It discusses previous\nconceptualisations of hybrid and multiple organisational identities and suggests synthesising\nthe two approaches into a more holistic pluralistic organisational identities concept. It further\nconsiders the relationship between organisational identity and institutional logics and\ndiscusses particular logics that govern the sustainable banking field. It suggests three ways to\nlook at organisational identity in relation to the field logics (organisational identity as\nagentically\n\nconstructed,\n\norganisational\n\nidentity as\n\ninstitutionally\n\ndetermined\n\nand\n\norganisational identity as filter) and outlines my arguments for engaging with the third\napproach. Finally, the challenges and tensions faced by pluralistic identity organisations and\nthe impact of pluralistic identities on organisational relations with stakeholders are discussed.\nThe chapter describes the organisational identity orientation framework employed in this study\nas well as other related concepts and discusses their application to the sustainable banking\nfield.\nChapter 4 (entitled: Methodology) presents the methodological framework designed\nto explore the role of identity in sustainable balancing of the community development and the\nbanking logics within the GABV banks. It provides detailed overview of my research\nphilosophy, research design, data collection tools used in this study, data analysis process and\nnotes on research credibility, ethics and limitations. Chapters 5 through 7 constitute the core\nchapters of the research findings: they summarise the findings on identity plurality in\nsustainable banks and discuss the liabilities of such plurality. Chapter 5 (entitled: Identity\nPlurality Challenges within Sustainable Banks) lays out the ways the community development\nand the banking logics affect sustainable banks. It describes tension points that sustainable\nbanks need to address to sustainably combine their plural identities and avoid a mission drift.\nChapter 6 (entitled: Liabilities for Multiple Goals) explains how the GABV banks incorporate\n\n22\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthe community development and the financial resilience goals through three sets of identity\nwork tactics, namely critiquing, contextualising and intervening. Chapter 7 (entitled:\nLiabilities to Multiple Stakeholders) summarises the findings on the organisational identity\norientation of sustainable banks and argues that these organisations take relational stance in\ntheir interactions with stakeholders. It further explains how the GABV banks express their\nrelational identity orientation through a set of six elements, which are examined in detail and\nsupported by empirical examples from my data.\nChapter 8 (entitled: Discussion) summarises findings from this study and adds\nimportant insights on the challenges faced by sustainable banks as pluralistic identity\norganisations and the ways sustainable banks address their liabilities for multiple goals and\nliabilities to multiple principle stakeholders. Finally, Chapter 9 (entitled: Conclusion) presents\nresearch insights, contributions and limitations of the thesis and makes suggestions for future\nresearch directions. Combined, the thesis is comprised of two background chapters following\nthe introduction (Ch. 2 and 3), one methodology chapter (Ch. 4), three chapters devoted to\nresearch findings (Ch. 5, 6 and 7) and two concluding chapters (Ch. 8 and 9).\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n23\n\n24\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\nAn Overview\n\n2.1 Introduction\nSustainability considerations in organisational studies emerged in the 1930s, with a\nnumber of theories of the firm starting to explore the complex interconnection between\nsustainability and firms. Finding a balance between developing the communities in which a\nbank operates and remaining financially resilient requires devotion, expertise and constant\nattention to these dual goals. If a bank is going to forego a certain level of profitability in order\nto achieve the community benefit, it becomes essential to understand how these ideas are\nreflected in its organisational identity or raison d’être. Previous studies have applied a variety\nof paradigms to study the discourse of sustainable finance and banking. Two main perspectives\nand research agendas could be noticed within the existing theories of the firm. One group\ncould be attributed to have an economic approach, which implied an agenda to maximise\nfinancial profitability without accounting for the side effects of corporate operations. The\nsecond group could be referred to as an ethical approach characterised by emphasis on\nextended organisational responsibilities for common good.\nThis chapter provides a critical review of the way major theories of the firm perceive\nand conceptualise sustainability and the role of the firm. The ethical and the economic\napproaches represent the opposing ends of a spectrum, where multiple organisational theories\ncould be positioned. It was previously suggested that finding a common theoretical ground\nbetween the economic and the ethical perspectives would contribute to more sustainable and\ncommunity focused finance and banking practice. This chapter discusses the main theories of\nthe firm and their contributions to the corporate sustainability discourse. It further critically\nanalyses the current state of the debate between the economic and the ethical approaches to\nthe role of the firm in society. Finally, it proposes a theoretical framework for integrating the\neconomic and the ethical perspectives to explore the phenomenon of sustainable finance and\nbanking.\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n25\n\n2.2 The Theories of the Firm\nTheories of the firm provide theoretical framework for studying organisations and\nanswering research questions about their existence, behaviour, structure and relationships with\nexternal constituencies. Seth and Thomas (1994) further suggested that theories of the firm\npresent frameworks for thinking about the purpose of organisation and analysing related\nresearch problems. Over the past decades, several theories of the firm have been developed,\n\nhowever, the discussion of organisational sustainability within most of them remains scarce.\nThis chapter presents an overview of the most significant theories of the firm and specifies\ntheir contribution to the sustainability discourse. Moreover, the discussion highlights\nlimitations of existing theories of the firm in addressing sustainability problems and suggests\nmost promising directions for future research on sustainability. The selection and\n\ncategorisation of theories of the firm in this chapter is derived from Seth and Thomas (1994)\nand Lozano et al. (2015), who suggested that various theories of the firm could be\nconceptualised along three main directions: (1) corporate entity or personality perspective,\nwhich focuses on the establishment of firm as a legal person; (2) corporate nature perspective,\nwhich analysis the reasons of firm existence and its relations with other constituencies; and\n(3) corporate obligations perspective, which discusses organisational responsibilities in\nsociety.\n\n2.2.1 Corporate Entity or Personality Theories\nThe first group of theories of the firm presents the most developed discussions on\norganisational personality. Based on Radin (1932: 645), personality here is interpreted as “a\ngroup of rights and capacities, or at any rate a group of legal relations, and this group owes its\nexistence entirely to the recognition of it by the legal and institutional organisation of the\ncommunity”. Corporate entity theory has its roots in French and German common law and\n\nfocus on discussing what legal form should an organisation take and how should it be\npositioned vis-a-vis the government. In addition, Millon (1990) provided a comprehensive\noverview of the corporate entity theory development in the U.S. claiming its relevance for the\nAmerican legal context. Corporate entity theories could be divided into the artificial entity, the\naggregate entity and the real entity concepts.\n\n26\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n2.2.1.1 The Artificial Entity Theory\nThis theory of the firm provides insights on the process of organisational\nestablishment and incorporation within a social context. Corporate entity could be considered\nartificial if it was formed under the state law without private initiative of individual\nincorporators (Millon, 1990). Such an organisation, therefore, represents an extension of the\nstate (Avi-Yonah, 2005) rather than a corporate citizen. The emphasis in the artificial entity\ntheory is on the authority granted to an organisation by the government. Thus, without such\nstate authorisation, corporations could not have legal personality, own property or hire agents\nto act in their name (Avi-Yonah, 2005).\nThe artificial entity theory was introduced in the nineteenth century by Savigny, who\nproposed a view of corporation as a fictitious being (Machen, 1911). He commented on the\n\nexamples of Dutch East India and the British East India Companies and theorised about their\nincorporation and corporate nature (Avi-Yonah, 2005). In contemporary organisational\nresearch, the artificial entity theory is useful for studying state-owned corporations that usually\noperate within a single legal and social context (Lozano et al., 2015). Avi-Yonah (2005)\nfurther suggested that the theory has limited applicability to studies of multinational\n\ncorporations, particularly those with weak government ties or operating in developing\ninstitutional contexts with weak or poor governments.\nThe author’s understanding and interpretation of this theory is that organisation could\nbe viewed as an extension of the government regime that licensed its incorporation. Such\nnature of the firm is likely to have severe management and strategy implications due to the\nmanagers’ weak standing and limited decision-making power. The artificial entity theory was\nintroduced long before the concept of sustainability appeared in organisational studies,\ntherefore, the discussion of corporate responsibilities here is limited to its relations with the\nstate that incorporated it.\n2.2.1.2 The Aggregate Entity Theory\nThe aggregate entity theory proposes an alternative perspective of the process of\norganisational establishment and incorporation within a social context and the actors involved\nin it. Contrary to the artificial entity theory, which treats corporation as an extension of the\nstate, it suggests the view of corporation as an extension of its shareholders (Lozano et al.,\n2015). The aggregate entity theory originated from theory of Zweckvermögen by Bekker and\nvon Brinz, who started explaining corporate ownership in charitable corporations focusing on\nthe role of agents that manage corporate property instead of the ownership of property by an\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n27\n\nobject (Almeida et al., 2017). The theory states that corporation can be formed and legally\nincorporated by an association of actors, who make an agreement to start an enterprise.\nTherefore, an organisation should be viewed as a sum of its human and non-human\ncomponents (Avi-Yonah, 2005; Lozano et al., 2015).\nIn this interpretation, corporate shareholders are protected by the rule of limited\nliability. They provide the capital with the anticipation of maximising its values, however,\nthey cannot be charged for illegal actions committed by the legal entity, its managers or its\n\nemployees (Millon, 1990). According to the aggregate entity theory, the purpose of\norganisation is generating profit for the exclusive benefit of its shareholders. As a result, the\ntheory threats organisations as entities separate from the society and the environment and\nlargely neglects the problem of community relations. The aggregate entity theory is based on\nthe interpretation of organisation as a means for increasing financial returns on capital of\n\nshareholders, whose liabilities are limited, and benefits are not compromised by considerations\nof community relations. The foundations of this theory limit its discussion of corporate\nresponsibilities to the economic dimension and specifically organisational liabilities to its\nshareholders. Therefore, although the aggregate entity theory assigns managers considerable\ndecision-making freedom and power of determining strategy, it emphasises that they are\nsubjected to the interests of shareholders.\n2.2.1.3 The Real Entity Theory\nUnlike the two other corporate entity theories that treat organisations as an\n\naggregation of natural persons or an extension on the state power, the real entity theory states\nthat an organisation should be viewed as a new real person (Lozano et al., 2015). It suggests\nthat the existence of organisation is not based on a fiction or a mental entity. The real entity\ntheory views an organisation as a social organism, which differs from a biological organism\nin regard to the power of reproduction (Machen, 1911). An organisation, therefore, becomes\na persona representata, which acts through its agents but has \"will and senses\" (Ibid, 1911).\nThe real entity theory further perceives organisations are actual “beings” controlled\nby their managers. Proponents of this theory claim that organisations as any collective groups\nhave real mind, will and ability to act (Almeida et al., 2017). Whereas in the aggregate entity\n\ntheory only organisational managers and employees could be held responsible for illegal\nactions, in the real entity theory organisations themselves could be punished for breaking the\nregulation. Thus, this perspective for the first time proposed that an organisation should face\nlegal charges for omission and commission (Avi-Yonah, 2005).\n\n28\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\nThe real entity theory proposes that organisations should be interpreted as real entities\nintegrated within the fabric of society. It is viewed as an entity incorporated and represented\nby its managers and employees and cannot be limited to an extension of the state or\nshareholders. The real entity theory further suggests that an organisation, its managers and\nemployees all have legal rights and liabilities. According to the real entity theory, managers\nare responsible for ensuring that the organisation and its employees comply with state\nregulations (Lozano et al., 2015). This vision empowers them to engage with the community\n\non different matters and make strategic actions to contribute to sustainability. Therefore, it\ncould be concluded that, even though the real entity theory does not explicitly engage in the\ndiscussion around corporate responsibilities, its foundations are implicitly suggesting the\nfreedom of organisational actors in choosing direction, as well as their responsibility for\nstrategic actions.\n2.2.1.4 Insights from Corporate Entity Theories\nCorporate entity theories focus their main discussions around two foundational\ndebates: the incorporation of an organisation and its legal status, rights and liabilities within a\n\nstate context. The artificial entity theory made substantial contribution at the early stage of\ntheoretical development within the corporate entity discourse, however, nowadays its\napplicability has been limited to the discussion of state-owned corporations. The aggregate\nentity theory has a strong emphasis on economic issues and perceives an organisation as a\nlegal instrument to limit the liabilities of shareholders within a state context. The real entity\n\ntheory frames an organisation as a legal actor, which is represented by managers and\nemployees but has rights and liabilities of its own.\nCorporate entity theories analyse the incorporation of an organisation in a state legal\nframework. In particular, the artificial entity conceptualises organisation as an extension of the\ngovernment and largely ignores other groups of stakeholders, the aggregate entity theory\ncentres on organisational shareholders and contributes to the discussion of internal\nstakeholders, while the real entity discusses the rights and liabilities of an organisation to its\nexternal stakeholders. Corporate entity theories also present different perspectives on how\nmanagers could make strategic decisions within the organisation. The artificial entity theory\n\nstates that organisational leadership is restricted to the general policy of the state, the aggregate\ntheory views them as independent agents acting on behalf of shareholders with the aim to\nmaximise their returns on investments, whereas the real entity theory proposes that\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n29\n\norganisational management is bound in their decision-making by the rules of both the\ngovernment and the larger society.\nIt should be noted that none of the corporate entity theories explicitly point out the\nquestion of corporate sustainability since most of them were formed prior the sustainability\ndiscourse appeared in the organisational studies. Nevertheless, one of the foundations of the\nreal entity theory is that an organisation has responsibilities to comply with state regulations\nand social rules within the context of its incorporation, which is congruent with the\n\nsustainability discourse in admitting that organisations are part of a larger legal rights system\n(Lozano et al., 2015). The real entity theory provides the greatest flexibility in deciding areas\nof strategic priority for an organisation that might include matters beyond income generation.\nTherefore, it could be suggested that the real entity theory has the biggest potential to\ncontribute to the organisational sustainability discourse by including the discussion of\n\nenvironmental and social responsibilities of organisations.\n\n2.2.2 Corporate Nature Theories\nThe corporate nature theories discuss the nature of the firm’s existence. Boatright\n\n(1996) summarised the main historical developments with the nature of the firm discourse and\nproposed three central frameworks, which have made the most substantial contributions: the\ncontractual theory (including its specific part – the agency theory), the evolutionary theory and\nthe resource based view (RBV) theory.\n\n2.2.2.1 The Contractual Theory and the Agency Theory\nCoase (1937) in his foundational paper proposed the view of the firm as a nexus of\ncontracts among various constituencies. He claimed that two forms of economic coordination\ncould be distinguished: firms and markets. The use of the hierarchical and market coordination\n\nis determined by transaction costs. The cost of negotiating and enforcing contracts requires\ncoordination, which can often be achieved more efficiently through organisations and\nsubstitute other hierarchical forms of decision-making. Boatright (1996: 221) further\nsuggested that “firms exist as less costly alternatives to market transactions”. He proposed that\n“shareholders, along with other investors, employees and the like, each own asset that they\n\nmake available to the firm” (Boatright, 1999: 171).\nThe contractual theory follows the aggregate entity theory (Phillips, 2003) in\nperceiving the interests of shareholders as imperative. They are viewed as the residual risk\nbearers, who provide capital to an organisation to receive dividends and a claim of residual\n\n30\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\nassets (Coase, 1937). This determines their unique position within the organisation as the only\nagents with appropriate incentives to make decisions that will maximise organisational wealth\nbecause they bear costs and gain benefits of the firm’s activity. According to the contractual\ntheory, interests of other parties, such as employees, customers, creditors and others, are also\nbest served when shareholders’ interests become the objective of the firm (Boatright, 1996).\nThe contractual theory postulates were criticised on the basis that contracts in most\ncases are bilateral and incomplete in addressing the interests of parties other than stakeholders\n\nand, therefore, could create conditions for large corporations to use their power to gain unfair\nadvantageous contracts or cause other unanticipated negative outcomes for stakeholders\n(Boatright, 1996). Moreover, contractual obligations could be perceived differently by the\nmarket, the firm and the government and could have hidden social costs (Lozano et al., 2015).\nThus, they could neglect negative social and environmental externalities of organisational\n\nactivities and undesired community effects in order to maximise short-term shareholder\nreturns (Boatright, 1996). Therefore, while the contractual theory provides valuable insights\non safeguarding shareholders’ interests by making them the objective of an organisational and\nthe subject of fiduciary duties of managers, it’s contribution to the discussion of protecting\nnon-shareholder constituencies is limited.\nThe agency theory is often discussed as a particular case of the contractual theory\n(Lozano et al., 2015). It has been very present in research on publicly traded commercial\norganisations due to its focus on regulating the relations between agents and principals.\nAgency theory claims that managers pursue their own interests and, therefore, their decisions\n\nshould be structured, bonded and monitored within an organisation to minimise the conflict of\ninterests. It further suggests that individual agents should not possess management and\noversight powers over the same decisions. Therefore, the agency theory is centred around the\nproblems of ownership and governance (Jensen & Meckling, 1976) discussing the conditions\nunder which managers are most likely to work in the best interest of their principals.\n\nBoatright (1996) and Machlup (1967) proclaimed both the contractual theory and the\nagency theory marginalistic due to their foundations in the aggregate theory of the firm. These\nperspectives see the purpose of organisation in maximising shareholder return on capital by\nminimising transaction costs directly or through the means of contracting agents. The\ncontractual theory and the agency theory emphasise the contractual nature of organisational\nrelations with stakeholders, therefore, claiming these relations to have a formal and framed\ncharacter (Lozano et al., 2015). Such interpretation provides little insights on the nature of\ncontracts and the power relationships among the contract parties. Moreover, the contractual\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n31\n\ntheory perceives an organisation as “black box” and mainly focuses on relations with external\nstakeholders.\nThe contractual theory and the agency theory extended previous understanding of the\nrelational approach to profit creation. The agency theory raises the question of strategic\nplanning horizons by suggesting that guided by their contractual obligations, agents might\nprioritise short-term gains and neglect more prospective business opportunities and future\ncontracts. They could also underscore potential synergies between various projects and clients\n\ndue to contract terms, organisational structure or corporate relationships. Moreover, these\ntheories’ vision of contractual relationships as a way to minimise costs and increase benefits\nin both short and longer term perspectives could contribute to the sustainability discourse,\nparticularly in areas of creating networks and facilitating engagement on environmental and\nsocial corporate responsibilities.\n2.2.2.2 The Evolutionary Theory\nThe evolutionary theory of the firm was first introduced by Nelson and Winter (1982).\nIt defines organisation as a set of routines and competencies that it encompasses. Hölzl (2005)\n\nsuggested that the evolutionary theory predominantly focuses on the technological aspects of\nproduction and the cognitive nature of the organisational structure. Similar to the contractual\nand the agency theories, the evolutionary theory suggests that organisations are profit driven,\nhowever, not all corporate actions are presumed to be profit maximising (Lozano et al., 2015).\nHölzl (2005) further emphasised the importance of differential capabilities embedded in the\n\npersonal and organisational structure of corporations for organisational research, particularly\nskills on the individual level and routines at the organisational level.\nThe evolutionary perspective further proposes that organisations rely on a particular\nset of routines that are firm-specific and cannot be transferred at low cost (Hölzl, 2005). Based\non Social Darwinism, it claims that only the strongest and most efficient organisations will\nsurvive the market competition within each segment (Miesing & Preble, 1985). According to\nthe evolutionary theory, more resourceful and profitable organisations will push less profitable\ncompetitors out of business. This approach explains the adaptivity in organisational behaviour\nthrough tensions between innovation and election mechanisms (Hölzl, 2005). It should be\n\npointed out that this approach is based on financial strength of organisations and does not\naccount for ethical considerations and community outlook (Lozano et al., 2015). Moreover,\nthe evolutionary theory also provides limited discussion of the long-term organisational\nstrategy and instead focuses on short-term competitive power and financial gains.\n\n32\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\nTherefore, the evolutionary theory puts emphasis on the time dimension by claiming\nthat organisations grow in size and resources with the aim of participating in market\ncompetition, which they drive to extinction (Lozano et al., 2015). Important for the discussion\nor organisational sustainability, this perspective claims that organisations evolve through the\ncombined mechanisms of searching and selection. Moreover, they possess a possibility to\ntransform their secondary routines into core organisational activities (Hölzl, 2005). Following\nthis narrative, one could expect that in the long-term perspective more sustainability orientated\n\norganisations might drive less sustainability orientated competitors out of the market. Even\nthough the evolutionary theory does not explicitly discuss such vision, competitive stimulus\ncould be used by managers to develop longer-term strategic plans, which would be congruent\nwith the corporate sustainability discourse should it also concern a vision for social and\nenvironmental components of long-term strategic planning.\n2.2.2.3 The Resource-Based View Theory\nThe resource-based view of the firm sees an organisation as a combination of\nresources necessary for organisational survival and gaining competitive advantage (Conner &\n\nPrahalad, 1996). It states that organisations are entities created by people to serve the needs of\npeople. The resource-based view presumes the disequilibrium model of firm growth and seeks\nto “maintain administrative coordination within a multi-stakeholder environment” (Kor et al.,\n2016: 1728). Penrose (1959) suggested that organisational resources could be divided into two\nmain types, namely tangible resources (land, natural resources, machinery and finished goods)\n\nand human resources (unskilled and skilled labour, administrative, financial, legal, technical\nand managerial staff). Sanchez and Heene (1997) further added third type of intangible\nresources, where they included capabilities and cognitions.\nThe resource-based view made substantial contribution to the academic discussion of\ncompetitive advantages of firms and ways of reducing production costs without losing\ncustomers and competitive positions. This perspective further proposed that while certain\norganisational resources are easily replaceable, others take long time to develop. Barney et al.\n(2001) also suggested that some resources can only be developed internally within the\norganisation and cannot be transferred from other organisations. Moreover, Dyllick and\n\nHockerts (2002) climes that not all resources can be imitated or substituted by alternatives.\nAccording to Penrose (1959), managers have a central catalyst role in the process of\nconvective productive resources into services.\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n33\n\nTherefore, in contact to previous theories of the firm that treated organisation as a\n“black box”, the foundational principle of the resource-based view is that organisations are\ncomplex systems of internally linked resources, whose combination provides unique\ncompetitive advantages. It should be mentioned that the theory in its original form does not\nconsider the environmental dimensions, however, it does provide insights on social and time\ndimensions through its discussions of resources management and development over time.\nNonetheless, this perspective provides valuable lenses of exploring organisational leadership\n\nand governance by linking organisational resources to proactive changes in strategy and\nprocesses. Thus, Penrose (1959) suggested that managers’ experience-based knowledge of\norganisational resources and capabilities determines how the organisation will perceive the\nmarket and which market opportunities it will pursue. She further claimed that managers with\nfirm-specific knowledge and experience are essential for identifying growth opportunities and\n\ncarrying out growth projects for the organisation. In terms of sustainability and corporate\nresponsibility discourse, the resource-based view could be useful for introducing\nenvironmental and social considerations into corporate governance studies, particularly in the\ninstitutional context, where they are likely to help the organisation gain competitive advantage.\n\n2.2.2.4 Insights from Corporate Nature Theories\nCorporate nature theories predominantly focus on the matters of organisational\nexistence. Grounded in economic precepts, they use as a foundational concept the reduction\nof costs, the strengthening of organisational competencies or the competitive positioning\n\nwithin the market. Thus, the contractual theory and the agency theory focus on intraorganisational contractual relations between agents and principals as a means to reduce costs\nof production and maximise shareholder returns. The central question of the evolutionary\ntheory is competitive positioning and relative profitability vis-a-vis other market participants.\nTherefore, unlike two previous theories whose focal point are internal stakeholders, this\nperspective discusses the problem of out-evolving competitors, i.e. the external stakeholders.\nFinally, the resource-based view theory concentrates on the problem of building a unique\ncombination of capabilities from internal and external resources over time in order to reduce\ncosts of production and gaining sustainable competitive advantage.\n\nThe main contribution of the corporate nature theories to the sustainability and\ncorporate responsibilities discourse is that they provide organisational management with\nvarious perspectives on how to engage with diverse stakeholders in the short and in the long\nterm (Lozano et al., 2015). Even though the economic dimension keeps its central position\n\n34\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\nwithin the corporate nature discussions, unlike the corporate entity theories, these concepts\nexplicitly discuss the needs and expectations of a variety of stakeholders both within and\noutside the organisation. Thus, the contractual theory provides a well develop discussion of\nagent-principal relations within an organisation, the evolutionary theory investigates strategic\nprocesses designed to move competitors out of the market, while the resource-based view\ncontributes to debates on analysing organisational resources and building organisational\ncapabilities in long-term perspective. Therefore, it could be claimed that the corporate nature\n\ntheories contribute to research on social and time dimensions of organisational strategic\nplanning and operations, however, the environmental component remains outside of their\nfocus.\n\n2.2.3 Corporate Obligation Theories\nThe corporate obligation theories aim to explain organisational liabilities towards\nvarious stakeholder groups. Their foundational question is the one of how managers perceive\norganisational goals and strategy and whether they prioritise interests of shareholders of other\nparties (Boatright, 1996). This group of theories of the firm includes the stockholder theory,\n\nthe social contract theory and the stakeholder theory.\n2.2.3.1 The Shareholder Theory\nThe main postulate of the shareholder or stockholder theory is that organisations have\nsolely fiduciary duties towards their shareholders, who act as capital providers. Organisations\nwork to maximise capital returns for shareholders by growing their market value (Friedman,\n1970). This concept has foundations in the aggregate theory of the firm and is often viewed as\nmarginalistic (Boatright, 1996). Shareholders provide capital with the expectation of earning\nreturn on investments and become residual risk bearers. As a result of this transaction, they\n\ngain prima facie rights and limited liabilities (Freeman et al., 2004). Consequently,\nshareholders receive substantial power and influence in determining operational strategy of\nthe organisation (Thomas et al., 2004). Within the stakeholder framework, managers do not\nhave power to allocate capital to fulfil community interests without the consent of shareholders\n(Freeman et al., 2004). At the same time, their strategic and operational decisions might\n\ndisadvantage other stakeholder groups, such as employees, consumers, suppliers and local\ncommunities (Lozano et al., 2015). In the long-term perspective, such approach might cause\nnegative consequences not only for the society and the environment, but also lead to\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n35\n\nrepetitional damages and put at risk organisational legitimacy with the society or the\ngovernment (White, 2004).\nLangtry (1994) distinguished three types of normative ethical shareholder theories.\nFirstly, the minimalist pure shareholder theories state that firms exist solely to maximise\nreturns on investments for shareholders and their activity should be constrained by minimal\nlegal frames, such as contract enforcement and fraud prevention. They also claim that\nmanagers have fiduciary obligations to shareholders. Secondly, non-minimalist pure\n\nshareholder theories share basic ground with the previous type but propose broader and more\nfar-reaching legal constraints on the firm. Finally, tinged shareholder theories state that firms\nexist to maximise shareholders’ profit, however, their operations should be restricted not only\nby legal constraints but also by moral or social obligations. Such moral and social obligations\nwould be defined differently by each tinged shareholder theory and might consist of moral\n\nrights of a broader community or a specific category of stakeholders, such as organisational\nemployees.\nThe shareholder theory had significant impact on organisational research and practice\nand became widely used as a tool for strategic management (Langtry, 1994). The theory has\noften been criticised for the postulates it shares with the aggregate theory of the firm due to\ntheir multiple foundational similarities. The main difference between the two theories is in\ntheir focus, as the stakeholder theory mainly describes how organisations generate returns on\ninvestments for their shareholders, while the aggregate theory discusses how organisations\nare established legally (Lozano et al., 2015). The shareholder theory of the firm suggests that\n\norganisations are solely liable to their shareholders and exist to generate profit for their residual\nrisk bearers. It makes little contribution to the discussion of social and environment\ndimensions of organisational performance (Boatright, 1996). Within this perspective,\norganisation is perceived as an “island”, which has led to Hasnas (1998) describing the\nstakeholder theory as an “outmoded relic of corporate law that even the law itself has evolved\n\nbeyond”. Such approach appears short-term focused and neglects the longer-term\nconsiderations of organisational sustainability. It could be argued that the main contribution\nof the shareholder theory to debates on sustainability and corporate responsibilities lies in the\neconomic dimension of this framework, which prescribes organisational management with\nliability to operate the firm in an efficient and effective manner.\n\n36\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n2.2.3.2 The Social Contract Theory\nThe social contract theory of the firm has its foundations in the political social contract\ntheories of Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau and shares many\npreconceptions with the contractual theory as interpreted by Coase (1937). Its main thesis is\nthat organisations have an ethical obligation to enhance the welfare of society. The firms are\nexpected to fulfil general canons of justice and maintain their implicit moral contracts with\ninternal (employees) and external (suppliers and customers) stakeholders. The social contract\ntheory is based on the understands social contract as an implicit agreement between the society\nand the firm in which the society “recognises the existence of the entity on the condition that\nit serves the interests of society in certain specified ways” (Hasnas, 1998: 29). It further\nproposes that the society provides organisations with the right to operate by giving them legal\n\nrecognition, authorisation to use resources and hire members of the society (Lozano et al.,\n2015). In return, organisations are expected to abide by social and moral contracts and provide\nsocial benefits (Hasnas, 1998).\nThe social contract theory extends the contractual theory of the firm to the realm of\ncivil society, which it claims to give organisations a “licence-to-operate” (White, 2004). The\n\nperspective states that the firm has liabilities not only to its shareholders or agents, but to the\nsociety, which has the ultimate power to grant or withdraw the “licence-to-operate”. The main\nfocus of this theory is on the social dimensions of sustainability and its main discussion is\nconcerned with how organisations fulfil the obligations implicit under the social contract\n(Lozano et al., 2015). The social contract theory, therefore, provides a guidance for\norganisational managers on how to extend the principles of contractual theory from agents and\nprincipals to relations with a wider group of stakeholders.\nIt could be argued that the social contract theory shares many foundational principles\nand interpretation with the stakeholder theory, however, focuses exclusively on social\n\nstakeholders, therefore, leaving open a question of its scope or extent in the context of\ncorporate responsibility (Lozano et al., 2015). Though providing many valuable insights, it\noffers limited explanations of how a social contract should or could enforced. Moreover, the\nsocial contract theory does not explicitly discuss economic, environmental, and time\ndimensions of sustainability.\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n37\n\n2.2.3.3 The Stakeholder Theory\nThe central postulate of the stakeholder theory claims is that the firm has liabilities to\nmultiple stakeholders (Freeman, 1984). This perspective takes into account both the internal\nstakeholders, such as managers and employees, and external stakeholders, such as suppliers,\ncustomers, regulators and community groups (Freeman et al., 2004). It further perceives\nshareholders stakeholders as both internal and external organisational stakeholders. The\nstakeholder theory of the firm divides all stakeholders into primary and secondary, where\nprimary ones are directly affected by organisational operations or have direct power over the\norganisation, whereas secondary stakeholders’ interactions with the firm are usually collateral\nor mediated (McIntosh et al., 1998). Therefore, contrary to precious theories of the firm that\nemphasised its economic nature, the stakeholder theory proposes that the fundamental\n\nobligation of the firm is to grow its capital and market share, while simultaneously meeting\nthe needs of multiple stakeholders (Hasnas, 1998).\nIn should be pointed out that though the initial focus of the stakeholder theory was on\nsocial stakeholders, more recent academic works started increasingly using this framework to\naddress environmental issues. Thus, Céspedes-Lorente et al. (2004) suggested four ways the\n\nstakeholder theory can contribute to the environmental sustainability discussion. Firstly, the\nstakeholder theory pointed out to the role of external stakeholders in assessing environmental\nrisks of organisational operations and accounting for corporate environmental performance of\nthe firm. Secondly, the theory emphasised the significance of environmental reporting and\ntransparent communication of the environmental impact, as well as the important role of\ncommunity activists in keeping the firms accountable. Thirdly, the stakeholder theory\nprovided detailed analysis of the impact stakeholders might have on the environmental\nstrategy of an organisation. Finally, this perspective discussed the importance of cooperation\nbetween an organisation and its multiple stakeholder groups on environmental issues.\n\nThe stakeholder theory of the firm provides valuable lenses for organisational\nmanagers to understand how to engage with multiple stakeholders that are affected by their\noperations and have the power to influence organisational strategy. The main focus of this\ntheory is in analysing and managing corporate relationships with diverse stakeholders from\nsocial, economic and environmental realms. The stakeholder theory had substantial impact on\n\nsustainability and corporate responsibility discourse. At the same time, this perspective has\nbeen criticised for some inherent inconsistencies, particularly regarding the identification of\nthe most salient stakeholders and prioritising their interests (Langtry, 1994). Other debates\nconcerned the ability of the firm to meet diverse expectations of stakeholders without\n\n38\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\nsubstantially decreasing capital returns (Dyllick & Hockerts, 2002) and to foresee the\ncommunity impact of organisational operations (Langtry, 1994).\n2.2.3.4 Insights from Corporate Obligation Theories\nCorporate obligation theories focus their discussions on the problem of managing\nobligations of the firm. Thus, the central postulate of the shareholder theory is that\norganisations exist to maximise the return on capital provided by the shareholders. Therefore,\n\nit is predominantly focused on the economic dimension of the firm. The shareholder theory\nalso contributed to the social dimension research on internal stakeholders by suggesting that\norganisations should protect their investors as residual risk bearers through the limited liability\nprinciple. The social contract theory, on the contrary, emphasised the role of external\nstakeholders, who provide an organisation with a “licence-to-operate”. It proposed that the\nfirm has moral obligations to the society, which include abiding by social and moral contracts\nand providing social benefits to local community. Finally, the stakeholder theory states that\nthe form is liable to multiple groups of stakeholders. It addresses many issues of managing\nsocial and environmental dimensions, while also acknowledging the centrality of the survival\n\nand thriving of the organisation (economic dimension). The theory provided valuable\ncontribution to the discussion of the role of organisational in society and organisational\nrelations with both internal and external stakeholders.\nIt could be claimed that the corporate obligation theories of the firm have been\ndesigned to help explain organisational liabilities to their stakeholders and their role in\n\norganisational survival and prosperity. Answering the fundamental question of the purpose the\norganisation, these theories account for a broad range of organisational interactions and\ndiscuss their significance for achieving corporate goals. Their approaches vary from a narrow\nview of the shareholder theory, to a broader perspective of the social contract theory focused\non external stakeholders, to the broadest angle of the stakeholder theory, which incorporates\nthe economic, social and environmental dimensions (Lozano et al., 2015). Contrary to the\nprevious theories of the firm that have traditionally focused on accounting solely for the\ninterests of their shareholders, corporate obligation theories touched upon the questions of\nrecognising and addressing the needs of various internal and external stakeholders. These\n\nperspectives proposed a view of the firm as a complex system whose operations impact and\ncould be impacted by the society and the environment.\nTherefore, corporate obligation theories provide valuable lenses to navigate\norganisational management in embedding sustainability dimensions into their strategy and\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n39\n\noperations and building healthy and mutually beneficial relations with stakeholders. At the\nsame time, it should be mentioned that the corporate obligation theories do not provide much\ninsight on the effects of the time dimension and rarely explicitly focus on the longevity of\norganisational stakeholder relations over time. Making distinction between long-term and\nshort-term corporate strategies would help move these ideas forward and make them more\nuseful for addressing sustainability issues.\n\n2.2.4 Discussion of the Theories of the Firm’s Contributions to Corporate\nSustainability Discourse\nBryman (2003) claimed that due to the socially constructed nature of firms, theories\nformed to advance the knowledge about them fall into the realm of middle range theories. This\n\nsection provided an overview of the most significant theories of the firm and discussed their\ncontributions to the corporate sustainability discourse. The analysis singled conceptual\ndominance of the aggregate theory postulates that are evident in the shareholder and the\ncontractual theories. This traces back to the historical and cultural focus on organisational\nrights rather than responsibilities (McIntosh et al., 1998). The establishment of sustainable\n\ndevelopment ideas and their acknowledgement within the organisational studies has led to the\nrecognition that organisations are liable for their goals and liable to multiple stakeholder\ngroups beyond shareholders (see Carroll, 1991; Freeman et al., 2004). These recent\ndevelopments also included understanding that the firm can no longer be perceived as a “black\nbox”, whose role is limited to profit generation and job creation, and the following attempts to\ntheoretically combine the economic and the ethical side of the firm.\nFollowing the discussion on sustainability from the previous chapter, the contributions\nof each theory of the firm have been discussed here within the context of the four dimensions\nof sustainability (Lozano, 2008). Most of these theories of the firm focus on the economic and\nthe social dimensions. The evolutionary theory and the resource-based view emphasise the\ntime dimension, with the former focusing on the organisation outliving its competitors in the\nmarket and the latter proposing the importance of building unique organisational capabilities\nover time. The stakeholder theory explicitly comments on the environmental dimension of\nsustainability in its discussion of liabilities of the firm. Other concepts prioritise economic and\n\nsocial dimensions without making meaningful contributions to the discussion on the time and\nthe environment. This sharply contrasts with the environmental bias of early corporate\nsustainability discourse (see Atkinson, 2000; Rees, 2002; Reinhardt, 2000) as discussed in the\nprevious chapters.\n\n40\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\nEven though none of the theories of the firm provided full account of the four\ndimensions of sustainability, each of them has contributed some valuable principles. Thus, the\ncorporate entity theories discussed in detail the questions of incorporation of the firm and its\nperception within the legal state context. The corporate nature theories offered contributions\non the existence of firms and the way they perceive their corporate resources and use them to\naddress market competition. Finally, the corporate obligations theories contributed to the\ndiscussion of organisational stakeholder relations and liabilities beyond the ones to the\n\nshareholders as capital providers. The overview provided in this chapter helped clarify\npropositions of different theories of the firm, critically analyse their similarities and\ndifferences and develop valid interpretations of the key postulates to further focus on their\nsignificance for sustainable finance and banking research. The next section will further\nconceptualise the debate between the economic and the ethical perspectives of the role of the\n\nfirm and propose theoretical framework for synthesising the two approaches and incorporating\nthem into the study of sustainable finance and banking.\n\n2.3 The Theories of the Firm and Sustainable Finance and Banking\nDiscourse\nAs pointed out in the previous chapter, corporate sustainability studies within the\norganisational research have experienced strong bias towards the social dimension of\nsustainability. Environmental and time dimensions have often not been explicitly discussed\nand accounted for in the existing studies. Among the attempts to categorise corporate\nsustainability theories, several studies propose particularly useful and original outlooks.\nKlonoski (1991) distinguished three types of theories of the firm with the emphasis on\ncorporate\n\nresponsibility\n\nand\n\nsustainability.\n\nThe first\n\ngroup\n\nof\n\ntheories\n\ncalled\n\n“fundamentalism” perceives organisations as legal entities that are solely liable to maximise\nshareholder returns and comply with the existing state legal framework. The second group\nfocuses on the moral agency of the firm viewed as a “moral agent” or “moral person” and\nstands for the organisational moral personhood and accountability for their actions. Finally,\nthe third group of sustainability theories are based on postulates from political and ethical\ntheories and propose a view of organisation as a “social institution” with social\n\nresponsibilities.\nGarriga and Melé (2004) in their foundational study distinguished four groups of\ntheories of the firm confused on corporate responsibility and representing discussions on\nvarious aspects of the social reality, namely economics, politics, social integration and ethics.\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n41\n\nThe first group emphasises the economic aspect of sustainability and perceives the firm as an\ninstrument for shareholder wealth creation. The second group focuses on the power aspect of\nthe organisation and its responsibility in the social politics realm. The third group of corporate\nresponsibility theories discusses social integration and proposes that the firm should integrate\nsocial demands. Finally, the focal point of the fourth group is ethics and the premise that\ninteractions between the firm and the society should be embedded with ethical considerations.\nIn should be mentioned that Garriga and Melé (2004) classified corporate responsibility\n\ntheories based on their main focus, however, admitting that in many cases theories incorporate\nmore than one aspect. Moreover, they proposed that “the concept of business and society\nrelationship must include these four aspects or dimensions and some connection among them\nmust exist” (2004: 64).\nWindsor (2006) also suggested three key approaches to corporate sustainability in\n\norganisational studies. Firstly, economic responsibility theories stand for a minimalist\napproach to corporate responsibility, where the primary corporate duty of creating wealth is\nonly restricted by utilitarian and investor property rights rationales (Sternberg, 1996).\nSecondly, ethical responsibility theories advocate for strong corporate self-restraint and\naltruism duties and expansive public policy strengthening stakeholder rights. Finally, the\ncorporate citizenship perspective invokes a political metaphor but does not discover any subset\nof ethical principles yielding corporate competitive advantage. The long-standing ethical\nresponsibility approach and the revived economic responsibility perspective hold antithetical\npremises based on competing moral frameworks and political philosophies (Windsor, 2006).\n\nA solid theoretical integration should put commercial profitability within a moral framework,\nwhich is capable of accounting for both the economic rationality and the ethical rights and\nliabilities of the firm.\n\n2.3.1 Descriptive Comparison of the Main Perspectives on the Role and\n\nResponsibilities of the Firm\nThe ethical and the economic perspectives on the role of the firm are often perceived\nas mutually exclusive with little conceptual overlay. Windsor (2006) suggested that future\nstudies should search for a theoretical integration of the utilitarian moral principles underlying\n\nthe economic perspective and the philosophical foundations of the ethical perspective, which\ndraws from the Immanuel Kant’s ideas of “duty” and “good will” and John Rawls’s theory of\njustice. The corporate citizenship perspective is most applicable to the context of the\nmultinational enterprises with global representation across different legal jurisdictions. An\n\n42\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\ninstrumental interpretation of this theory perceives social responsibility as a strategic activity\naimed at strengthening corporate political standing, building corporate reputation and\nobtaining strategic opportunities for business growth. An ideal version of the corporate\ncitizenship view evokes voluntarism and human rights arguments often without accounting\nfor the economic basis of managerial decisions (Moon et al., 2005).\nIt could be argued that the economic and the ethical perspectives share two common\nthemes. Firstly, both of them assert the importance of improving general welfare (Windsor,\n\n2006), however, in their own different interpretations. Thus, economic responsibility theories\nresting on the invisible hand of the market arguments of Adam Smith, limit organisational\nliabilities to maximising shareholder returns on capital. Instrumental corporate citizenship\ntheories also advocate against organisational responsibility to contribute to public good and\nfocus on managerial discretion in choosing corporate social policy. However, since such\n\nutilitarian approach was criticised by Friedman (1970), the economic theory has seen multiple\nattempts to rework these premises. Ethical responsibility theories and ideal corporate\ncitizenship approach emphasise contributing to social benefit as one of the organisational\nduties and protects the rights of multiple stakeholders. Secondly, both the economic and the\nethical perspectives stand for the public policy compliance (Windsor, 2006). Nonetheless, this\ndoes not substitute a unifying ethics as compliance could often constitute a practical\nprerequisite separate from moral charges. Economic responsibility theories and instrumental\ncorporate citizenship perspective advocate for limited public policy involvement and take\npolitical standing on community support as an instrument of strengthening corporate market\n\nposition. Ethical responsibility theories, on the contrary, build on the Aristotelian tradition and\nsupport extensive corporate involvement with public duties. From the economic perspective,\nit contends for inadmissibly broad social liabilities (Donaldson & Preston, 1995). Ideal\ncorporate citizenship perspective further proposes voluntary corporate altruism for fulfilment\nof fundamental human rights.\n\nThe economic and the ethical perspectives on the role of the firm substantiate\ncompeting moral frameworks and political philosophies (Windsor, 2006). Recent attempts to\nredefine the relationship between the firm and the society have led to these two frameworks\nsometimes being evaluated based on their “moral rightness,” paying little attention to the\nunderlying discussion of the purpose of the organisation. The appraisal contrasts the utilitarian\ncorporate performance focused view protecting shareholder rights and minimal public\nintervention with the altruistic corporate duties-oriented approach supporting stakeholder\nrights and extensive community involvement (Donaldson & Preston, 1995). The economic\nresponsibilities perspective supports bounded discretionary and imperative responsibilities\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n43\n\n(Friedman, 1970). From their viewpoint, in the long-term perspective the society would benefit\nfrom limited interventions in the market dominated by self-interested organisations (Jensen,\n2002). The ethical responsibility approach denies such possibility and advocates that impartial\nmoral consideration by the firm is fundamentally important for achieving socially desirable\noutcomes of corporate activities.\nThe corporate citizenship theory has often been perceived to take an intermediate\nposition between the economic and the ethical responsibilities perspectives. Though\n\ncombining certain foundations of both perspectives, this theory does not offer a satisfactory\nsynthesis sufficient for fully incorporating sustainability thinking into the theory of the firm.\nMoreover, within the corporate citizenship theory two rather conflicting interpretations could\nbe pointed out, with the instrumental citizenship reflecting the economic responsibilities\nstanding and the ideal citizenship borrowing from the ethics responsibilities approach.\n\nWindsor (2006), however, suggested that a deeper look is required on the three perspectives\nas either of the corporate citizenship framework appears to have a more pragmatic standing\nthan pure economic or ethical responsibilities approaches.\nInstrumental\n\ncitizenship\n\nframework\n\nconceptually\n\nadvances\n\nthe\n\neconomic\n\nresponsibilities approach through strategic inclusion of the organisational philanthropy (Logan\net al., 1997). In doing so, however, it deviates from the focus on maximising shareholder\nreturns but does not incorporate the value basis of the ethical approach. The application of\nstrategic philanthropy becomes pragmatic and driven by self-interested investments in the\nfirm’s reputation and market positioning. Instrumental corporate citizenship further advocates\n\nfor managerial discretion in estimating relative costs and benefits of community initiatives.\nTherefore, it also deviates from the classical economic interpretation, which claimed that\nmanagerial discretion could contradict interests of both the investors as residual risk-bearers\nand the society (Friedman, 1970). Ideal corporate citizenship conceptually advances the ethical\nresponsibilities perspective by pragmatically shifting the emphasis from corporate\n\nresponsibility to corporate reputation (Logsdon & Wood, 2002). Carroll (1995) claimed that\nthe four dimensions of corporate responsibility could also be treated as aspects of corporate\ncitizenship. Windsor (2006) further proposed that the corporate citizenship language could be\nsubstituted for corporate responsibility language without losing the moral and public policy\ncontent. The ideal corporate citizenship framework, however, advocates for greater adoption\nof the universal human rights ideas within organisations without expanding on public policy\ninvolvement, when it contradicts shareholder interests. It also restrains from using the\ncorporate responsibility rhetoric discarded by the instrumentalist perspective.\n\n44\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n2.3.2 Comparison of the Ethical and the Economic Approaches\nIn ethics, the hierarchical standing of competing moral frameworks and political\nphilosophies remains undetermined. Rorty (2000) conceptualised the current state of moral\nphilosophy as being trapped between Kant and his idea of “duties” and Dewey with his notion\nof “pragmatism”. Kagan (1989: 17-22) warned against a reduced simplistic interpretation of\nthe Kantian utilitarianism, which she believed to combine multiple distinct claims, including\n\nthose of the “moral rightness of acts”. By accepting some utilitarian principles and arguing\nwith others, the descendants of utilitarianism constructed several theories widely known as\nconsequentialism. Thus, Rachels (2007: 173) claimed that the virtue ethics is inseparable from\n“reason or practical wisdom” and focused attention on the notions of duties. He proposed that\nsets of rules have greater importance than individual acts. Kelman (1981: 38) further argued\n\nthat duties could sometimes be a stronger driver than consequences as duties have the power\nto “make an act wrong, even if it would result in an excess of benefits over costs”. The lack of\nconsensus over ethical frameworks results in similar ordering issues among the competing\napproaches to the role of the firm, leaving it solely possible to compare and contrast without\nranking.\n2.3.2.1 The Ethics of Corporate Responsibilities\nThe ethical approach to the role of the firm aims to compensate for defects of morally\nindifferent business conduct and stands for the values-conscious stakeholder relations\n\nmanagement and active participation in the community benefit creation. While incorporating\npostulates from various moral frameworks apart from utilitarianism, ethical responsibility\ntheories generally adhere to the idea of impartial moral reflection on conducting business in a\nself-restraint and altruistic manner and supporting costly community initiatives. Altruism here\nis perceived as strategic actions taken to benefit a wide range of stakeholders other than\n\nproviders of capital and actively contribute to social welfare, which should be distinguished\nfrom philanthropy understood as discretionary act of sharing corporate profits with\nstakeholders. It becomes a managerial decision to self-restrain from exploiting market\nopportunities that might have negative affect over the society or the environment.\nAs discussed in the chapter on the history of the corporate sustainability thinking, its\nethical conceptualisation went through several stages of historical development. Early\nindustrialist philanthropy views started developing already in the Gilded Age, when the\nthinking on the purpose of the firm was dominated by individualistic and opportunistic\npostulates of increasing own wealth (see Carnegie, 1900). The Progressive Era brought\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n45\n\nprogressive developments in areas of legal regulation and early scholarly contributions to the\ntopic of corporate responsibility (see Clark, 1916). The Great Depression led to the increased\npublic interest in organisational rights and liabilities, as well as the boundaries for social\nsupport and exclusion (see Kreps, 1940). In 1953, Bowen introduced his foundational work\non the ethics of corporate responsibilities, which started gaining increasing attention in the\npost-war era (Reich, 1996). He asked (1953: xi) “what responsibilities to society may\nbusinessmen reasonably be expected to assume?” Carroll (1991: 498) proposed that the firm\n\nencompasses “the economic, legal, ethical and discretionary (philanthropic) expectations that\nsociety has of organisations at a given point in time”. He conceptualised corporate\nresponsibilities as four theoretically independent but empirically interrelated components\nrather than trade-offs. Carroll (1995) further claimed that the four responsibility dimensions\nare morally infused, therefore proposing a theoretical integration of the economic and the\n\nethical approaches.\nBroad economic responsibilities to the society that permitted a firm to be created and\nsustained represent a fundamental requirement of the organisational existence. The society\nperceives firms as institutions that produce and sell goods to service the needs of their\ncommunities. Therefore, organisations generate profit when they add value to the society and\nbenefit stakeholders of the business. Focusing on their economic responsibilities, firms employ\nbusiness concepts aimed at increasing their cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency and\nprofessional concepts focused on augmenting the long-term economic growth (Carroll, 2016).\nEconomic, citizenship and ethical perspectives all admit the foundational role of the economic\n\nrole of the firm, however, assigning different importance to accounting for negative\nexternalities and contributing to positive causes. The society also establishes ground rules for\ncorporate operations expressed in laws and regulations, which reflect the “codified ethics” and\narticulate fundamental postulates of fair business practices. Firms are expected to fulfil their\nlegal obligations to social stakeholders and conduct themselves as law-abiding corporate\n\ncitizens. All three perspectives approve of the practical necessity of legal compliance,\nhowever, profoundly disagreeing on the scope and content of required state regulation, and on\nwhether civil lawsuits should be litigated or settled based on merits (Windsor, 2006).\nCarroll (1991) claimed that corporate philanthropy is desirable for the society, as well\nas some organisational stakeholders. The economic view on the role of the firm approached\nphilanthropy as discretionary altruism of noncompliant managers violating short-term\nfiduciary responsibility to shareholders or, in certain cases, as prudent altruism aimed at\npreventing public policy interventions into the market (Friedman, 1970). Instrumental\ncitizenship conceptualised philanthropy beyond prudent altruism and described it as\n\n46\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\nstrategically intended tool for fulfilling long-term fiduciary responsibilities by strengthening\ncorporate reputation and market positioning. The ethical perspective on the role of the firm\nand ideal corporate citizenship advocated the important role of organisational altruism, both\nprudent and discretionary, as “socially desirable and morally commendable” (Windsor, 2006).\nFrom the instrumental corporate citizenship perspective, organisational philanthropy could be\nbetter positioned as income allocation within economic responsibilities of the Carroll’s\nframework. While the economic perspective views all forms of discretionary corporate\n\nresponsibilities as voluntary wealth relocation away from shareholders, the ethical approach\npresents substantially deeper conceptualisation of the expansive public policy, self-restraint\napproach and corporate altruism. Carroll (1991) positioned the ethical responsibilities of the\nfirm between the mandatory economic and legal compliance and the desirable corporate\nphilanthropy. He claimed that the society and organisational stakeholders expect the firm to\n\ndemonstrate ethical attitude beyond the mandatory legal compliance. Ethical responsibilities\nview further advocated for a self-restraints approach on behalf of managers, while economic\nresponsibilities perspective suggested that managerial role should be free from making moral\nchoices that constitute the realm of public policy (Wilson, 1989).\nWood (1991) based his framework on Carroll’s (1991) multidimensional approach to\nresponsibilities of the firm and suggested that all corporate effects over general welfare should\nbe taken into account in the discussion of corporate performance. The question whether\npositive organisational contributions in one area could compensate for negative externalities\nin other dimensions, however, remained unaddressed. He also incorporated Davis’s (1960)\n\n“iron law of responsibility” and claimed that if market competition of the firms has negative\neffect over general welfare, the state should step up and increase regulatory measures. It could\nbe argued that the compound moral content and expansive public policy claims of the ethical\nperspective on the role of the firm might create obstacles for corporate managers. It could be\nfurther acknowledged that the ethical responsibilities framework is “multi-disciplinary and\n\ncomposite rather than interdisciplinary and integrated” (Windsor, 2006: 100) and offers little\nconsensus on public policy, stakeholder or management issues. The main challenge of its\npractical application, therefore, lays in a broad foundational nature of the ethical approach,\nwhich synthesises multiple ethical theories and assumes that managerial decisions should be\nattended on a case by case basis. At the same time, the ethical perspective presents a consistent\nand evident focus on impartial moral reflection around rights and responsibilities of the firm\nand the effects of its operations over the general welfare of the society.\nJensen (2002) suggested that solid interpretation, assessment and prognosis are critical\nto efficient corporate management. Marshall (1920) further claimed that economic perspective\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n47\n\non the role of the firm benefits from concise and robust deductive analysis that are absent in\nthe ethical approach. Others, however, noted that strategy is rather a process than a formula\nand management itself should be perceived not as a science but as an art (Windsor, 2006).\nMoreover, academic attempts to synthesise the economic and the ethical perspectives face\ndemands from the political perspective, which also aims to influence content of public policy\nto adopt broader or narrower stance on liabilities of the firm. The fiduciary responsibility\nframework of the economic approach, which prescribes permissive managerial judgment\n\nunder minimal state intervention, puts moral reflection and morality of the firm in general\noutside the realm of corporate management. Recent financial scandals, however, indicated that\npurely economic perspective and instrumental citizenship could lead to firms violating both\nthe fiduciary responsibility and customary business ethics.\nIn addition, Dworkin (1978) pointed to the difference between principles and rules.\n\nHe viewed the former as broad and obscure notions hierarchically ordered by relative weights\nand the latter as narrow and precise functional orders. When taken as a rigid rule, the ethical\nperspective on the role of the firm might appear ambiguous and short of logical rigour due to\nits nature of a broad foundational principle. Recent theoretical developments, however,\nsuggested that narrow economic or instrumentalist approaches appear insufficient for guiding\nthe firm in modern society that keeps strengthening its focus on social and environmental\ndimensions of corporate performance. Moral concerns have become an indispensable part of\nmanagerial work and general welfare considerations often act superior to legal boundaries and\nfiduciary responsibility. A conflict between the fiduciary responsibility and the social\n\nresponsibility occurs when financial and social outcomes become counterbalanced and a\nwelfare transfer between the firm and the society is required. Ethical advice to instrumentalist\nmanagers, however, remains situational and draws upon evaluation of the relative effects of\ncorporate activity over financial and general welfare outcomes.\n\n2.3.2.2 The Economics of Corporate Responsibilities\nThe economic responsibilities perspective on the role of the firm largely does not\nprescribe any ethical liabilities for the firm other than protecting shareholder property rights.\nAs described by Adam Smith (1776, Book Four, Ch. 8), consumption serves as a utilitarian\n\npurpose of corporate performance and sufficient contribution to social welfare: “Consumption\nis the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be\nattended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer”. This\nutilitarian premise suggests that the society as a whole will benefit from operations of efficient\n\n48\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\norganisations in competitive markets. It could be claimed that, while protecting the rights of\ncorporate shareholders, the economic perspective sees them as subordinate to the welfare of\nsociety as a whole (Windsor, 2006). This position differs from the instrumental citizenship\napproach, which perceives social welfare contributions as a strategic opportunity for\nstrengthening corporate standing. Therefore, though utilitarianism incorporates the\nconsequentialist thinking and some of its interpretations discuss the general social welfare\n(Wood, 1991), such synthesis is not sufficient to bridge the differences between the two ends\n\nof the dichotomy. The economic and the ethical perspectives on the role of the firm remain as\n“competing moral frameworks linked to competing political philosophies” (Windsor, 2006).\nThe economic responsibilities approach advocates that firms ought not to undertake any\nliabilities other than to maximise shareholder profit. According to this framework,\norganisational liabilities should be determined by the state public policy regulation, which\n\nmight be complemented by customary business ethics. Therefore, the debate between the\neconomic and the ethical perspectives unfolds around the inclusion of moral component and\nthe scope of public policy.\nThe economic thinking on the role of the firm has its foundations in the works of\nAdam Smith and his thesis that stronger economic performance is linked to the discretional\ncapital allocation for shareholder profit maximisation within relatively independent and\ncompetitive markets with minimal public policy: “Without any intervention of law, therefore,\nthe private interests and passions of men naturally lead them to divide and distribute the stock\nof every society among all the different employments carried on in it as nearly as possible in\n\nthe proportion which is most agreeable to the interest of the whole society” (Smith, 1776,\nBook 4, Ch. 7, Par. 3). Smith’s postulates suggested a link between the profit-focused\ncorporate strategy and the enhancement of social welfare through the mechanism of the\ninvisible hand of the market. Proponents of his theory further claimed that state interventions,\nas well as corporate altruism, should be avoided as they could cause unforeseen negative\n\nexternalities. Nonetheless, they admitted the importance of clear minimal regulation for\nachieving socially desirable outcomes.\nFriedman (1970) advocated for minimal state regulation of the market aimed at\nensuring fair competition that is believed to contribute to the greater general welfare. Smith\n(1776, Book 1, Ch. 10, Par. 82) pointed to the similar tendency of organisations to monopolise\nmarkets in the absence of state regulation: “People of the same trade seldom meet together,\neven for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public,\nor in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any\nlaw which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice”. Hence,\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n49\n\nhe emphasised the importance of moral rules and impartial moral reflection for protecting free\nmarket from such corporate behaviour flaws. Friedman (1970) further did not support the ideas\nof corporate altruism and focused on fiduciary responsibility of the firm based on the central\npostulate that economic value generation unavoidably leads to improvements in social welfare.\nTherefore, firms should follow minimal state guidance on competitive market behaviour, and\nmoral reflections of corporate management should be reduced to customary business ethics.\nFriedman, however, endorsed an instrumental case for corporate altruism where it is aimed at\n\npreventing the enlargement of public policy. According to his theorising, the ethical\nresponsibilities postulate lacked logical precision and appeared generally vague. Other\nscholars, such as Jones (1995) later also pointed to certain ambiguity and logical inconsistency\nof some stakeholder theory and corporate citizenship postulates.\nThe revived economic perspective (Jensen, 2002; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001),\n\nextended moral postulates of the utilitarian economics to include responses to the growing\nnumber of claims from multiple stakeholder groups. Jensen (2002) proposed that firms should\npursue long-term wealth creation opportunities to achieve sustainable value growth rather than\nfocus on short-term profit generation. He suggested that accounting for claims from a broader\nrange of stakeholders might contribute positively to increasing employees’ productivity.\nNonetheless, the revived economic perspective still advocated for the priority of fiduciary\nliability towards capital providers within the existing legal framework and customary business\nethics. It supported resource allocation aimed at maximising shareholder profits and\nconsidered pursuing other causes based on ethical considerations as “discretionary altruism by\n\nmanagement at investors’ expense” (Windsor, 2006). Friedman (1970) claimed that\ndiscretionary corporate altruism negatively affects the market by eliminating distinctions\nbetween public and private actions. McWilliams and Siegel (2001) further proposed that the\nfirm should respond to claims of stakeholders only to the extent that customers are willing to\npay for such initiatives. The revived economic responsibilities approach, therefore, remained\n\nconsistent with the ideas of Friedman. It was predominantly targeted at analysing the\nbehaviour of large publicly traded corporations in a capitalist market economy with minimal\nstate intervention for ensuring fair competition and provision of general welfare. The revived\neconomic perspective on the role of the firm supported market deregulation and shareholder\nfreedom in maximising private wealth, however, advocated for a more instrumental definition\nof the fiduciary responsibility and longer planning horizons (Jensen, 2002). Its stance on\nprudent altruism appeared more flexible and reflected the growing expectations on the firm’s\nliabilities from corporate stakeholders and society as a whole.\n\n50\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\nMarshall (1920: 759) suggested that the economic perspective on the role of the firm\naims to logically link propositions with the outcomes in its empirical interpretations of\neconomic problems that more often appear as sets of mutually determining elements rather\nthan chains of causation (Windsor, 2006: 105): “Economic language seems technical and less\nreal than that of common life. But in truth it is more real, because it is more careful and takes\nmore account of differences and difficulties”. It could be further claimed that while the ethical\nperspective grapples with the theoretical complexity in its discussion on the role of the firm,\n\nthe economic approach tends to abstract from it. Even from a strictly economic perspective,\nnegative externalities of organisational activities harming social welfare result in costs for\nshareholders. However, the economic approach and instrumental citizenship proposed that\ninternalising the costs for production side effects reduces financial performance of the firm\nand suggested that the affected parties should be compensated through social welfare.\n\nTherefore, they advocated for the fiduciary responsibility rule of the classic economic theory.\nThey argued that firms should not discretionally take these liabilities beyond their legal\ncompliance. However, even in the absence of public policy or moral constraints, the growing\npressure from stakeholders often pushes organisations to internalise such externalities. In order\nto regulate liabilities for negative externalities, broader public policy and ethical\nconsiderations by management become desirable for firms. By extension it could be claimed\nthat the economic perspective signals desirability of moral reflection on organisational\nliabilities in the absence of strong public policy (Windsor, 2006).\n\n2.3.3 Implications for Research on Sustainable Finance and Banking\nAdam Smith (1776, Book 4, Ch. 7, Par. 3) in his discussions of the East India\nCompany proposed that the sole focus on shareholder profit maximisation is likely to lead to\ncorporate conspiracies against public interest. Following the trends of the late twentieth\ncentury towards market liberalism, privatisation and competition, recent scandals in the\nfinancial sector brought back the discussion on moral grounds and ethical commitments of\nfirms and their managers. These developments led to span in the discussion of the role of the\nfirm in society and further delineation of competing explanations from the economic, the\nethical and the corporate citizenship perspectives. Both the ethical approach and shareholder\n\nwealth maximisation theory have been criticised for their supposed inability to adequately\ncapture new market tendencies and provide corporate managers with effective tools for\ncontributing to general welfare. Moreover, the growing significance of multinational\nenterprises (MNEs) in the global economy supported the development of the corporate\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n51\n\ncitizenship discourse, which incorporates many ideas from the economic and the ethical\napproaches, as well as a political metaphor. This metaphor changed the vector of the role of\nthe firm discussion and was often perceived as an attempt to find a middle ground between the\neconomic and the ethical perspectives.\nWhile individuals are natural citizens of a state, corporations could be perceived as\nartificial citizens (Windsor, 2006) that have both rights and liabilities. Adam Smith (1759:\n339) associated prudent citizenship with self-restraint and altruistic behaviour spreading\n\nbeyond personal benefits: “He is not a citizen who is not disposed to respect the laws and obey\nthe civil magistrate; and he is certainly not a good citizen who does not wish to promote, by\nevery means in his power, the welfare of the whole society of his fellow-citizens”. The existing\ntheories have not reached consensus on whether artificial citizens should possess equal rights\nand responsibilities to natural citizens. The idealised corporate citizenship guided by the\n\nAristotelian ethics advocated for firms carrying a greater burden of moral duties. The\ninstrumental approach, on the contrary, viewed corporate citizenship as a tool to obtain\nbenefits and avoid costs, and perceived contributions to social welfare as strategic investments\nin corporate reputation and market opportunities.\nRecent financial scandals substantially affected the course of the role of the firm\ndebates, drawing attention to problems of supporting legal boundaries with business ethics and\nstakeholder responsibility ideas. On the one hand, a tendency appeared to increase market\nregulation and strictly determine fiduciary responsibilities (Palepu & Healy, 2003). On the\nother hand, a second trend could be noticed to increase corporate voluntarism. Thus, in 2001\n\nthe European Commission introduced the Green Paper on corporate responsibilities to account\nfor liabilities of firms within the European Union through consultations with various\nstakeholder groups on discretionary ways to address them in the absence of the developed\nregulation. Furthermore, the UN Global Club represented another effort to grow corporate\nparticipation in multilateral initiatives on human rights, labour rights and environmental\n\nsustainability. Even though these approaches fall in line with the framework of the\ninstrumental citizenship, they represent a sustained effort to raise standards of business\nconduct to meet high ethical criteria prescribed by the ideal corporate citizenship.\nJones (1995) summarised a number of attempts to develop a widely accepted\nparadigm or integrating framework from the fields of business and society. He discussed\nseveral integrating attempts including the corporate social performance, the social control of\nbusiness and the stakeholder frameworks. Jones (1995) suggested that the instrumental\nstakeholder approach has the potential to synthesise important postulates from the economic\nand the ethical views of the firm. He proposed a formal instrumental theory of stakeholder\n\n52\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\nmanagement, which he believed to be a synthesis of “the stakeholder concept, economic\ntheory, insights from behavioural science, and ethics” (Ibid: 404). This framework discussed\nthe nature of contracting through the analysis of the agency and the transactions cost theories\nand emphasised the role of ethics in efficient contracting developed. Jones (1995) proposed\nthat voluntary adoption of moral behavioural standards by firms has great potential to limit or\neliminate opportunistic behaviour, as mutual cooperation between agents and principals will\nreduce opportunism and, consequently, transaction costs. He further advocated that\n\nincorporation of good ethics in contracting relationships, such as trust, trustworthiness,\ncooperativeness or other attributes highly valued by organisational stakeholders, could be\nbeneficial for the competitive market positioning of the firm.\nEconomists and moral philosophers since Adam Smith have been suggesting that free\ncompetitive market functions more effectively when market participants share basic\n\nfundamental values of honesty and integrity. Thus, North (1981: 19) claimed that “the absence\nof some degree of individual restraint from maximising behaviour would render the political\nor economic institution nonviable”. This idea of shared values could also be associated with\nFriedman’s (1970) framework of customary business ethics and applied to the discussion of\nthe relative efficiency of state interventions into the market and self-restraint altruism of\ncorporations (Windsor, 2006). Voluntary attempts of firms to build trust with their\nstakeholders lead to mutual cooperation and reinforcement of positive behaviour among\npartners involved in the transaction, therefore, contributing to greater reliability and lower\nopportunism of all market participants. Jones (1995: 430) applied these insights to discussing\n\ncorporate social performance, a concept closely related to corporate responsibility and\nsustainability, which he proposed to view as “the contracting relationship rather than particular\nbehaviour”.\nJones’s proposal, therefore, was based on the premise of trustworthy behaviour on\nbehalf of both agents and principals, who are guided by instrumental rather than moral\n\nconsiderations. It focused on the instrumental assessment of competitive advantages that a\nfirm could acquire from meeting ethical demands of its stakeholders and did not rely on the\nimpartial moral reflection from managers. The instrumental citizenship appeared socially\nsatisfactory in cases when it is aimed at contributing positively to general welfare. However,\nit does not have inbuilt mechanisms of preventing firms from sliding into misconduct. Dodd\n(1932) criticised multi-principal approach to discretionary agent duties and advocated for\nstrong reinforcement mechanisms for protecting the legal rights of stakeholders. Likewise,\nPreston and Post (1975) proposed that corporate responsibilities cannot be decided by\nmanagerial discretion and should be defined by the state welfare policy. Recent corporate\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n53\n\nscandals in the financial sector supported the argument that no agent can objectively represent\nseveral constituencies and should, therefore, operate as a trustee of public interest (Windsor,\n2006).\nManagement practices prior to the recent financial crisis have been predominantly\nguided by the focus on shareholder profit maximisation due to the three main reasons. Firstly,\nshareholder wealth maximisation strategies have proven to have enormous success in the\nmarket allowing MNEs maintaining disproportionately large share of the global capital. This\n\nstrengthened market trust in the superiority of the fiduciary responsibility argument in\nachieving capital growth, however, leaving unattended the question of distributing the\nresulting wealth to contribute to general welfare. Secondly, market deregulation and\nprivatisation have been dominant global trends in search of market efficiency, which in cases\nof lack of the state regulation and enforcement mechanisms created incentives for corporate\n\nmisconduct. Finally, many scholars have pointed to the role of business education in\npromoting utilitarian wealth maximisation ideology based on the economic approach\npostulates of the market liberty, property rights and minimal welfare policy (Pfeffer & Fong,\n2004; Starkey et al., 2004). Recent corporate scandals draw attention to the limitations of the\neconomic approach to the role of the firm and brought back the question about the ethical\ncomponent of managerial discretion.\nThese recent developments had considerable effect on the debate of the role of the\nfirm in society and attempts to find a middle ground between the economic and the ethical\napproaches. The economic responsibilities framework excludes discussions of the moral side\n\nof market participants solely expecting them to fulfil their fiduciary responsibility.\nConsequently, economic actors cannot be trusted to objectively represent the interests of their\nprincipals or ensure the maximisation of social welfare. Ethical responsibilities perspective,\non the contrary, expects all market participants to engage in impartial moral reflection, which\ncould be otherwise reinforced through the expansive public policy. The corporate citizenship\n\nperspective partakes these premises proportionally to whether one follows the instrumental or\nthe ideal framework (Windsor, 2006). Its proponents suggested that the focus should be moved\nfrom the fiduciary responsibility of managers not to the managerial discretion, which often\ncauses agentic misconduct, but to the ways of incorporating moral reflection into the existing\npractice and instances where corporations must contribute to social welfare. Therefore,\ncorporate citizenship affirms that ethical liabilities of the firm are “a legally and socially\ndesirable buffer between market selfishness and expansive public policy” (Ibid: 110).\nMoreover, Adam Smith proposed that the growth in corporate wealth should lead to a greater\ncompassion in the market, which could be further reinforced by ethical education (Ghoshal,\n\n54\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n2003). Carroll also suggested that moral behaviour of market participants creates conditions\nfor shifting the emphasis from the fiduciary responsibility of the firm to the moral reflection.\nThe conflict between the economic and the ethical approaches to the role of the firm\ncould be perceived as the dichotomy between the fiduciary responsibility rule and the broad\ncorporate responsibilities ethics, which appears ambitious due to the lack of clear\nconceptualisation of organisational rights and duties as either hierarchical or evened. While\nthe fiduciary responsibility describes relationships between agents and principals, it offers\n\nlittle insight on conflicts between profit maximisation goals and illicit damage to stakeholder\ninterests. The discussion on corporate responsibilities unfolds around principal–principal\nrelations, where the society is perceived as a superior principal (Windsor, 2006). Corporate\nsocial responsibilities (CSR) theory (Carroll, 1991; Jones, 1995) further stated that in the\nsituations of impairment of legal or ethical rights of stakeholders, they should be treated\n\nsuperior to corporate shareholder interests. In the sustainable finance and banking theory this\nfoundational premise often appeared weaker in comparison with logical and lawful rule of the\nfiduciary responsibility, when applied to corporate strategy. The theoretical struggle concerns\nlegal and political dimensions of the role of the firm, such as socially embedded values, power\nrelations and opinions on public interest, and related arguments about wealth maximisation,\nstakeholder satisfaction and strategic philanthropy (Windsor, 2006).\nDespite the growing stakeholder claims for extended corporate responsibilities and\ntheoretical and practical recognition of those claims, lack of satisfactory synthesis of the\neconomic and the ethical perspectives remained the main obstacle for developing the corporate\n\nresponsibilities discourse. Many scientists pointed to the importance of keeping the\nmultiplicity of perspectives and contradicting research streams and traditions for both\nacademic and managerial purposes. Economics as a science focuses upon rigorous logic\nconfirmed by empirical tests and typically limits the discussion of moral judgement to private\nvalues and public policy. Moral philosophy, on the contrary, while keeping both logical and\n\nempirical grounds, makes claims about the right and wrong of business conduct. CSR\nframework examines “moral rights of individuals in relationship to businesses and moral\nduties of businesses in relationship to social outcomes” (Windsor, 2006). Friedman (1970)\nperceived discretionary CSR exercised by managers and shareholders as socially dangerous\ndue to its similarities with the socialist thinking. Fuchs et al. (1997) proclaimed that many\nmisalignments among the economic theories are concerned with values and limits. They\nperceived the economic perspective on the role of the firms a science of markets and\ninstitutions and a doctrine of corporate relations with the government and with the society.\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n55\n\nTherefore, neither the economic nor the ethical perspectives are free of value judgements or\npractical content.\nIt could be summarised that contemporary scholarship developed little basis for the\ntheoretical synthesis of the economic and the ethical perspectives on the role of the firm. In\nboth “The Theory of Moral Sentiments” (1759) and “The Wealth of Nations” (1776), Adam\nSmith apprehended an important function of the moral reflection for the firm. He proposed the\nnotion of an impartial spectator, whose role is to objectively evaluate the market situation\n\naccounting for both personal and public interests. Smith (1759) further suggested that ethical\nand economic considerations should be jointly implemented in practice with the former\nunderlying the latter. At the same time, Smith (1776) predicted that economic motives would\ncommonly prevail in the market behaviour of the firm and still suggested that economics\nshould take ethical norms into account. Economic approach to the role of the firm still\n\nmaintains its analytical distance from ethics mainly focusing on general welfare. Smith’s\nstatement regarding the market security and justice as foundational requirements for the fair\ncompetition were further developed by Jones (1995), however, his stance on public policy and\nmoral reflection remained rather narrow.\n\n2.4 Synthesised Approach to the Role of the Firm as the Economic and the\nEthical Actor\nFrom the economic perspective, the purpose of the financial services organisations is\nto create value for their beneficiaries. While they may have goals around developing the\ncommunities in which they are embedded, they remain governed by the commercial banking\ninstitutional logic, which prescribes profit maximisation through commercial operations as\ntheir primary performance objective (Jensen, 2002; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Under the\neconomic perspective, financial performance remains the main anchor for liability within the\nfinancial services institutions. On the contrary, organisations governed by the ethical\nperspective on the role of the firm aim to serve public rather than private interests and advance\nthe community prosperity through their operations (Carroll, 1991; Wood, 1991). Therefore,\nliabilities in these organisations focus on fulfilling their social mission through serving the\ncommunity (Dossa, 2013). Consequently, their success is measured in terms of progress\ntowards fulfilling their social mission. Organisations governed by ethical goals typically\nrepresent the non-profit organisational form with limitations around profit and assets\ndistribution, which is aimed to prevent any form of equity financing or ownership that could\ncompromise the public purpose for private gains (Fishman, 2003).\n\n56\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\nDespite the long admitted conceptual possibility to synthesise the economic and the\nethical approaches to the role of the firm, limited perspectives managed to present a balance\nview and apply it to organisational practice. Previous literature acknowledged that sustainable\nbanks perceive themselves as the economic and the ethical actors based on their simultaneous\ncommitment to the community development and the financial profitability goals (Dossa, 2013;\nEbrahim e al., 2014). As such, sustainable banks have been previously conceptualised as\nhybrid organisations that combine both business and non-profit aspects at their core (Battilana\n& Lee, 2014; Besharov & Smith, 2014; Ebrahim et al., 2014). The hybridity discussion mainly\nevolved around micro-finance organisations that aim to extend financial services to previously\nexcluded individuals and organisations, thereby, helping lift them out of poverty.\nThe existing theory further distinguished between the two ideal types of hybrid\norganisations based on the degree of integration between the economics related and the ethics\nrelated sets of activities (Battilana & Lee, 2014; Lee, 2014; Ebrahim et al., 2014). The first\ntype referred to as integrated hybrids, fulfil their organisational mission by integrating\nbeneficiaries as customers and meeting their needs throughout the same set of activities. The\nsecond type, differentiated hybrids, represents a case where the community development\nactivities are kept separate from the commercial ones. Therefore, customers and beneficiaries\nin differentiated hybrids refer to two different groups of stakeholders. The income created by\nthe commercial activities is used to support the community development activities targeted at\nthe organisational beneficiaries who are not the primary customers of the goods or services.\nEbrahim et al. (2014) claimed that micro-finance organisations represent the integrated model\nas they pursue their community development goals by providing loans to their beneficiaries\nwho are at the same time their customers. Therefore, their main activities simultaneously\nenable them both to fulfil their ethical role and to generate profit to sustain their operations.\nOther types of sustainable finance and banking organisations, however, have not been\nexplored from the hybridity perspective and might represent an integrated as well as a\ndifferentiated form.\nIn addition to adhering to demands from multiple performance goals stopping from\norganisational understanding of its role in society as having both the economic and the ethical\nresponsibilities, sustainable banks face liabilities to multiple principal stakeholders (Ebrahim\net al., 2014). The problem of multiple principal stakeholders is not unique to sustainable banks,\nbut it is arguably more profound than in conventional financial institutions or non-profit\norganisations. The problem sustainable banks face is how to align inconsistent interests of\nmultiple stakeholders, who are the demanders of the economic and the ethical responsibilities,\nand how to prioritise their interest if they come into conflict. The conventional banks,\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n57\n\nrepresenting the economic approach to the role of the firm, are liable to multiple stakeholder\ngroups, including investors, depositors and borrowers. On top of it, they face demands from\nother institutional actors, such as the government, financial regulators, industry groups, local\ncommunities and NGOs (Austin & Ebrahim, 2010). According to the stakeholder theory\n(Donaldson & Preston, 1995; Freeman, 1984), organisations prioritise among stakeholder\ngroups according to their power, legitimacy and urgency of their claims. The agency theory\n(Eisenhardt, 1989a) suggested that the interests of organisational owners or shareholders\nassume primacy over those of other stakeholder groups. Furthermore, both theories claimed\nthat greater value results from the alignment of interests, so organisations are more likely to\nassign greater importance to interests of other stakeholders if they are material to the\norganisational performance (Jensen & Meckling, 1976; Jones, 1995). Studies of non-profit\norganisations, governed by the ethical approach to the role of the firm, on the contrary,\nreported on a persistent tension between liability towards the owners of key resources, such\nas donors, powerful foundations and governments, and towards the beneficiaries, who\ncommonly have less power despite attending to their needs constituting the mission of a nonprofit organisation (Ben-Ner, 2002; O’Dwyer & Unerman, 2008). The existing literature\nhighlighted the potential conflict of interest between these groups (or at least divergence of\ninterests) and an implied tension at the organisational level between “upward accountability”\ndemands of powerful donors and “downward accountability” toward beneficiaries (Edwards\n& Hulme, 1996).\nHybrid approach to the role of organisation removes the need for hierarchical\nprioritisation of the community development and the financial profitability goals, therefore\nproviding a solid basis for synthesising the economic and the ethical approaches to the role of\nthe firm. It also orientates organisations towards incorporating multiple stakeholder claims\nbased on parameters other than power, legitimacy and urgency, as was suggested by the\nexisting theories of the firm. This research adopts hybrid approach to the role of the firm in an\nattempt to synthesis the economic and the ethical perspectives. In organisational studies, the\nconcept of hybridity started with the premise that organisations are products of a prevailing\nsocial context and do not exist independent of it. Thus, Meyer and Rowan (1977: 345) claimed\nthat “the building blocks for organisations come to be littered around the societal landscape;\nit takes only a little entrepreneurial energy to assemble them into a structure”.\nLiteratures on organisational identity (Albert & Whetten, 1985; Glynn, 2000; Pratt &\nRafaeli, 1997), organisational forms (Hannan & Freeman, 1986; Polos et al., 2002) and\ninstitutional logics (Besharov & Smith, 2016; Greenwood et al., 2011; Pache & Santos, 2010)\nhave made theoretical contributions to the discussion of organisational hybridity. While these\n\n58\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\nperspectives have rarely spoken to each other directly, Battilana and Lee (2014) proposed that\nthey offer complementary insights into the ways firms experience hybridity. Discussions of\nhybridity from the perspectives of organisational identity, organisational form and institutional\nlogics have been often reported to present largely convergent insights, despite having evolved\nfrom different streams of organisational theory. This study focuses on the concept of\norganisational identity, which in its turn is based upon institutional logics and organisational\nforms that provide the “cultural materials that organisational members assemble” (Glynn,\n2008: 426). The next chapter will discuss the notion of organisational identity and its\ncontributions to the discussion of organisations that combine the economic and the ethical\nviews on the role of the firm.\n\n2.5 Chapter Summary\nThis chapter provided an overview of the major theories of the firm and their\ncontributions to sustainability discourse. Building on the studies of Seth and Thomas (1994)\nand Lozano et al. (2015), it conceptualised theories of the firm along three directions: (1)\ncorporate entity or personality perspective, which focuses on the establishment of firm as a\nlegal person; (2) corporate nature perspective, which analysis the reasons of firm existence\nand its relations with other constituencies; and (3) corporate obligations perspective, which\ndiscusses organisational responsibilities in society. It further discussed the ethical and the\neconomic approaches to the role of the firm. The former advocates for the extended\norganisational responsibilities to contribute to the general welfare, whereas the latter supports\nthe priority of the shareholders’ interests. The chapter discussed the current state of the debates\non the role of the firm and their implications for research on sustainable finance and banking\norganisations.\nIn addition, the chapter addressed previous calls for finding a common theoretical\nground between the economic and the ethical perspectives. It critically analysed the existing\ndiscussions on the economic and the ethical approaches to the role of the firm and presented\nthe pluralistic identity organisation theory, which was suggested as a viable attempt to\nsynthesise the opposing perspectives. When applied to sustainable finance and banking\norganisations, pluralistic identity organisation approach to the role of the firm allows to avoid\nthe hierarchical prioritisation of the community development and the financial profitability\ngoals. The chapter further discussed that, although plurality has been previously\nconceptualised in terms of organisational identities, organisational forms and institutional\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\n59\n\nlogics, this thesis will focus on the notion of organisational identity, which will be thoroughly\ndiscussed in the following chapter.\n\n60\n\nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND BANKING THEORY\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nPLURALISTIC ORGANISATIONAL IDENTITY IN\nBANKS:\nIdentity, Orientation and Research Agenda\n\n3.1 Introduction\nFollowing up on the role of the firm discussion from Chapter 2, the conceptual\npossibility to synthesise the economic and the ethical perspectives is further discussed here.\nThe study focuses on the theoretical implications of combining organisational roles of the\neconomic and the ethical actor for the identity of the firm. The concept of organisational\nidentity is introduced and the main theoretical conceptualisations of identity plurality as a way\nto capture the “hybrid” role of the firm as an economic and an ethical actor are compared and\ncontrasted. Thus, the chapter provides a detailed overview of the hybrid identity theory (Albert\n& Whetten, 1985; Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Foreman & Whetten, 2002; Glynn, 2000;\nGolden-Biddle & Rao, 1997) and the multiple identities theory (Corley, 2004; Pratt &\nForeman, 2000; Pratt & Kraatz, 2009; Sillince & Brown, 2009). It further analyses the\nimplications of identity plurality research for sustainable finance and banking organisations\nand discusses internal and external liabilities of identity plurality for the firm.\n\n3.2 The Concept of Organisational Identity\nThe notion of identity has extensive conceptual reach. Previous research has shown\nthat it can shape, sustain and steer collectives in the similar manner as it does individuals\n(Albert & Whetten, 1985; Brickson, 2005; Corley & Gioia, 2004; Dutton & Dukerich, 1991;\nForeman & Whetten, 2002; Gioia et al., 2000; Hatch & Schultz, 2002; Patvardhan et al., 2015).\nOrganisational identity is the members' collective, shared sense of who they are as an\norganisation (Albert & Whetten, 1985; Stimpert et al., 1998). It represents insiders' central\nperceptions and beliefs about what distinguishes their organisation from others and provides\na foundation for presenting the organisation to external audiences (Hatch & Schultz, 2002). In\ntheir original work defining the concept, Albert and Whetten (1985) conceptualised\norganisational identity as those characteristics collectively understood by an organisation's\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n61\n\nmembers to be central, distinctive and enduring. These defining aspects are presumably stable\nand resistant to attempts at alteration because of their strong connection to the organisation's\nfoundation and history. Although Albert and Whetten acknowledged that identity might\nchange, they also argued that change occurs slowly and over long periods of time.\nIn line with Albert and Whetten’s (1985) seminal work, Pratt and Foreman (2000: 20)\ndescribed organisational identity as consisting of “those attributes that members feel are\nfundamental to (central) and uniquely descriptive of (distinctive) the organisation and that\npersist within the organisation over time (enduring).” Organisational identity is about the selfdefinition of a collective (Pratt, Schultz, Ashforth, & Ravasi, 2016) and as such is\n“fundamentally a reflexive, self-referential, self-defined concept” (Gioia, Price, Hamilton, &\nThomas, 2010: 34). Explaining how an organisation is both similar and different from others\n(Pratt et al., 2016), organisational identity is relational and comparative in nature (Foreman &\nWhetten, 2016). Moreover, as a central organising characteristic, identity affects how strategic\nissues and problems are addressed, making it a key intangible element in any organisation\n(Glynn, 2000).\nAs other scholars have observed (Whetten, 2006; Whetten & Godfrey, 1998), it took\nsome time for the organisational identity concept to attract interest from organisational\nresearchers (Gioia & Thomas, 1996; Golden-Biddle & Rao, 1997). In the past few decades,\nthe topic has been featured in an increasing number of organisational studies, which generated\nsome vivid ontological (Gioia & Hamilton, 2016) and epistemological (Gioia et al., 2013)\ndebates, helped explore different interpretations and applications of the notion (Dutton et al.,\n1994; Reger et al., 1994), as well as its interrelation with other related concepts (Gioia et al.\n2000; Hatch & Schultz, 1997). In the existing literature, the origins of organisational identity\nhave been most often derived from the expression of founders’ values (Hannan et al., 2006;\nRodrigues & Child, 2008; Scott & Lane, 2000), organisational form (Hsu & Elsbach, 2013;\nPólos et al., 2002), industry membership (Rao et al., 2000) or other processes that have not\nbeen adequately studied (Gioia et al., 2010).\nOrganisational identity scholars have a long-standing tradition of confining the notion\nof identity with an “entity” status and ascribing to it facets and attributes that make identity\n“substantive” (Watson, 2016). Recently, academics started posing the question of whether\norganisational identity is substantive at its core and should be studied as an entity or more\nethereal and could be better captured as an ongoing dynamic process. The first approach treats\norganisational identity as a substantive entity, whose essence could be captured in a set of key\nattributes. The dominant presumption within this “content” discourse is that identity could be\nperceived as static in character and therefore described through a set of key features associated\n\n62\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\nwith the entity. Proponents of this view suggest that multiple attributes may be ascribed to the\norganisation through the process of constructing organisational identity, and those attributes\ncould be complementary, supplementary or competing (Glynn, 2000; Golden-Biddle & Rao,\n1997; Seo & Creed, 2002).\nThe second approach, on the contrary, puts emphasis on mutability and dynamism of\norganisational identity. It argues that identity is a fluid concept and, therefore, could be better\ncaptured in more vibrant processual terms. Supporters of the process view on organisational\nidentity advocated for conceptualising the notion in terms of “flow”, “narrative” or “work” –\nthat is, as something continually under construction (Schultz et al., 2012). Scholars within this\nstream of research suggested that the character of organisational identity does not reside in\ntangibles and observables, and attributes and practices might only act as manifestations and\nsigns of identity. The processual view of organisational identity is supported by William\nJames’ old observation that, “What really exists is not things made but things in the making”\n(1909/2014: 352). Other scholars continued this line of thinking, suggesting that\norganisational identity is an inherently dynamic notion that might be better conceived as a\n“thing in the making”, rather than a “thing made” (Gioia & Hamilton, 2016). Gioia and\nPatvardhan (2012) further claimed that refocusing attention on organisational identity as\nprocess and flow could help highlight the parts of it that “might be seen but not noticed”, as\nwas pointed out by Henri Bergson in his essays on the creative mind in 1946.\nThe construction of identities, which could be understood as the processes through\nwhich actors in and around organisations involve in process of constructing, negotiating,\nperforming, reconstructing and legitimating organisational identity, remains a critically\nimportant topic within the organisational studies (Corley et al., 2006; Czarniawska-Joerges,\n1994; Gioia et al., 2010; Lerpold et al., 2012). As I mentioned in the previous chapters,\nresearch has explored organisational identity as both a fairly stable set of characteristics\n(Albert & Whetten, 1985) and as a negotiated process (Gioia et al., 2010) and has provided\nconsiderable evidence to support either view. Therefore, “both-and” framing could be\nbeneficial to ensure a more comprehensive understanding of organisational identity (Ashforth\n& Reingen, 2014; Clark et al., 2010; Clegg et al., 2007; Hatch & Schultz, 2002). Attributefocused descriptions of identity are best suited to capture the main features that members\nconsider to be essential to the conception of their collectives, while the process-focused\napproach helps develop a sense of the continuous, ongoing process of identity as a set of\nenactments and accomplishments. In this thesis, I would like to acknowledge recent trends\ngravitating towards adopting a more “both-and” approach and demonstrate how the\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n63\n\nsustainable banking identity is experienced as both a characteristic and a process by the GABV\nbanks.\nSchultz et al. (2012) advocated that putting the process approach at the basis of\norganisational identity research does not imply denying the existence of content but shifting\nemphasis to the processes involved in the construction of organisational identity. Gioia &\nHamilton (2016) further suggested that in order to reconcile the paradox of organisational\nidentity as simultaneously the content and the process, the notion could be better expressed as\na gerund rather than a noun. Gerunds as nouns in form and verbs in function strongly suggest\na view of identity as a set of ongoing accomplishments that are either repeatedly affirmed or\nincrementally adjusted. Gerunds help portray the identity formation and change as a kind of\ndynamic “performing art,” rather than a static “fine art” (Gioia & Hamilton, 2016: 13). This\nthesis follows their advice and approaches organisational identity in the gerund form to\ncombine the content and the process views. Proponents of the content approach to\norganisational identity drew from Albert and Whetten’s (1985) classic definition of the notion\nas the distinctive, core and enduring features of an organisation, pointing to the continuity and\ncohesion emphasised in their early conceptualisation. Other scholars, however, suggested that\nthere are processes to be studied even if we widely agree that identities are enduring. Thus,\nCardador and Pratt (2006) articulated three bases for incorporating process thinking into\norganisational identity studies: behavioural (Lerpold et al., 2012; Pratt & Foreman, 2000),\nrelational (Porac et al., 1989; Whetten, 2006) and symbolic (Brown, 2006; CzarniawskaJoerges, 1994). These bases correspond to the fundamental elements of organisational identity\nconstruction, which Pratt (2012) conceptualised as doing, acting and interacting and Schultz\net al. (2012) as interactions, associations and conversations.\nThe first, behavioural, component of organisational identity suggests that identity\nforms in the act of doing or in practice (Lerpold et al., 2012). Similarly, structural symbolic\ninteractionists discuss the importance of roles, which are organised around behaviours, to\nidentity formation. While some treatments of the role are relatively static, research (Turner,\n1981) has also emphasised agency and action by focusing not only on role-taking (adopting\nroles), but also on role-making (modifying roles). Thus, it could be claimed that identity\nresearchers have a long tradition of studying cognitive or social structures as dynamic. More\nrecently, process-oriented researchers of organisational identity, interested in studying identity\nwork, noted the importance of the process of “doing, acting and interacting” (Pratt, 2012).\nThus, at the micro level, Pratt et al. (2006) looked at how individuals develop professional\nidentities through working and how these identities are contested and validated at the\nworkplace. Authors concluded that the process of identity construction involves both “acting”\n\n64\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\nand “reacting” with other stakeholders in the social environment. Similarly, previous research\nat the organisational level reported that organisational identities are constructed through\narticulating visions, negotiating and contesting identity claims, achieving consensus on\nmeanings, attaining optimal distinctiveness and legitimising identity claims with stakeholders\n(Gioia et al., 2010; ). In other words, it could be agreed that existing research has put “doing”\nat the foundation of identity formation both at individual and collective levels.\nIt could be further claimed that existing research within the process view of\norganisational identity has been built around the triad of sense-making, identity and action\nprocesses (Fiol, 1991; Gioia & Chittipeddi, 1991; Pratt, 1998; Ravasi & Schultz, 2006). Gioia\net al. (2010) suggested that through performing this dynamic cycle organisations construct\ntheir identities by taking on new meanings about themselves and their stakeholders. Following\na similar logic, structural symbolic interactionists (Burke, 1991; Schultz et al., 2012; Stryker\n& Burke, 2000) pointed to the importance of external verification of identity, which Pratt\n(2012) referred to as the relational component of identity. This relational approach to\norganisational identity emphasises the importance of categories for constructing identities, as\nthey help depict differences between members and non-members of a collective and set\nboundaries for in-group versus out-group distinctiveness (Pratt, 2003). Therefore, building on\nthe importance of acting and inter-relating for identity construction (Langley & Tsoukas,\n2010), it could be further claimed that organisational identity cannot be thoroughly perceived\nand studied without observing dynamic processes of organisational interactions.\nThe third component of identity formation noted by proponents of the process view is\nsymbolic. Previous research emphasised the importance of narratives and stories as elements\nof the organisational identity construction process (Brown, 2006). It could be claimed that the\nnarrative approach provides another basis to link identity to process view, as previous studies\nhave identified narrative research as a key strategy for theorising from process data (Langley,\n1999). To sum up, brought together from different literatures, the relational, behavioural and\nsymbolic components of organisational identity appear convincing enough to open up identity\nresearch for process approaches and theorising (Pratt, 2012).\nIt could be further suggested that the process perspective acknowledges rather than\nreduces the complexity inherent in the world and the way organisations experience it. Thus,\nGioia and Patvardhan (2012) compared the process approach to organisational identity to a\nfull motion picture and claimed that the content approach only allows to capture one frame\n“as if” that, according to the authors, cannot be fully representational of the film. Hatch and\nSchultz (2002) emphasised that organisational identity is not an aggregation of perceptions\nabout the organisation held by internal and external stakeholders, but a dynamic collection of\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n65\n\nprocesses through which it is continuously negotiated and adjusted from interaction and,\ntherefore, is an ongoing accomplishment (Gioia & Patvardhan, 2012). Pratt (2012: 23) further\nsuggested that from the process view, organisational identity could be better captured through\nthe “processes of enacting “how we are becoming” rather than from defining “who we are” as\nan organisation”.\nGioia et al. (2000: 76) were the first to point to problems stepping from the prevailing\nassumption of identity endurance and endorse researchers to go beyond and explore “how\norganisational members work to maintain continuity”. Their call has gone largely\nunaddressed, and Anteby and Molnar (2012: 515) recently repeated it by stating that “how\nidentities actually endure over extended periods of time remains empirically poorly\nunderstood ... identity endurance is rarely seen as a puzzle to be explained; it is assumed as\nrelatively unproblematic and remains empirically neglected.” In the majority of studies that\naddressed the questions of endurance and change in organisations, researchers concentrated\ntheir efforts on planned organisational change like mergers or spinoffs. Moreover, these\nplanned changes in most cases have prompted contestations and revisions of organisational\nidentity. Thus, Clark et al. (2010) investigated organisational identity change as a result of a\nmerger between two healthcare organisations. Corley and Gioia (2004) studied organisational\nidentity in the context of a spin-off within a Fortune 100 company. Other scholars have also\ninvestigated organisational identity change in the context of creation of an online division of\na company (Brown & Gioia, 2002), changes in strategy (Nag, Corley, & Gioia, 2007) and\ncontinuity of sense-making when a planned organisational change is cancelled (Mantere et al.,\n2012). With regard to organisational identity revisions in situations of unplanned\norganisational changes, researchers have studied the cases of identity threats (Elsbach &\nKramer, 1996), changes in organisational leadership (Meyer et al., 2002), organisational\nresponses to environmental changes (Ravasi & Schultz, 2006) and external pressures (Dutton\n& Dukerich, 1991). Similar to most planned transformations, these unplanned developments\noften resulted in ambiguity or evident dissonance between current and desired organisational\nidentity, which were leading to identity work aimed at advancing organisational identity and\nclosing the gap between its actual and desired states. The above-mentioned studies made\nimportant contributions to implementing process thinking into organisational identity research\nby showing that it is subject to continuous renegotiation and change (Gioia et al., 2000).\nOrganisational identity centrality suggests that the notion should only contain the most\nvital features of the organisation, those to which organisational members ascribe the highest\nsignificance (Albert & Whetten, 1985). Such central values and beliefs provide a hub of shared\nunderstanding across disparate voices and help generate collective identity dynamic (Whetten\n\n66\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n& Godfrey, 1998) within an organisation. Nevertheless, insufficient studies have addressed\nthe problem of determining identity centrality in pluralistic identity organisations, where\nmembers driven by different logics would claim different elements as the most central and\nsufficient. Moreover, recent studies have tested previous assumptions of the organisational\nidentity centrality and discovered that in many instances such “common core” is likely to be\nmore fluid and fluctuating (Patvardhan et al., 2015).\nIn contrast to the enduring and central components of the organisational identity\ndefinition disputed by previous research, the importance of the “distinctive” element of Albert\nand Whetten’s (1985) original conceptualisation has been evident in the works of many\nidentity scholars. Gioia et al. (2010) claimed that distinctiveness should be associated with the\nemergence stage of organisational formation and development due to distinctiveness largely\nbeing viewed as a property used by organisations to establish boundaries between themselves\nand their external environment. Institutional theory argued that the natural tendency for\norganisations within any particular market industry is to get more homogeneous over time\n(DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). The process is supported by mechanisms of benchmarking and\nconsolidation that help strengthen similarities and vanish differences among market group\nparticipants. More recent advances in the organisational identity research suggested that\nentities within each market field strive to achieve “optimal distinctiveness” (Gioia et al., 2010;\nNavis & Glynn, 2010; Whetten, 2007), which is perceived as “a balance between similarity to\nother entities and uniqueness from them” (Kreiner et al., 2015). This acknowledgement of the\ndual nature of organisational identity as being simultaneously about similarity and difference\n(Whetten, 2006) helps incorporate process thinking into identity studies and gain insights on\nthe dynamic process of finding the balance of distinctiveness by organisations and larger\ncollectives.\nBesides introducing the concept of identity to organisational studies, Albert and\nWhetten (1985: 270) also suggested that “many, if not most, organisations are hybrids\ncomposed of multiple types.” They described hybrids as organisations, whose identity is\n“composed of two or more types that would not normally be expected to go together” (Ibid).\nAlbert and Whetten’s (1985) work motivated research that has encompassed various\nmanifestations of hybrid identities, challenges and tensions that arise for hybrid identity\norganisations and the impact of hybrid identities on organisational performance (Battilana &\nDorado, 2010; Battilana & Lee, 2014; Foreman & Whetten, 2002; Glynn, 2000; GoldenBiddle & Rao, 1997). Existing research has conceptualised organisational identity plurality in\ntwo terms: hybrid organisational identities and multiple organisational identities (Pratt, 2016).\nWhile the two concepts have been often used synonymously (Albert & Whetten, 1985;\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n67\n\nForeman & Whetten, 2002), recent studies pointed out subtle but important differences\nbetween the two (Corley et al., 2006).\nThe first research stream, hybrid organisational identities research, focused on\norganisations guided by two sets of institutional logics resulting in the identity duality (Albert\n& Whetten, 1985; Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Foreman & Whetten, 2002). Existing research\non hybrid organisational identities shares an assumption that the hybrid nature of an\norganisation creates internal tensions and contradictions. For example, Pratt (2016) pointed to\nthe presumed contradiction between utilitarian (monetary focused) and normative (noneconomic) dimensions as a key characteristic of hybrid identities. However, the recent rise of\nsustainable banks showed that hybrid organisations frequently survive and prosper despite this\ninbuilt tension (Albert & Adams, 2002).\nThe second research stream evolved around the concept of multiple organisational\nidentities (Albert & Whetten, 1985; Corley, 2004; Fiol, 1991; Pratt & Foreman, 2000; Pratt &\nKraatz, 2009; Sillince & Brown, 2009). In contrast to the hybrid identities literature, multiple\nidentities scholars suggested that “multiple organisational identities need not be antithetical”\n(Pratt & Foreman, 2000: 21). Furthermore, they also explored the possibility of an\norganisation having more than two identities. For instance, Pratt and Foreman (2000), in their\nfoundational work on multiple organisational identities, explicitly stated that organisations\ncould go beyond a dual identity. Finally, while research on hybrid organisational identities has\nlinked identities within an organisation to the organisational structure, no such structural\nrelationship has been confirmed by multiple organisational identities studies (Pratt, 2016).\nDespite their major differences around the number of possible identities (two versus two or\nmore) and their relationship (oppositional versus oppositional, complementary or just\ndifferent) (Pratt, 2016), both research streams have contributed valuable empirical and\ntheoretical insights on the identity plurality. The next section provides an overview of each\nresearch stream, drawing heavily on Albert and Whetten (1985) and Pratt and Foreman (2000)\nas these articles lay out some of the major tenets of each conceptualisation.\n\n3.3 Plurality of the Organisational Identity\nIn the past decades, business entities have been facing increasing expectations to\ngenerate not only economic but also social value (Battilana, 2018; Battilana & Dorado, 2010;\nEbrahim et al., 2014; Glynn, 2000). While organisational scholars have developed a vast body\nof knowledge on maximising profits, the question of how organisations can simultaneously\npursue financial and community development goals remains largely under-researched. Yet,\n\n68\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\nsome organisations have long been involved in pursuing a social mission, while\nsimultaneously engaging in commercial activities to finance their operations (Battilana & Lee,\n2014; Pache & Santos, 2013). In the existing literature, such organisations have been referred\nto as hybrid identity organisations (Albert & Whetten, 1985; Battilana & Dorado, 2010;\nForeman & Whetten, 2002; Glynn, 2000; Golden-Biddle & Rao, 1997) or multiple identities\norganisations (Corley, 2004; Pratt & Foreman, 2000; Pratt & Kraatz, 2009; Sillince & Brown,\n2009). Empirical examples of such organisations included micro-finance institutions\n(Battilana & Dorado, 2010), symphony orchestras (Glynn, 2000), law firms (Ozturk et al.,\n2017), food cooperatives (Ashforth & Reingen, 2014) and many others.\nSustainable banks have been widely reported to have pluralistic organisational\nidentities due to combining the community development and the banking logics at their core\n(Battilana & Lee, 2014; Dossa, 2013). Sustainable banks differ from the conventional financial\ninstitutions in treating their social missions as equally important to their financial resilience\ngoals. They also differ from the traditional development organisations because they earn\nincome from their banking products and services and do not rely on charitable donations or\ngovernment subsidies. In contrast to these well-established traditional types of organisations,\nsustainable banks do not add social or financial goals onto their primary activity but pursue\nsocial and financial missions simultaneously. As such, they are pluralistic identity\norganisations that combine different institutional logics (Friedland & Alford, 1991; Thornton,\nOcasio & Lounsbury, 2012), namely the banking and the community development (Battilana\n& Dorado, 2010), with their core activities blending economic and social principles (Besharov\n& Smith, 2014).\nA central insight in the contemporary organisational theory studying sustainable\norganisations is that the traditional way of organising within the banking sector has been a\nsubject to great change (Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Dossa, 2013). The rise of sustainable\nbanking movement and the development of an ecosystem supporting this new type of\norganisations have attracted the interest of researchers (Battilana, Besharov & Mitzinneck,\n2017), as well as government officials, funding institutions and the wider community. In the\naftermath of the global financial crisis, many of these stakeholders started seeing sustainable\nbanks as a promising vehicle for creating economic and social value, combating economic\ninequalities (Piketty, 2014) and addressing environmental degradations through the means of\nthe capitalist system. Others, however, have expressed doubts about the ability of sustainable\nbanks to preserve their dualistic missions and achieve high levels of both financial and\ncommunity development performance over time. Organisational research has long advocated\nfor the risk of these organisations drifting away from their social missions in the pursuit of\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n69\n\nmonetary gains (Ben-Ner, 2002; Christen & Drake, 2002; Jones, 2007; Mersland & Strøm,\n2010; Weisbrod, 2004).\nNonetheless, existing empirical examples have proven the ability of the sustainable\nbanking model to deliver both the community development and the financial benefits. For the\npast ten years, member banks of the GABV have been efficiently implementing the new\nunconventional model of financial services, which is beneficial to their customers as well as\nthe wider stakeholder community. While the topic of sustainable banking has been trending\nfor many years, still little insight has been provided on the underlying processes, which allow\nthese institutions to simultaneously pursue dual goals without causing a mission drift. This\nthesis addresses this gap through applying the pluralistic organisational identities framework\n(Pratt, 2016) to explore and explain the resilience of the sustainable banking identity.\n\n3.3.1 Hybrid organisational identities\nAlbert and Whetten (1985) introduced the concept of “hybrid organisations”, which they\ndescribed as those organisations that combine multiple forms that would not normally be\nexpected to occur together. Corley et al. (2006: 92) defined hybrid identities as “combinations\nof fully articulated identities that seem not to belong together.” Albert and Adams (2002: 35)\nexplained hybrid identities as “what is core, distinctive and at least relatively enduring about\nthe organisation is that it is both X and Y.” They further noted that these identities are\n“defended as inviolate, experienced as incompatible, and yet found to be indispensable.”\nExamples of hybrid organisations could be found across different sectors of economy and\ninclude law firms, health care organisations, food cooperatives, symphony orchestras, microfinance institutions, medical and sports organisations (Albert & Adams, 2002; Ashforth &\nReingen, 2014; Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Glynn, 2000; Golden-Biddle & Rao, 1997; Pratt &\nRafaeli, 1997).\nHybrid identities have been perceived by the organisational literature as unalterable to\nthe essence of organisation, yet being at odds (Albert & Adams, 2002). Albert and Whetten\n(1985) believed that organisations could develop identity duality over their life cycle due to\nthe complexity of external environment, identity divestiture or even organisational success.\nAlbert and Adams (2002: 35), however, argued that “not all hybrid organisations claim or\nhave a hybrid identity.” They claimed that hybrid identities could only be found in\norganisations, which hybrid character “represents its distinctive and relatively enduring core”\n(Ibid). This distinction is important as it sets organisations with hybrid identities apart from\nenterprises that possess multiple identities but do not have a hybrid form.\n\n70\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\nEssential to the conceptualisation of hybrid organisations has been the idea that\nidentities should be expected to be in some sort of conflict, therefore causing internal tensions\nwithin organisation (Albert & Whetten, 1985; Battilana & Lee, 2014; Pratt, 2016).\nNonetheless, the existing research has reported that despite the inbuilt internal contradictions\nbetween utilitarian and normative aspects within such organisations, many of them appear to\nbe sustainable, successfully achieve their goals and fulfil their organisational missions. For\nexample, Albert and Adams (2002) discovered that even extreme cases of hybrid identity\norganisations in which identities are defended as inviolate (nothing about each identity can be\ncompromised), are experienced as incompatible (internal conflict is inevitable) and are\nperceived as indispensable (no identity can be eliminated), could sustain themselves by finding\nquasi-stable forms of coherence. Ashforth and Reingen (2014) further suggested that looking\nfor ways to resolve identity duality could be a wrong focus for hybrid identity organisations,\nas they might benefit from keeping both identities over time since each of them is equally\nintrinsic to the organisational existence.\nAlbert and Whetten (1985) presented two forms in which hybrid organisational\nidentities can structurally co-exist within an organisation: an ideographic and holographic.\nIdeographic hybrid identities presume that each organisational unit or group has only one\nidentity, and opposing identities are embodied by different units or groups. On the contrary,\nin organisations with holographic hybrid identities, competing identities are housed within the\nsame units or groups. Building on Albert and Whetten’s (1985) concept of ideographic and\nholographic types, scholars studying hybrid identity organisations have provided empirical\nsupport for both types of organisations.\nPratt and Raffaeli (1997) in their early paper on hybrid organisational identities reported\non two polar identities found within a nursing rehabilitation unit: a rehabilitation and an acute\ncare identity. The two identities were embodied by different shifts of nurses, which led to the\ncreation of subgroups within the unit and resulted in the ideographic hybrid identity. Each\ngroup of nurses held contrasting beliefs about the organisational mission, their roles within\nthe unit and types of patients they should take care of. It is worth noting that in the Pratt and\nRaffaeli’s case ideographic identity divide did not occur along the lines of the organisational\nstructure since different shifts of nurses represented the same rehabilitation unit. Therefore,\nthis research provided evidence that not only structural units, but also groups of employees\nwithin an organisation can hold different ideographic forms (Pratt, 2016).\nAshforth and Reingen (2014) in their ethnographic study of a natural food cooperative\nnoted that the organisation embodied two subgroups, one of which represented “idealist”\nvalues, whereas the second one reflected “pragmatic” identity. Authors claimed that the value\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n71\n\nof each side of the duality was recognised at both the individual and the organisational levels\nas “a necessary evil” (Ibid: 507). As a result, members of the group representing one of the\nidentities nonetheless identified with the other group favouring the other identity because it\n“embodied a side of themselves they continued to value” (Ibid: 474). The authors concluded\nthat many of the dualities, which resulted from the hybrid identity of the natural food\ncooperative, were so critical to the organisational effectiveness that “if an out-group did not\nexist as an identity foil to one’s in-group, the in-group would have to create one” (Ibid: 507).\nIn Glynn’s (2000) study of the Atlantic Symphony Orchestra, the normative aspect of\nthe organisation’s identity – artistic excellence – was contained by musicians, while the\nutilitarian aspect – economic utility – was housed by professional administrators. Different to\nother studies, Glynn presented a case of the ideographic hybrid organisational identity in\nwhich normative artistry and utilitarian economics were embodied within different\norganisational units composed by different professional groups. Moreover, each of the\nidentities generated different expectations of the orchestra’s core competencies and resource\nclaims. Glynn showed how the inflexible structure of the orchestra further reinforced the\nideographic nature of the hybrid identity by isolating organisational members of different\nprofessions from each other.\nIn a similar manner, scholars have provided empirical evidence for the holographic form\nof hybrid organisational identities. For example, Golden-Biddle and Rao (1997) showed how\nidentity duality was shaping the behaviour of board directors in a non-profit organisation\nMedlay. According to the authors, because of the Medlay’s holographic hybrid identity, board\ndirectors were experiencing role conflicts. They had to conform with both the identity of\n“family of friends” and the identity of “advisors” to volunteering members of the organisation.\nGolden-Biddle and Rao (1997: 609) further suggested that the holographic form of the hybrid\nidentity generated the potential for conflicts of commitment for board directors, and therefore\nthe burden for organisational leadership to “recreate a sense of internal balance and\nidentification for individual board members, and restore the organisation's identity.”\nBattilana and Dorado (2010: 1419) studied another empirical example of the\nholographic form of organisational identity in their comparative research on two Bolivian\npioneering micro-finance organisations: BancoSol and Los Andes. The authors reported that\nin order to be sustainable, these new types of hybrid organisations needed to “create a common\norganisational identity that strikes a balance between the logics the organisation combines.”\nAuthors further claimed that such an identity would prevent formation of subgroup identities\nwithin hybrid organisations. Battilana and Dorado (2010) concluded that hiring and socialising\n\n72\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\npractices played a crucial role in developing common identity among the organisations’\nmembers.\nTherefore, previous research has provided substantial number of empirical examples of\nboth ideographic and holographic forms of hybrid identities from different industries and\nmarket segments. It should be mentioned, however, that not in every case organisational\nidentity could be clearly attributed to either ideographic or holographic hybrid form. Several\nstudies suggested that the divide does not always occur across structural units and can involve\ngroups and sub-groups within particular units or across the whole organisation (Ashforth &\nReingen, 2014; Glynn, 2000; Pratt & Rafaeli, 1997). Moreover, not in all cases the split\nbetween dual identities would be driven by the dichotomy between the normative and the\nutilitarian identities, as was initially predicted by Albert and Whetten (1985). In the examples\nfrom Asforth and Reingen (2014) and Pratt and Rafaeli (1997), both identities within the\nstudied organisations represented normative rather than utilitarian values. Therefore, Pratt\n(2016) suggested that existing empirical findings cannot be fully explained by Albert and\nWhetten’s (1985) conceptualisation of hybrid organisational identities and a more flexible\nmodel of identity plurality would be beneficial for future research.\n\n3.3.2 Multiple organisational identities\nA second model of organisational identity plurality was introduced by Pratt and\nForeman (2000), who advocated for the existence of multiple organisational identities. While\nAlbert and Whetten’s (1985) hybrid organisational identities framework does not explicitly\nexclude the possibility that organisations can possess more than two identities, their own work\nas well as the following research employing their model has only focused on the empirical\nexamples of identity duality (Albert & Whetten, 1985; Ashforth & Reingen, 2014; Glynn,\n2000; Golden-Biddle & Rao, 1997; Pratt & Rafaeli, 1997). Elaborating on Albert and\nWhetten’s (1985) definition of organisational identity, they suggested that organisations could\nhave multiple organisational identities when “different conceptualisations exist regarding\nwhat is central, distinctive, and enduring about the organisation” (Pratt & Foreman, 2000: 20).\nBuilding on the idea that organisations could have more than one identity, they argued that\nthose identities could exceed two and could be related in various ways including nonconflictual. Previous research has provided numerous empirical examples of organisations\nwith multiple identities (Corley, 2004; Pratt & Foreman, 2000; Pratt & Kraatz, 2009; Sillince\n& Brown, 2009).\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n73\n\nWhile the major differences between the hybrid and the multiple organisational\nidentities conceptualisations are in the identities number and relationships, it should be pointed\nout that research on multiple organisational identities also does not appear to view multiple\nidentities as having different structures. While it seems plausible that multiple organisational\nidentities could be ideographic or holographic, empirical examples have tended to be\nideographic in nature. Thus, Fiol (1991: 200) in her study noted that organisational members\nworking in various parts of an organisation may “exhibit different perceptions, make different\nattributions, and use different cognitive orientations.” She further claimed that multiple\norganisational identities may not always step from the organisational structure, and subunit\nidentities may arise due to “hierarchical differentiation, geographic dispersion, product\ndiversity, functional orientation, or any other factor that would tend to differentiate\nbehaviours” (Ibid).\nCorley (2004) in his study of the organisational identity change during a major\norganisational transformation in Milotronic found that multiple identities existed along the\nhierarchy levels within the organisation. The author reported that, while senior leadership\nperceived organisational identity as a driver of the organisational strategy and as an outgrowth\nof the organisation’s strategy, operational employees lower in the hierarchy believed\norganisational identity to be an outgrowth of their organisation’s culture. This identity\nmultiplicity resulted in contrasting expectations regarding identity stability and change, when\nemployees perceived organisational identity as rigid and unchanging, whereas the leadership\nbelieved it had to change “to keep up with changes the organisation faced in its competitive\nenvironments” (Corley, 2004: 1157).\nSillince and Brown (2009) in their study of forty-three English and Welsh\nconstabularies demonstrated that officially sanctioned web-based organisational identity\nclaims could be multiple and could be constituted using particular rhetorical strategies. The\nauthors suggested that, contrary to the widespread belief that organisations would seek to\nreconcile or redefine multiple identity claims, they might employ identity multiplicity as a\nmeans of satisfying sceptical audiences. Therefore, Sillince and Brown (2009: 1849) claimed\nthat, instead of being a source of internal tensions and mission drift, identity multiplicity “may\nsupport legitimacy claims for organisations subject to contradictory demands.”\nAnother important development within the multiple organisational identities\nframework has been the idea that identities do not necessarily have to be in conflict with each\nother. Pratt and Foreman (2000: 20) pointed out that “although scholars often are interested in\nsituations where the values and beliefs embedded in multiple identities are seemingly\nantithetical or place opposing demands on members, multiple identities need not be in\n\n74\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\ncompetition.” Corley et al. (2006) further developed this idea and suggested that organisations\ncould have more than two identities, and that those identities might be related in a variety of\nways, specifically oppositional, complementary or “relationally neutral” (simply different,\nneither clearly complementary nor oppositional).\nThese two main features of the multiple identities perspective – the number of\nidentities and the relationships among them – are the key dimensions for managing multiple\norganisational identities in Pratt and Foreman’s (2000) framework. The authors suggested that\nhaving multiple identities is “expensive” for organisations and therefore, leadership needs to\ndecide whether or not their organisation can afford multiple identities. Therefore, in their\nframework, identity plurality, which they conceptualised as simply the number of identities,\nis primarily driven by the availability of resources, which could include “human, financial,\nphysical, political, and otherwise” (Pratt, 2016: 110). Identity synergy, on the other hand,\nrefers to the degree of complementarity among multiple identities and determines whether\nmultiple organisational identities could be managed in an integrated fashion (Pratt & Foreman,\n2000). They further suggested that organisations could experience low or high degrees of\nidentity plurality and identity synergy, which will require different strategies to manage\nmultiple identities. Pratt and Foreman (2000) developed four ideal ways of managing multiple\nidentities: aggregation – creating a bridging device to keep complementary identities\nconnected without blending them together; compartmentalisation – separating neutral or\nconflicting identities physically, temporally or symbolically; integration – forming new\nidentity out of synergistic identities; and deletion – deleting competing or neutral identities.\n\n3.3.3 Bridging hybrid and multiple organisational identities perspectives\nDespite both perspectives being rooted in Albert and Whetten’s work (1985), there are\nsome important differences in the underlying assumptions and key dimensions of the two\nresearch streams on identity plurality (Corley et al., 2006; Pratt, 2016). As it was discussed\nabove, the main distinguishing factors between the two perspectives are the number of\norganisational identities and the relationships among them. Further, while the hybrid identity\nconcept linked identity plurality to the organisational structure and explored two opposite\nways in which identities could be structured (ideographic and holographic), no such structural\nrelationship has been noticed within the multiple organisational identities literature. I\nsummarise the main characteristics of the hybrid organisational identities and the multiple\norganisational identities concepts in Table 1. Nonetheless, Pratt (2016: 114) suggested that\njust like social constructivist and social actor views are increasingly being perceived as\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n75\n\ncomplementary (Gioia & Hamilton, 2016; Ravasi & Schultz, 2006) rather than mutually\nexclusive, it might be that “hybrid and multiple organisational conceptualisations may be\ncombined in some fashion.” He encouraged future research to explore whether organisations\ncould have “multiple, hybrid identities” or “multiple and hybrid identities” (Ibid: 115).\nTABLE 1.

As such, a central\nchallenge for the research on organisational identity plurality is understanding the factors that\nfacilitate the coherence of a pluralistic identity in the face of multiple conflicting goals brought\nby the economic and the ethical roles pursued by these organisations. Previous research has\nidentified a variety of mechanisms through which organisations could manage their pluralistic\nidentities. Smith and Besharov (2019) examined how a hybrid identity organisation from\nCambodia, Digital Data Divide, successfully sustained its pluralistic identity for over ten years\nsince its foundation. They uncovered that one of the factors that enabled the organisation to\ndo so was institutionalisation of an independent pursuit of its socially oriented and businessoriented missions. Digital Data Divide did that through setting separate sets of goals for social\nand commercial performance. Thus, the commercial mission was planned to be achieved\nthrough “increasing annual revenues by 40 percent a year to reach $1 million in revenues” and\n“more than doubling the number of employees from 175 to 450”, whereas the social mission\nwas pursuit through “develop[ing] 400 young leaders with technology skills to support\n\n76\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\neconomic and social development in the Mekong region” and “graduat[ing] 100 additional\ndata entry operators into jobs paying $100 + / month” (Smith & Besharov, 2019: 19).\nExploring the organisational identity duality, Ashforth and Reingen (2014) posed a\nquestion: “What makes both sides of the duality salient?” They demonstrated how a natural\nfood cooperative had institutionalised both idealist and pragmatist values through the means\nof the organisational mission, policies and bylaws. Authors discovered that the dual,\nseemingly incompatible goals were both infused in the core of the Natura’s identity. Thus, the\nbylaws stated that “Natura shall operate an economically democratic, sound, and efficient\ncooperative business” but also, “in doing so, the concerns of quality for people shall be deemed\nmore paramount than profit” (Ashforth & Reingen, 2014: 486). Such institutionalisation of\nthe dual value sets provided a solid foundation for balancing organisational duality and its\nassociated tensions, therefore facilitating the development and maintenance of a hybrid culture\nin the Natura cooperative (Ashforth & Reingen, 2014).\nAshforth and Reingen (2014: 485) further noted that despite the hybrid nature of the\nNatura cooperative’s identity, there nonetheless existed a mutual identity, a “shared belief that\nNatura’s identity was right, good, and better than alternatives”. Similarly, Dutton and\nDukerich (1991) in their early foundational work on the organisational identity plurality\ndiscovered that Port Authority’s identity had multiple characteristics, yet nonetheless\nconceptualised the organisation as having a single shared identity. A matching idea could be\nfound in the work of Battilana and Dorado (2010) on micro-finance organisations. On the\nexamples of BancoSol and Los Andes, the authors demonstrated that it is possible for hybrid\norganisations to develop a common organisational identity that “strikes a balance between the\nlogics they combine” (Battilana & Dorado, 2010: 1419). Hsu and Elsbach (2013) also\nsuggested that organisational identities could be comprised of multiple categories, but some\ncategories nonetheless would be consistently salient across groups, therefore ensuring a shared\nsense of unity. The latter may be viewed as one of the ways to conceptualise an organisation\nas having some identity plurality as well as some identity unity.\nPratt and Kraatz (2009), conceptualised the distinction between the identity and the\nself, and used it to explain how an organisation could have multiple identities and at the same\ntime, have a holistic understanding of “who we are” in the form of an organisational self. The\nauthors claimed that similar to individuals, who internalise expectations of their communities\n(as role identities) and develop a unique sense of who they are across these identities (a self),\norganisations could also internalise expectations of their stakeholders (in the form of\norganisational identities) and create a gestalt of these identities (an organisational self).\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n77\n\nTherefore, it could be concluded that the existing literature has provided sufficient\nbasis for conceptualising organisations as having more than one identity. To date such identity\nplurality has been approached in terms of hybrid or multiple organisational identities,\nhowever, empirical research in this area remains under-explored and underdeveloped\n(Battilana, 2018; Pratt, 2016). The notion of how organisations could have a shared\nunderstanding of “who we are” and simultaneously allow for diverse views on the topic is a\nfundamental question for future organisational identity research. Drawing upon an integrated\nprocess view of organisational identity, this study will further demonstrate how sustainable\nbanks, members of the GABV, develop such pluralistic identity through a set of identity work\ntactics, aimed at balancing the economic and the ethical goals and providing sustainable banks\nwith a coherent self.\n\n3.4 Implications of the Organisational Identity Plurality\nOver the last two decades, organisational identity theory has been one of the dominant\nstreams of research, which occupied a central position in academic attempts to describe\norganisations and their interactions with the environment (Albert & Whetten, 1985; Gioia,\n1998; Pratt & Foreman, 2000; Corley et al., 2006; Martin et al., 2011). Although the\nphenomenon of organisational identity has been widely researched, a broad range of questions\nremains unaddressed, offering opportunities for significantly extending and advancing identity\nstudies. Albert et al. (2000) in their call for better exploration of the concept and its theoretical\npotential suggested that identity is “problematic – and yet so critical ... that the dynamics of\nidentity need to be better understood”. Albert and Whetten (1985) pointed the attention of\nresearchers to the fact that “identity examination process can be conducted both internally and\nexternally” (in Balmer & Greyser, 2003: 83). Whetten and Mackey (2002) proclaimed that\nidentity studies can be undertaken on different forms of organising, but only if they can be\nmade, “identity enough” and “organisational enough” to promote meaningful scholarship.\nIn the complex contemporary economy, organisations increasingly encounter\ncompeting demands on their identities. Among other reasons, these tensions are caused by\nmultiple and oftentimes contradictory external forces. External stakeholders increasingly\nexpect for-profit organisations to contribute to community development goals at the same time\nas striving for financial resilience (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). Thus, arts organisations face\nincreasing economic demands to be financially self-reliant alongside the persisting artistic\ndemands for cultural authenticity (Glynn, 2000; Glynn & Lounsbury, 2005). Universities face\ngrowing expectations to implement commercially viable strategies, while ensuring high level\n\n78\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\nof research and teaching outcomes, which determine the identities of their faculty members\n(Kraatz, Ventresca, & Deng, 2010; Kraatz & Block, 2008). Likewise, hospitals experience\npressures to compete on an economic basis, while offering high quality care to their patients\nand supporting medical research, which doctors believe to be the core of their professional\nidentity (Dukerich, Golden, & Shortell, 2002; Reay & Hinings, 2009).\nThe existing literature has offered disparate perspectives on the intersection between\norganisational identity and institutional logics. Some researchers proposed that organisational\nidentity is socially constructed by organisational members (Corley & Gioia, 2004; Dutton &\nDukerich, 1991; Fiol, 1991; Ravasi & Schultz, 2006), while others advocated that\norganisational identity is determined by institutional logics (Battilana & D’Aunno, 2009;\nBattilana, Leca, & Boxenbaum, 2009; Powell & Colyvas, 2008; Seo & Creed, 2002). Still\nothers suggested that organisational identity acts as a filter that shapes organisational\nmembers’ interpretations of the institutional logics (Besharov & Brickson, 2016). A growing\nstream of research also examined the conditions under which sustainable organisations can\nmaintain the balance between the community development and the commercial institutional\nlogics over time (Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Canales, 2013; Pache & Santos, 2013). These\nstudies have identified organisational features and processes that help maintain versus disrupt\nthe simultaneous pursuit of dual goals.\nTherefore, organisations that combine multiple identities become subject to external\ndemands from numerous distinct institutional logics (Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Battilana &\nLee, 2014; Foreman & Whetten, 2002; Glynn, 2000; Golden-Biddle & Rao, 1997).\nInstitutional logics are central to organisational fields as they determine norms and values,\naffect resource acquisition and employees attraction and provide field level instruments of\npromoting shared interests through collective behaviour (Lee, 2014). Sustainable banks, as\norganisations that adopt aspects of both the commercial and the community development\nlogics, encounter an environment characterised by simultaneous demands for conformity to\nboth (Battilana & Dorado, 2010). Sustainable banks thus face a unique challenge of balancing\ntheir social and commercial activities in order to remain financially profitable without losing\nsight of their social and environmental mission (Dossa, 2013). These financial institutions\ncombine potentially conflicting goals (financial and community development), as well as\npotentially inconsistent stakeholder interests.\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n79\n\n3.4.1 Organisational Identity and Institutional Logics\nPrevious research has described institutional forces as taken-for-granted social\nprescriptions, “cognitive, normative, or regulative pressures” that organisations confront in\ntheir external environments (Scott, 2008). These broad belief systems shape the structures,\npractices and identities of organisations and their members (Friedland & Alford, 1991; Ocasio,\n1997; Thornton, 2004). Scott (1994; 2008) further defined institutional forces as “external\ncultural frameworks” that reflect shared understandings of what constitutes legitimate goals\nand means of achieving them (Scott, 1994). In order to explain the distinct sets of institutional\nforces that organisations encounter, organisational scholars often referred to the concept of\n“institutional logics,” defined as “socially constructed, historical patterns of material practices,\nassumptions, values, beliefs and rules” (Thornton & Ocasio, 1999: 804). Institutional logics\nrepresent societal-level cultural meaning systems and provide coherent and legitimate\norganising principles for organisational fields (Friedland & Alford, 1991; Thornton, 2004;\nThornton, Ocasio, & Lounsbury, 2012).\nPrevious research also has pointed out that multiple institutional logics often coexist\nin organisational fields (Marquis & Lounsbury, 2007; Reay & Hinings, 2009), where they may\nimpose potentially contradictory demands on organisations (Goodrick & Salancik, 1996;\nOliver, 1991). Several authors further suggested that the multiplicity of institutional logics\nposes challenges for organisations as it has been previously reported to cause intra\norganisational tensions among organisational members and functions that enact those\ninstitutional logics (Glynn, 2000). Nonetheless, existing studies provided little evidence on\nhow organisations respond to the demands imposed by multiple institutional logics (Kraatz &\nBlock, 2008; Pache & Santos, 2010).\nSustainable finance field has been reported to be governed by the commercial and the\ncommunity development institutional logics, which represent different sets of norms, goals\nand expectations imposed on sustainable banks (Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Dossa, 2013).\nThus, the community development logic guides organisational mission towards responsible\nsocial and environmental performance, practices of social inclusion and support to\nunderbanked groups within the communities, whereas the commercial logic requires economic\nprosperity sufficient to support ongoing operations and fulfil fiduciary obligations (Battilana\n& Dorado, 2010). Transgressing the boundaries between enhancing the quality of life within\nthe communities of operation and offering financial products and services is widely seen as a\npotential source of mission drift towards fulfilling financial goals at the expense of\nenvironmental and social priorities (Drake & Otero, 1992). Sustainable banking organisations,\n\n80\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\ntherefore, face a unique challenge of handling this trade-off between the commercial and the\ncommunity development logics, which they combine. They need to develop a delicate balance\nbetween commercial and community development activities to simultaneously remain\neconomically viable and keep focus on their social and environmental purposes.\nTABLE 2.

The notion of “deserving” derives from the argument that funds are limited and should be\ndirected either to those in the most need or to those with the highest multiplication effect.\nSource: Author (2019)\n\nSustainable banks are accountable for both developing the communities in which they\noperate and for making financial gains for their members. Guided by these two institutional\nlogics, they strive to excel at both social and financial performance. It should be mentioned\nthat traditional commercial and charitable organisations also face increasing pressures to\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n81\n\nmonitor their performance along both domains. Nonetheless, sustainable banks that combine\nthe community development and the commercial logics in their core face a unique challenge\nbecause both dimensions are equally important for accomplishing their organisational\nmissions. These dual goals may be misaligned and/or contradictory, therefore posing threat to\nthe missions of sustainable banks. Moreover, while the financial performance could be\neffectively monitored and assessed through the existing instruments, evaluation and\nmeasurement of the organisational community development performance currently lacks\nstandardisation and comparability (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Ebrahim & Rangan, 2010).\nSustainable banks are also accountable to multiple groups of principle stakeholders\n(Freeman, 1984). They face the challenge of simultaneously addressing the needs and\ndemands of multiple beneficiaries targeted by their community development and commercial\nmissions. The conventional financial institutions operate in a traditional principal-agent\nmodel, where the principals (owners of the resources) are represented by governing boards\nthat ensure the effective management of an organisation in favour of the principals\n(Eisenhardt, 1989a; Przeworski, Stokes, & Manin, 1999). Sustainable banks, on the contrary,\nare accountable to multiple principal stakeholders (Freeman, 1984; Mitchell, Agle, & Wood,\n1997) with competing objectives, some of which have more resources than others to enforce\ntheir interests. In order to hold management accountable and avoid a mission drift, sustainable\nbanks require means to align and prioritise these diverse and potentially contradictory\ninterests.\nThe existing literature has offered three distinct perspectives on the interface between\norganisational identity and institutional logics (Besharov & Brickson, 2016). Much of the\norganisational identity studies claimed the phenomenon to be internally determined and\nsocially constructed by organisational members, who may draw on institutional logics in the\nprocess, but nonetheless preserve considerable agency over it (Gioia, Price, Hamilton, &\nThomas, 2010; Ravasi & Schultz, 2006). The institutional literature, on the contrary,\nadvocated for the externally determined nature of organisational identity and described the\nphenomenon as constructed out of and constrained by institutional logics representing broader\ncultural value systems that provide organising principles for organisational fields (Thornton,\nOcasio, & Lounsbury, 2012). Finally, several studies within the both literatures offered an\nalternative perspective that portraits organisational identity as a filter that determines the ways\norganisational members encounter institutional logics (Elsbach & Kramer, 1996; Gioia &\nThomas, 1996; Greenwood, Raynard, Kodeih, Micelotta, & Lounsbury, 2011). While\nemphasising different aspects of the interrelation, each of the three perspectives offered\nvaluable insight into the intersection between organisational identity and institutional logics.\n\n82\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\nNonetheless, there have been few attempts to bridge these perspectives within the\norganisational identity or institutional logics literatures (for an exception, see Glynn, 2008 and\nBesharov & Brickson, 2016).\n3.4.1.1 Organisational Identity as Agentically Constructed\nThe first perspective has been developed within the organisational identity literature.\nThis stream of research advocated for the organisational members’ agentic role in constructing\nand maintaining organisational identity through the processes of sense-making and sensegiving (Corley & Gioia, 2004; Dutton & Dukerich, 1991; Fiol, 1991; Ravasi & Schultz, 2006).\nSense-making refers to the organisational members’ efforts to “structure the unknown”\n(Waterman, 1990: 41) and interpret reality (Weick, 1995), whereas sense-giving stands for\nefforts, often undertaken by organisational leadership, to shape members’ organisational\nidentity interpretations (Gioia & Chittipeddi, 1991). Organisational members perform these\nprocesses through the construction of narrative (Anteby & Molnar, 2012; Sonenshein, 2010)\nand identity enactment (Ashforth & Reingen, 2014; Besharov & Smith, 2014; Brickson &\nAckinlade, 2015). Narratives as shared stories enable organisational members to create a\ncommonly shared organisational identity (Wertsch, 2012). Narratives may also be employed\nto change organisational identity by reworking old narratives that do not fit the desired identity\n(Humphreys & Brown, 2002), replacing old narratives with new interpretations (Sonenshein,\n2010) or reinterpreting stories from the organisation’s past (Schultz & Hernes, 2013).\nOrganisational identity further is enacted through organisational policies and practices, which\nenable both internal and external stakeholders to make sense of the organisation (Ravasi &\nSchultz, 2006).\nEven though the majority of the organisational identity literature emphasised the\nagency of members in socially constructing organisational identity, several studies have\npointed to the role of institutional logics in the process of organisational identity formation\nand maintenance (Gioia, Price, Hamilton & Thomas, 2010; Navis & Glynn, 2010). According\nto these studies, the external environment confronts organisations with a set of institutionalised\nexpectations about legitimate types or categories of organisations that can claim membership\nin particular fields. Albert and Whetten’s (1985) in their foundational work expressed an idea\nthat organisational claims about membership in organisational fields constitute significant part\nof their organisational identities. Whetten and Mackey (2002:397) further suggested that\n“organisational identity is appropriately conceived of as a set of categorical identity claims\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n83\n\n(who or what we claim to be, categorically) in reference to a specified set of institutionally\nstandardised social categories.”\nWhen commenting on the link between organisational identity and institutional\nenvironment, the organisational identity studies often have portrayed institutional logics as\none of the elements, which organisational members can draw on in the process of constructing\nand maintaining collective understandings of their organisation (Gioia, Price, Hamilton &\nThomas, 2010). In their study of satellite radio, Navis and Glynn (2010) outlined how\nmembers of both Sirius and XM organisations heavily relied on their membership in the novel\nemerging “satellite radio” market field in collectively constructing their organisational\nidentities. Later, each organisation tailored their distinctive identity within the category\nthrough business partnerships and celebrity endorsements, however, emphasising the salient\nfeatures of the market field to retain their membership in the category and legitimacy among\nstakeholders. Therefore, drawing on institutional logics as building blocks or “identity codes”\n(Navis & Glynn, 2010: 442), organisational members constructed organisational identity\nthrough a sort of “institutional bricolage” (Glynn, 2008). Organisations balanced their\nsameness of market field membership against their individuation as distinctive category\nmembers by incorporating institutional logics into their identities in unique ways, allowing\norganisations to retain both their distinctiveness and legitimacy of categorical membership.\nNavis and Glynn’s (2010) study displayed the process of organisational identity\nconstruction in which organisational members have a shared understanding about the\ninstitutional logics that should guide the process. However, in other cases organisations\nencounter pluralistic and potentially inconsistent institutional logics. Moreover, in some cases\norganisational members may lack an agreement on which logics should be drawn upon in\ndefining the organisational core, which is likely to cause internal debates about multiple\npossible “institutional building blocks” (Besharov & Brickson, 2016). In their research on two\npioneering commercial micro-finance organisations, Battilana and Dorado (2010) explained\nthat BancoSol and Los Andes both emerged as spin-offs from NGOs. Historically they had a\nstrong community development focus, and their micro-finance work was initially regarded as\na purely non-profit endeavour, whose financing was heavily reliant on donations. However,\nwith the spin-off of micro-finance operations into registered financial organisations, BancoSol\nand Los Andes faced the expectation to turn “lend to the poor” into a self-sustaining operation\nby charging interest rates sufficiently high to cover the costs of lending, and in insisting on\nloan repayments, which was previously largely not required. Therefore, the community\ndevelopment logic pressed organisational members to retain their mission of providing access\n\n84\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\nto financial services to underbanked groups of the population, whereas the commercial logic\nsimultaneously pressed them to fulfil fiduciary obligations of commercial financial\ninstitutions. To respond to these two institutional logics, micro-finance organisations had to\nbridge the community development and the commercial logics, and involve themselves in\nhiring and socialising processes that would guide their members on how the two sets of\nidentity claims could co-exist within the organisations without causing a mission drift.\n3.4.1.2 Organisational Identity as Institutionally Determined\nWhile much of the organisational identity literature emphasised the agency of\norganisational members in constructing shared understandings of the organisational core,\ninstitutional theory has pointed to the importance of institutionalised logics in mitigating the\nprocess of creating, maintaining and changing organisational identities (Battilana & D’Aunno,\n2009; Battilana & Lee, 2014; Powell & Colyvas, 2008; Seo & Creed, 2002). Early institutional\nstudies described dominant field logics as the main and often exclusive underling power\ndriving organisational identity construction. Glynn and Marquis (2004) studied how\norganisational names, as identity labels, changed over time in response to prevailing logics\nwithin the institutional environments. They uncovered that institutional logics about naming\nstandards in different historical periods functioned as legitimating forces for organisational\nidentities, eliciting conformity to the constitutive field rules. Thornton (2004), in her research\non higher education publishing, further showed that changes in organisational identity and\nstructure of publishing houses were affected by two dominant institutional logics within the\nfield, namely “publishing as craft” and “publishing as business”. She advanced academic\nunderstanding of the relationship between institutional logics and organisational identity by\nproviding evidence for the moderating effect, which field level logics have on internal\norganisational processes.\nEven though the majority of the institutional theory literature has described\norganisational identity construction and maintenance processes as dominated by\ninstitutionalised field logics, some institutional scholars have admitted and explored the role\nof organisational members in constructing organisational identity through active interpretation\nand incorporation of institutional drivers (Besharov & Brickson, 2016; Pratt & Kraatz, 2009;\nPhillips, Tracey, & Kraatz, 2016). This idea dates back to the early works of Selznick (1949),\nwho studied how organisational members actively utilised institutional building blocks to\nconstruct distinctive organisational identities. He suggested that organisational leaders played\na key role in this process and proactively engaged in identity work to develop an organisational\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n85\n\nidentity that would reflect the needs and expectations of diverse internal and external\naudiences.\nRecent studies further elaborated on these ideas and provided more evidence on the\ninterplay of organisational identity and institutional logics. Pratt and Foreman (2000)\nadvocated for four strategies that may be employed by organisations to navigate pluralistic\ninstitutional logics, including aggregating them into a bridging meta-identity, integrating them\ninto one coherent identity, compartmentalising identities associated with distinct institutional\nconstituencies or deleting problematic identities. Pratt and Raffaeli (1997) illustrated the\ncompartmentalisation approach in their study of a nursing rehabilitation unit. Faced with\ncompeting expectations from a rehabilitation and an acute care logics, nurses built subgroups,\nwhich were operating different shifts and held opposing views about organisational mission,\ntypes of patients and their own roles within the unit. Likewise, Christiansen and Lounsbury\n(2013:199) studied how members of a beer brewer Carlsberg acted as “bricoleurs” to\ncreatively combine elements of the social responsibility and the market logics in the process\nof organisational identity renegotiation.\nTherefore, the organisational identity and the institutional logics literatures have\ndeveloped different perspectives on the agency of organisational members and significance of\ninstitutional forces in constructing and maintaining organisational identity. Nonetheless, both\nstreams of research have provided considerable evidence that organisational members engage\nwith elements of institutional logics in their identity work. Besharov and Brickson (2016: 401)\nfurther claimed that rather than being treated as completely independent, these two\nperspectives might be viewed as “characterising different points along a continuum\nrepresenting organisational identity construction, anchored by high member agency at one end\nand by high institutional constraint at the other”.\n3.4.1.3 Organisational Identity as Filter\nThe first two approaches represent opposing ends on the continuum from\norganisational members’ agency in constructing organisational identity to institutional logics’\ndominance over this process. Nonetheless, within the both literatures a third perspective could\nbe noticed that portrays organisational identity as a filter, which determines how\norganisational members perceive, depict and react to institutional logics (Besharov &\nBrickson, 2016). Previous research has provided evidence on role of organisational identity in\nconstructing organisational responses to institutional change (Fox-Wolfgramm, Boal, & Hunt,\n1998), building relations with stakeholders (Brickson, 2005; Scott & Lane, 2000) and\n\n86\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\nembracing institutional standards (Sahlin & Wedlin, 2008). Besharov and Brickson (2016:\n402) further claimed that most studies in both the organisational identity and the institutional\nlogics literatures have focused on “the extent to which the content of organisational identity\naligns with the content of the demands arising from the external environment” as the main\nfactor, which influences the role of organisational identity as a filter. Research in both\nliteratures has suggested that greater correspondence between the organisational identity\nfeatures and the institutional demands increases members’ alertness and receptiveness of those\ninstitutionally imposed liabilities.\nIn the organisational identity literature, Dutton and Dukerich (1991) in their study of\nthe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, uncovered that interpretations, which the\ntransportation agency’s employees possessed about their organisation’s identity, affected their\nactions in response to the external demand to deal with the many homeless people at the Port\nAuthority facilities. The authors concluded that organisational identity was central to\nunderstanding “how issues are interpreted, how reactions are generated, how and what types\nof emotions are evoked, and how these behaviours are related to one another in an\norganisational context” (1991:551). While organisational members were viewing the\norganisational identity as driven by technical competence, the solutions they offered were\nlargely reactive and based on attempts to eliminate the problem. However, when the Port\nAuthority members were pressured to adopt public service as a central element of their job,\ntheir responsiveness to the problem had increased leading to the organisation proposing and\nfunding the construction of outreach centres for the homeless near the affected facilities.\nSimilarly, Elsbach and Kramer (1996: 442) in their study of the U.S. business schools rankings\nclaimed that members of the \"top-20\" business schools responded differently to the Business\nWeek survey rankings depending on how much the results were “calling into question their\nperceptions of highly valued, core identity attributes of their schools” or “challenging their\nbeliefs about their schools' standing relative to other schools.”\nWithin the institutional literature, organisational identity also was acknowledged to\nhave considerable influence over the organisational responses to institutional demands\n(Greenwood, Raynard, Kodeih, Micelotta, & Lounsbury, 2011). Moreover, institutional\nscholars, similar to their colleagues from the organisational identity research, noted that a\ngreater correspondence between organisational identity and institutional logics leads to a\nhigher alertness and receptivity to the demands of those logics from organisational members.\nRaffaelli and Glynn (2013) in their study of the Fortune 500 organisations discovered that\ncompanies claiming a CSR identity (via GRI reporting) were more willing to adopt the\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n87\n\ncustomised employee volunteering program (EVP) recommended by industry professional\nnetworks than organisations without such identity claims. Authors concluded that\n“organisational identity was a significant filter for tailored practices” (2013:557). Similarly,\nKodeih and Greenwood (2013) in their research on four French business schools claimed that\nschools’ readiness to take a turn towards a more North American model of management\neducation was driven by organisations’ current and aspired future identities. Schools with\nhigher international ambition were more willing to adopt new practices and approaches\nbecause they saw it as an opportunity to become more international and raise their\norganisations’ status.\nWhile most studies focusing on the role of organisational identity as a filter pointed\nout to the correspondence between organisational identity content and institutional logics,\nseveral studies also have suggested other features of organisational identity to have an effect\non the ways organisational members perceive and embrace institutional demands (Besharov\n& Brickson, 2016). Kraatz and Block (2008) and Pratt and Kraatz (2009) noted that\norganisations with a coherent integrated identity are more effective in depicting and aligning\nmultiple and inconsistent institutional demands than organisations with pluralistic identities.\nBuilding on the previous research claiming organisational identity plurality to be a source of\ntension, the authors suggested that organisational identity plurality creates multiplicity of\nviews on what are the central, enduring and distinct features of organisation leading to\ndivergent interpretations and prioritisations of institutional demands.\nMilliken (1990) introduced a concept of organisational identity “strength” and\nresearched how this feature affects the ways universities depict and respond to demographic\nchanges in the institutional environment. Gioia and Thomas’s (1996) further developed these\nideas in their study of strategic decision-making in universities and claimed that stronger\norganisational identity contributed to universities being more likely to perceive institutional\ndemands as strategic opportunities and, therefore, more willing to adapt changes enforced by\nthem. They further suggested that organisational responsiveness towards institutional\ndemands varied based on utilitarian (economically driven) or normative (non-economic)\nnature of organisational identity, with utilitarian identities determining a higher likelihood of\norganisations portraying institutional changes as opportunities for growth and development.\nTherefore, the organisational identity and the institutional logics theories have noted\nvarious aspects of organisational identity to affect the ways organisational members perceive\nand respond to institutional demands. Sufficient empirical evidence has been provided to\nemphasise the importance of correspondence between the organisational identity features and\n\n88\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\nthe institutional logics in enhancing organisational members’ consciousness and receptivity\ntowards institutional demands.\n\n3.5 Organisational Identity Plurality and Stakeholder Relations\nIndividual level theories have long focused on the individuated concept of “self”,\nexploring how individuals view themselves as distinct from others. Cross-cultural research\napproach (Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 1989) moved existing theories to recognise\nthat individuals may view themselves both as independent entities separated from others and\nas interdependent entities closely tied to others (Brickson, 2007). As a result, the initial\nunilateral approach has been substituted with a regard of self-view as either “individualistic”\nor “collectivistic”. Brewer and Gardner (1996) further challenged the assumption of two selfviews as still being overly simplistic and suggested that interdependent identities can be\nqualitatively different in nature. They advocated for adding the third self-view of a relationship\npartner, which fundamentally differs than the self-view of a member of collective. Authors\nclaimed that the self-view as a relationship partner is based on a personalised dyadic\nrelationship with particular others and on occupying significant roles to them, in contrast with\nthe self-view as a member of collective, which implies a more impersonal relation to a larger\nwhole (Brickson, 2005). On the back of the Brewer and Gardner’s (1996) findings, three\ndistinct self-view forms have become widely acknowledged. First, the self-view guided by\nindividualistic traits and characteristics that distinguish a person from others. Second, the selfview of being dyadically connected to particular others through personalised bonds of\nattachment. Finally, the self-view as a member of a larger collective, which does not imply\npersonalised ties to the group or the cause. This three part typology of self-views has been\nempirically supported by several studies (Gabriel & Gardner, 1999; Kashima & Hardie, 2000)\nand theoretically extended by fleshing out the antecedents and consequences of a self-view\ninto an “identity orientation framework” (Brickson, 2000). It has been further pointed out that\nvarious identity orientations have important implications for the motivation state. An\nindividualistic orientation is associated with concerns for personal benefit, a relational\norientation is associated with regards for the welfare of selected relationship partners and a\ncollectivistic orientation is associated with an emphasis on well-being of a greater community.\nPrevious research at the organisational level also has been long dominated by a\ndichotomy between organisations as individual entities and organisations as social entities\n(Brickson, 2007). Empirical studies within corporate social responsibility (Agle, Mitchell, &\nSonnenfeld, 1999), human resource management (Gooderham, Nordhaug, & Ringdal, 1999)\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n89\n\nand psychological contracts (Rousseau & McLean Parks, 1993) discussed the differences\nbetween individualistic and more socially oriented organisational approaches. Brickson (2000;\n2005) further suggested that the identity orientation framework could be applied to the\norganisational level of analysis. They noticed that similar to individuals, organisations are\ndefined by their members as individualistic entities, relationship partners or members of a\nlarger group.\nRecent empirical research suggested that the interdependent or “socially oriented”\nperspective could be further divided into relational and collectivistic identity orientations\n(Brickson, 2005). The work of Trevino, Butterfield and McCabe (1998) on the ethical work\nclimate presented some empirical evidence of the three identity orientations being present at\nthe organisational level. The authors used four factors to predict the attitudes and behaviours\nof employees, three of which correspond with the identity orientations: “self-interest climate”\n(when organisations expect their members to promote their own prosperity); “employeefocused climate” (where organisations expect their members to care for each other); and\n“community-focused climate” (in which organisations expect their members to advance the\nwell-being of a larger community). The fourth factor employed by Trevino et al. (1998), “law\nand professional code climate” corresponded to adherence to professional and legal standards.\nThese studies from various literatures suggested that organisational identity\norientation would have significant implications for the ways organisations relate to their\nstakeholders within and outside the organisation. Stakeholder relations of individualistic\nidentity organisations are guided by instrumentality or indifference, which would result in\nfewer and weaker relationship ties (Brickson, 2000). Relational identity organisations\nestablish connections to selected partners based on cooperation and trust, which creates strong\ndyadic ties between them (Brass et al., 1998). Concurrently, collectivistic identity\norganisations take a networking approach to their stakeholder relations by prioritising their\nconnections based on cooperation within larger groups (Brickson, 2000).\nThe nature of identity orientation at the organisational level mirrors the one at the\nindividual level. Concerning an individualistic identity orientation, members view\norganisation as an independent entity characterised by organisational features, which\ndistinguish it from other institutions. Individualistic organisations prioritise maximising the\norganisation’s own prosperity. Within an organisation with a relational identity orientation,\nmembers focus on the organisation’s traits that dyadically connect it to selected partners that\nare perceived as having high value for the organisation’s welfare. The emphasis, therefore, is\non maintaining these relationships and promoting the well-being of selected others. Finally,\n\n90\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\norganisations with collectivistic identity orientation emphasise maximising the prosperity of\na wider community. Members of a collectivistic organisation consider it to be part of a larger\ngroup and value those organisational features that connect it to the larger whole.\n\n3.5.1 Organisational Identity Orientation Framework\nOrganisational identity has been widely described as an organisational level construct,\nwhich reflects members’ shared perceptions about the organisation and responds to the “who\nare we as an organisation?” question (Albert & Whetten, 1985). Organisational identity is\ncomprised of the features that organisational members recognise as central, distinctive to the\norganisation and persistent within the organisation over time (Albert & Whetten, 1985; Dutton\n& Dukerich, 1991; Pratt & Foreman, 2000). Identity guides organisational actions allowing\nentities to establish coherent relations with counterparts and helping the counterparts\nunderstand how to interact with the organisations (Albert & Whetten, 1985; Swann, 1987).\nBuilding on this theorisation, the concept of organisational identity orientation\n(Brickson, 2005; 2007) was introduced to express “the assumed nature of association between\nan organisation and stakeholders as perceived by members” (2007: 866). Organisational\nidentity orientation does not refer to the nature of association between individuals inside an\norganisation and individuals-outsiders, but to the nature of association between an\norganisation as a whole and other entities. Similar to organisational identity, organisational\nidentity orientation is culturally embedded (Hatch & Schultz, 1997) and negotiated among\nmembers (Scott & Lane, 2000). Organisational identity orientation describes the link between\norganisational self-perception and its standing towards stakeholder groups. It reflects\norganisational mission statements, codes of conduct, strategies, policies, rules and procedures,\nas well as shared interests, goals, concerns and agendas (Wickert & Schaefer, 2015). The\nconcept is aimed at capturing the roles that organisations adopt in interactions with their\nstakeholders and at explaining the motivations that drive organisations towards choosing and\nenacting particular roles.\nOne of the great advantages of this framework is its ability to move away from\nquestioning whether organisations should be actively involved in the communities in which\nthey operate to portraying all organisations as active social actors that interact with their\nstakeholders in various forms. The concept was initially developed at the individual level\nstudies of identity (Brewer & Gardner, 1996) and applied to the organisational level in a twoindustry study by Brickson (2005). Foundational paper by Brickson (2005) outlined three\ntypes of organisational identity orientations with distinct cognitive and motivational\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n91\n\ncharacteristics: individualistic, relational and collectivistic. Previous studies revealed a\ncorrelation among a number of organisational features, such as industry, nature of\nbeneficiaries and organisational structure and identity orientation of an entity. At the same\ntime, they documented that identity orientation could still vary considerably, suggesting that\norganisations are less bounded by their structural features than could have been expected and\npossess considerable discretion over their orientation towards stakeholders.\n3.5.1.1 Individualistic Organisational Identity Orientation\nIndividualistic identity orientation reflects an organisation’s self-perception as an\natomised individualistic actor majorly disconnected from other entities. From an\nindividualistic perspective, stakeholder groups are salient to the extent that they could assist\nor constrain an organisation in achieving its goals. Individualistic standing would generally be\nassociated with an instrumental approach to stakeholder management aimed at enhancing the\norganisational performance towards its goals, such as brand leadership, financial returns or\nmarket share. At the same time, individualistic identity orientation is believed to promote\nincreased individual initiative, ambition, efficiency, adaptability and innovation within\n\norganisations (Brickson, 2007). Entities with an individualistic identity orientation generally\nhave weaker ties with stakeholders other than shareholders due to their belief in the idea of\nindependence between entities (Brass et al., 1998).\nWith regard to sustainable banks, the existing literature considered these organisations\nunlikely to be dominated by individualistic identity orientation, as their profit-making goals\n\nare balanced with the simultaneous pursuit to solve social problems by benefitting their direct\npartners (relational) or larger causes (collectivistic) (Thompson & Doherty, 2006). Even\nthough in some cases sustainable finance organisations may involve in profit-generating\nactivities that reflect individualistic orientation, such operations will still enhance the\nachievement of their community development missions (Pache & Santos, 2013; Young, 2001).\n3.5.1.2 Relational Organisational Identity Orientation\nRelational identity orientation is used to describe an organisation’s self-definition as an\nactor oriented towards a selected number of relationships with particular stakeholders that are\n\nsubjectively assigned high significance in organisational activities. Relational identity\norientation organisations tend to prioritise relationships with constituencies that are the most\nsalient to their organisational identity and support causes that are the most closely related to\ntheir stakeholders’ interests (Bingham et al., 2011). As opposed to individualistic identity\n\n92\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\norganisations that involve in stakeholder relations to advance their financially motivated goals,\nrelational identity organisations perceive relationships with external constituencies as ends in\nthemselves. According to the relational identity orientation logic, this focus on associations\nwith the valued constituents strengthens the congruency that organisations are likely to see\nbetween themselves and their stakeholders (Brickson, 2007; Gomez-Mejia et al., 2007). This\noperational logic enables relational identity orientation organisations to cultivate identity traits\nthat are both unique to them and congruent with the claims of their stakeholders (Albert &\n\nWhetten, 1985; Scott & Lane, 2000).\nPrevious literature suggested that sustainable banks as organisations with high corporate\nresponsibility credentials may possess relational identity orientation (Brickson, 2005; 2007;\nFreeman et al., 2004; Thompson & Doherty, 2006). Guided by their community development\nlogic, sustainable banks aim to support self-selected, underprivileged or disadvantaged\n\ncustomers (Austin & Ebrahim, 2010). Therefore, the establishment of strong and lasting ties\nwith these stakeholders becomes a central objective of sustainable finance institutions, which\nmay not always collide with increased profitability or enhancement of a broader community\nwellbeing.\n\n3.5.1.3 Collectivistic Organisational Identity Orientation\nCollectivistic identity orientation refers to an organisational self-concept of a member\nof a broader community connected to all members of a social group. This type of identity\norientation is more system centred, emphasising relationships based on service alliances,\n\nstrong coalition-based ties and cooperative approaches (Brickson, 2007). Collectivistic\nidentity organisations are focused on fostering broad social welfare without targeting any\nparticular community, for example by “promoting the ecological sustainability of the earth”\n(Brickson, 2005: 577). Organisations with a collectivistic identity orientation further view\nstakeholders as collaborators, who experience the effects of their corporate behaviours\n(Freeman, 1984). Contributing to the welfare of its members reinforces the identity of\ncollectivistic organisations as those that make stakeholder contributions that are consistent\nwith their values (Albert & Whetten, 1985). Collectivistic identity orientation organisations\nestablish their stakeholder relationships driven by common purpose, but similar to\n\nindividualistic identity orientation organisations they do not view these relationships as a\nmeans to an end (Wickert, 2015). Nonetheless, the shared agenda is focused on wellbeing of\na larger community and, therefore, is driven by motivations that are very different from selfinterested goals of individualistic identity orientation organisations (Brickson, 2007).\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n93\n\nThe existing studies claimed that collectivistic identity orientation could be adopted by\nmany socially oriented organisations (Thompson & Doherty, 2006; Wickert, 2015). Findings\nfrom my research, however, contradict this prevailing assumption and propose that sustainable\nbanks maintain relational identity orientation towards their stakeholders. They develop strong\nties with particular customers, usually underserved and previously excluded from the agendas\nof conventional financial institutions and avoid supporting a broad but unspecified community\ndevelopment agenda.\n\n3.5.2 Organisational Stakeholder Orientation Framework\nO’Higgins (2009) made another attempt to establish a link between stakeholder\nrelations management and organisational identity. Organisational stakeholder orientation\nresembles Brickson’s (2005) theorisation of organisational identity orientation. However, in\ncontrast with Brickson (2007), who described organisational identity orientation as a fairly\ndurable feature of identity, O’Higgins (2009) presented a more dynamic understanding of\nstakeholder orientation. In her view, organisational stakeholder orientation is more contextual,\ntemporal and potentially varying over time and causes. Her framework is based on a\nconfigurational approach and grounded in stakeholder theory (Donaldson & Preston, 1995;\nFreeman, 1984; Phillips, 2003). O’Higgins (2009) categorised organisations into four types\nwith respect to their orientations towards stakeholders.\nSceptical stakeholder orientation reflects organisational self-view as a profit-driven\nagent aimed for delivering benefits to its capital providers (Schneper & Guillen, 2004).\nSceptical orientation organisations do not recognise stakeholders other than shareholders\n(Letza et al., 2004), whom they give rights to participate in organisational profits. Other\nexternal constituencies sceptical organisations take into consideration only to the extent that\nthey support or constrain the attainment of their organisational objectives (Kaler, 2003).\nSceptical organisations are common within the controversial industries, such as tobacco,\ngaming or alcohol production. Stakeholder orientation of sceptical organisations could be\nfurther described as “coercion” (Stoney & Winstanley, 2001) or “reactivity” (Clarkson, 1991).\nSceptical organisations do not proactively pursue identification of stakeholder groups that may\nhinder their activities or management of their requests. Focused on maximising shareholder\nvalue creation, such enterprises address stakeholder interests within the limits of the existing\nlegislative obligations and industry requirements. Furthermore, sceptical organisations tend to\npractice moral relativism in their work towards attaining market goals and sustaining\n\n94\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\ncompetitive advantage. Kay (1997:135) described such organisations as “a group of people\nwho find it expedient every morning to renew their contracts with each other”.\nPragmatic stakeholder orientation stands for an instrumental approach to stakeholder\nrecognition. These organisations establish relationships with important counterparts, who can\nenhance or constrain their economic performance, to ensure the loyalty of these strategic\npartners. The instrumental approach of pragmatic organisations suggests devoting attention to\nthe needs of powerful stakeholders, who can have impact on the organisation’s ability to\nachieve its goals. Mitchell et al. (1997) claimed that salience of particular stakeholder groups\nderives from their power, legitimacy and urgency of their claims towards an organisation.\nOrganisations with pragmatic stakeholder orientation may ignore normative legitimacy of the\nless powerful claims, which often results in leaving unaddressed those causes that do not lead\ntowards increased profitability or productivity. Clarkson’s (1991) described such stakeholder\napproach as “defensive”, claiming that such organisations only do the necessary minimum in\naddressing wider causes that are not directly linked to their operations efficiency.\nThe philosophy of pragmatic organisations is close to sceptical in their single\nobjective stakeholder approach; however, pragmatic enterprises are pluralist in the ways they\naddress their counterparts. They use various approaches to interacting with powerful\nstakeholders and guiding their activism and often outsource this function to external mediators\n(Thomson & Bebbington, 2005). Pragmatic organisations are further likely to divert attention\nfrom stakeholders once their common interests cease to coincide (Steger et al., 2007).\nSceptical and pragmatic organisations consider themselves independent from wider\ncommunities in which they operate. Both sceptical and pragmatic organisations adhere to the\ntransactional approach to contractual relationships. In Brickson’s (2005) typology, they\ncorrelate with individualistic identity orientation in the sense that they predominantly focus\non their own prosperity.\nEngaged organisations take a step away from the unitary focus on financial resilience\nand put the community development goals at their core, therefore, adhering to the goals\nduality. Enterprises with engaged approach to stakeholder relations aim to achieve their\neconomic ends through the means that correspond to their purpose and values. Engaged\norganisations do not perceive financial and social objectives as a trade-off (DiNorcia & Tigner,\n2000), reaching out to various stakeholders with corresponding values. Engaged organisations\naccommodate the needs of their stakeholders, accept responsibilities towards communities in\nwhich they operate and proactively react to their responses. Unlike pragmatic organisations\nthat interact with stakeholders mainly for public relations or compliance reasons, engaged\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n95\n\nenterprises actively involve their stakeholders into solving common issues through dialogue\nand collective exploration (Roloff, 2008). Such enduring relations of engaged organisations\nwith their stakeholders often result in building durable communities of practice, which share\nknowledge, innovation and competencies (Roloff, 2008).\nThe engaged approach corresponds to relational identity orientation in Brickson’s\n(2005) framework, which involves building vigorous, long-term, resilient relationships with\nthe organisation’s partners. They also correlate with collectivistic identity orientation in their\nself-view as part of an extended community and individualistic orientation in their\nsimultaneous focus on the pursuit of financial gains. Davies (1999: 194) in his “Tomorrow’s\nCompany”, described such organisations as those that “treat stakeholders as the spokes of a\nwheel – all are needed to move forward and each takes the load in turn.” Engaged\norganisations acknowledge their mutual interdependence with internal and external\nstakeholders. They embrace the multiplicity of goals and plurality of legitimate stakeholders.\nWhereas being fully committed to developing communities in which they operate, engaged\norganisations devote equal attention to providing quality goods and services to achieve\neconomic resilience.\nContrary to previous two types, engaged organisations strictly adhere to their\nnormative obligations of fairly treating legitimate stakeholder groups and perceiving them as\nends in themselves. Engaged organisations integrate both power and legitimacy in their\nconsiderations of the stakeholder identification and salience. They equally consider the needs\nof different communities and may only subvert the rights of a legitimate stakeholder group in\nfavour of a more powerful one if it will generate longer-term beneficial consequences for the\nless powerful group with normative claims (O’Higgins, 2009). Engaged organisations devote\nparticular attention to their commitments towards employees, managers, capital providers and\nthe local community (Blair & Stout, 1999). Contrary to pragmatic organisations that adopt\ntemporary, discretionary normative attitudes towards stakeholders, which are not resistant to\neconomic pressures to abandon them, organisations with engaged stakeholder approach\ninstitutionalise their normative standing. If normative and instrumental goals of engaged\norganisations get in conflict, they will try to resolve it through cooperation with the affected\nstakeholders (Maharaj, 2008).\nIdealistic stakeholder orientation presumes a normative stance and full embracement\nof the needs of a wider community. The priority purpose of idealistic organisations is to serve\nthe community and to address stakeholder interests (Etzioni, 1998). Economic activities are\nconsidered secondary to this mission and as a means towards social ends. In case of a conflict\n\n96\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\nbetween instrumental and normative goals, idealistic organisations will take the normative\nsolution. Idealistic organisations perceive as legitimate stakeholders only groups and\nindividuals with normative claims on the organisation. Besides normative stakeholders with\nan interest in the organisation and affected by its operations, idealistic organisations extend\ntheir responsibilities towards all counterparts they would like to help and see themselves as\nfiduciaries for all of society (Kaler, 2003). However, idealistic organisations could also be\nestablished with the explicit commitment to serve a particular cause or stakeholder group.\nIn idealistic organisations, their community development mission defines their\nstakeholder orientation (Stoney & Winstanley, 2001). Their proactive support towards the\nextended stakeholder community goes beyond industry requirements (Clarkson, 1991). Such\nnormative stakeholder approach often becomes a constitutive part of their organisational\nidentity, as in case with many social entrepreneurs (Nicholls et al., 2015). Idealistic\norganisations measure the success of their activities in terms of the community needs\nsatisfaction and stakeholder benefit. Idealistic organisations endeavour the community\ndevelopment through selected activities and initiatives, which may or may not correlate with\ntheir main operations. In Brickson’s (2005) typology, idealistic organisations correspond to\ncollectivistic identity orientation, but paradoxically individualistic as well, due to the strong\nfocus on organisational uniqueness and “otherness”.\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n97\n\nTABLE 3.

(2010: 93) defined stakeholder orientation as “the organisational culture\nand behaviours that induce organisational members to be continuously aware of and\nproactively act on a variety of stakeholder issues.” Approaches to stakeholder engagement are\na way of expressing organisational identity (Berrone et al., 2007; Brickson, 2005, 2007) and\naccessing aspects of institutional logics embedded in an organisation (Jamali, 2008).\nStakeholder orientation types within both frameworks vary on multiple factors, such as\norganisational purpose, stakeholder identification and salience, performance evaluation and\n\n98\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\nboundaries between the organisation and its stakeholders (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). Different\norganisational purposes of the discussed types of organisations prescribe various criteria for\nidentifying relevant stakeholders and determine various degrees of stakeholder salience to the\norganisation in achieving its purpose. Furthermore, organisations assess their performance in\naccordance with their purpose and select stakeholder relations practices that are consistent\nwith their self-view.\nBoth frameworks represent a shift from the sole focus on organisation towards a\nnetwork-based, relational and process-oriented view of organisational stakeholder\nengagement (Andriof & Waddock, 2002). The above discussed organisational orientation\nframeworks use instrumental and normative stakeholder theories (Donaldson & Preston, 1995;\nFreeman, 1984) as key concepts to construct the configurations. They delineate a variety of\napproaches to organisational relations with stakeholders into a finite number of configurations\nthat explain their broad approaches. Each configuration consists of organisational features\nunique to that configuration (O’Higgins, 2009). This thesis acknowledges these considerable\nsimilarities and overlaps between the two perspectives and proceeds with the organisational\nidentity orientation approach due to its greater focus on organisational identity and stronger\nlinks to the organisational identity literature.\n\n3.6 Chapter Summary\nThis chapter introduced the concept of organisational identity and discussed the main\ntheoretical conceptualisations of organisational identity plurality as a way to capture the\n“hybrid” role of the firm as an economic and an ethical actor. The two perspectives, multiple\nidentities organisation theory and hybrid identity organisation theory, which are both rooted\nin Albert and Whetten’s work (1985), were presented and their main differences and\nsimilarities were discussed in order to find a way to synthesise the two approaches. It was\nfurther concluded that the existing literature has provided sufficient basis for conceptualising\norganisations as having more than one identity. An integrated process view of pluralistic\norganisational identity was developed to be applied to this study of sustainable finance and\nbanking organisations.\nOrganisations that combine multiple identities become subject to external demands\nfrom numerous distinct stakeholders and institutional logics that are understood as external\norders that determine norms and values, affect resource acquisition and employees attraction\nand provide field level instruments of promoting shared interests through collective behaviour.\nThis chapter analysed implications of identity plurality for organisations and discussed how\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\n99\n\nvarious aspects of organisational identity affect the ways organisational members perceive\ninstitutional demands and respond to them. It was further proposed that organisational identity\ncould serve as a filter, which determines how organisational members perceive, depict and\nreact to institutional demands associated with the economic and the ethical roles of the firm\n(Besharov & Brickson, 2016). Therefore, it was concluded that serving as a filter, pluralistic\nidentity has potential to synthesise the demands of the economic and the ethical roles within\nsustainable banks.\nThe next chapter will cover methodological aspects of this study. It will outline the\nresearch design, including data collection and analysis, which were adopted to explore how\nsustainable banks perceive and resolve identity plurality and simultaneously perform as the\neconomic and the ethical actors.\n\n100\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH AGENDA\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nMETHODOLOGY\nResearch Design, Data Collection and Analysis\n\n4.1 Research Philosophy\nThis chapter outlines the research purpose and research questions of this thesis and\nprovides a comprehensive explanation of the research methodology adopted to investigate the\nrole of identity in simultaneous pursuit of the economic and the ethical goals within sustainable\nbanks as pluralistic identity organisations. Detailed account of the research methodology\nincludes the adopted research philosophy and approach, comprehensive research design,\nwhich explains the techniques used for data collection and analysis, and notes on ethical\nconsiderations and research credibility.\n\n4.1.1 Research paradigm\nThomas Kuhn first used the word paradigm in his “The Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions” (1962) to mark a particular philosophical stance or way of thinking. The word\nhas Greek origin and means “pattern”. In the organisational research, the term paradigm stands\nfor the researcher’s worldview throughout their research process (Mackenzie & Knipe, 2006)\nand reflects the “basic belief system or worldwide view that guides the investigator” (Guba &\nLincoln, 1994: 105). This perspective is comprised of four elements, namely ontology,\nepistemology, methodology and axiology, which together constitute the research paradigm\n(Lincoln & Guba, 1990; Sobh & Perry, 2006). Awareness of one’s philosophical assumptions\nis widely acknowledged to increase the quality of research and contribute to the creativity of\nresearcher. Moreover, research paradigm forms the basis for research design (Denzin &\nLincoln, 2005) and, therefore, should be addressed before research is undertaken.\nDifferences among research paradigms could be addressed more formally by\nconsidering their epistemological and ontological stances. Epistemology is used to describe\nwhat counts as knowledge within the world (Cooksey & McDonald, 2011) and is concerned\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n101\n\nwith the nature of knowledge claims. It answers the following questions: What are the sources\nof knowledge? How reliable are these sources? Research paradigms could vary from the\nposition that facts and values are distinct and scientific knowledge consists only of facts, to\nthe idea that facts and values are intertwined and hard to disentangle or the view that scientific\nknowledge is ideological and inevitably conducive to particular sets of social ends. Ontology\nis concerned with the nature of reality and relates to whether one believes there is one\nverifiable reality, which is independent of our construction of it, or whether there exist multiple\nsocially constructed realities (Patton, 2002). Research methodology should reflect the above\ndiscussed assumptions about the nature of reality and knowledge, values and theory and\npractice on the particular research phenomenon.\nThe positivism paradigm is an empirical approach, which states that science is the only\nfoundation of true knowledge and makes a strict distinction between the empirical knowledge\nand the knowledge derived from “metaphysical speculation” (Schwandt, 2001: 199). The\npositivist worldview is objective and not prejudged by theoretical notions, it advocates for\ninvestigating the social world with the methods, techniques and procedures adopted from\nnatural sciences (Bell & Bryman, 2007). Positivists considered knowledge as those statements\nof belief or fact that can be tested empirically, confirmed, verified or disconfirmed and\ngeneralised (Eichelberger, 1989). In the organisational studies, positivism paradigm has been\nwidely applied in quantitative studies based on large data samples. Other researchers, however,\nargued that the positivism stance excludes “the dimension of discovery” (Guba & Lincoln,\n1994) and is fairly unsuitable for studying humans in complex social settings (Sobh & Perry,\n2006).\nSocial sciences offered an alternative constructivism paradigm, which differs from\npositivism on the assumptions about the nature of reality, what counts as knowledge and its\nsources, values and their role in the research process. The social constructivist approach\nclaimed that reality is socially constructed (Creswell, 2003) and acknowledged the importance\nof subjective meanings held by the studied actors (Saunders, Lewis & Thornhill, 2009). Social\nconstructivists proposed that the truth lies within the human experience, and knowledge is\nsocially constructed and mind dependent, and, therefore, subjective. This stance further stated\nthat social inquiry is value-bound and value-laden, and the purpose of research is to understand\nhuman experiences. Social constructivism is commonly adopted by qualitatively rich studies\nbecause it builds on an inductive approach and is particularly well suited for theory building\npurposes (Easterby-Smith, Thorpe & Lowe, 2002).\nA further research paradigm is critical realism, which could be positioned between the\nstances of positivism and social constructivism (Guba, 1990). Critical realism could be\n\n102\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\ndescribed as a less strict or, as labelled by Crotty (1998: 29), a “less arrogant” form of\npositivism. Indeed, this paradigm turned the emphasis from absolute certainty to probability\nand allowed for a certain level of subjectivity rather than absolute objectivity. This stance\nacknowledged that reality exists independently from researcher and a phenomenon could exist\nin human minds, as well as in the objective world (Miles & Huberman, 1994). Therefore, the\nreality cannot be known with certainty, as observations are theory driven and influenced by\nthe observer’s biases and worldview (Guba & Lincoln, 1994). However, critical realism also\nmoved away from the social constructionism paradigm by emphasising that the reality cannot\nbe assessed directly (Easterby-Smith, Thorpe & Lowe, 2002) and phenomena are concept\ndependent, so causal explanations are needed to understand them (Sayer, 2000).\nCritical realism accounts for both the context and scientific explanations, as it aims to\nexplain the phenomena under study, as well as the data collected (Easton, 2010). It differs\nfrom the previously acknowledged approaches in its acceptance of the multiplicity of research\nmethods (both quantitative and qualitative), which should be selected based on the nature of\nobjects of study and research questions (Sayer, 2000). The critical realist approach allows for\ntriangulation of different data sources, which particularly benefits the qualitative case study\nmethod and allows the researcher to take advantage of rich qualitative data coming from\ninterviews, observations, focus groups and document analysis (Yin, 2009). This thesis aims to\nexplore and understand the role of identity in the sustainable pursuit of the community\ndevelopment and the banking logics. The critical realist stance allows this context to be\ninvestigated by interacting with members of the GABV and exploring their perceptions, whilst\nalso triangulating other data sources.\n\n4.1.2 Qualitative approach\nThis study adopts a qualitative approach to explore the role of identity in the successful\nexperience of combining the banking and the community development logics within the\nGABV. Qualitative research refers to “the meanings, concepts definitions, characteristics,\nmetaphors, symbols and description of things” and not to their “counts or measures” (Berg &\nLune, 2012:3). There have been multiple calls within the identity research for further studies\nthat would explore “why” and “how” questions, which require a more holistic approach to\ndata collection and analysis (Gioia et al., 2010; Pratt, 2012). The qualitative approach is\nparticularly well positioned to help researchers uncover the relationships, observe longitudinal\nprocesses and demonstrate connections between specific events (Miles & Huberman, 1994).\nZalan and Lewis (2004: 512) further suggested that “whenever a holistic, dynamic and\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n103\n\ncontextual explanation of the phenomenon is required, qualitative methods would be most\nappropriate methodological choices.”\nThe main purpose of a qualitative inquiry is to explore the nature of phenomenon,\nwhich could be best achieved through personal contact with the field or organisation. In\nqualitative studies, data is mediated through the “human instrument” and the research itself is\nconsidered to be “an instrument of data collection” (Lincoln & Denzin, 2003). Unlike other\nresearch approaches that seek independent “realities” through “objective” observations,\nqualitative research locates “the observer in the world” (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005: 2) and\nacknowledges that there is a “relationship between the researcher and the researched”\n(Ormston et al., 2014: 8). Qualitative approach enables researchers to observe, describe and\nexplain processes within dynamic environments (Zalan & Lewis, 2004). The role of the\nresearcher in a qualitative study is to develop a deep understanding of insights, nuances and\ncomplexity of the research context (Lincoln & Denzin, 2003). Qualitative approach involves\na more inductive approach and, therefore, is often used to explore and generate new theoretical\nconcepts and claims (Johnson, Christensen & Kagermann, 2008).\nForeman and Whetten (2016) claimed that even though the concept of organisational\nidentity has been thoroughly examined from a conceptual perspective, there has been a lack\nof attention to the methodological concerns. In their comprehensive overview of the ways to\noperationalise and empirically observe organisational identity, they provided sufficient\nguidelines for adopting a qualitative approach to identity studies and reminded that “collective\nunderstanding of organisational identity has benefited from such a diverse set of research\nmethods” (Ibid: 60). The authors further suggested that the most promising path for advancing\norganisational identity studies should involve more complex research designs with multiple\nmethods and measures. The qualitative approach has proved to be well suited to explore\nidentity processes at organisational level within diverse national contexts (e.g., Battilana &\nDorado, 2010; Pache & Santos, 2012; etc.). Therefore, this thesis adopts a qualitative approach\nbecause the aim is to gain a deep understanding of identity within the GABV, an alliance of\norganisations representing different institutional and socio-cultural settings. The qualitative\napproach allows examining in-depth my purposive sample (Yin, 1989) to better understand\nthe phenomenon.\n\n104\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n4.1.3 Abductive approach\nA key question for researchers within any paradigm concerns the role of theory in their\nstudies. Handling of theory and relating findings back to previous studies determines whether\na research could be considered inductive or deductive (Bell & Bryman, 2007). Eisenhardt\n(1989b) identified three distinct uses of theory: (1) as an initial guide to research design and\ndata collection; (2) as part of an iterative process of data collection and analysis; and (3) as a\nfinal product of the research. The motivation for the use of theory to drive qualitative research\ndesign is to create an initial theoretical framework, which will take into account previous\nliterature and create a sensible theoretical basis to inform early stages of the empirical work.\nIn the deductive approach theory guides data collection process and aims to answer research\nquestions based on the theoretical considerations. A researcher using the deductive approach\nwould deduce a particular hypothesis by reviewing and recognising a particular theory, which\nserves as basis for the data collection process (Bell & Bryman, 2007). Although theory can\nprovide a valuable initial guidance, it poses a risk for the researcher to see only what the theory\nsuggests and, therefore, leave potential new issues and avenues of exploration unattended. It\nis desirable in qualitative studies to preserve a considerable degree of openness to the collected\ndata and a willingness to adjust initial assumptions informed by theory. This would usually\ninvolve an iterative process of data collection and analysis, with initial theories being revised,\nexpanded or abandoned (Walsham, 1995). With respect to the theory as the final product of\nresearch, Eisenhardt suggested that qualitative research could be used to generate concepts,\nconceptual frameworks, propositions or mid-range theories. In the inductive approach, which\naims to explore and describe research phenomenon in-depth (Miles & Huberman, 1994), the\ntheory would be used after observations and findings have been collected. Even though\nEisenhardt herself explicitly stated her epistemological position as positivism, her views of the\nrole of theory were accepted by many qualitative researchers, and the idea of theory as a\ndesirable final product of case study research has spread.\nDespite the clear difference between the role of theory in inductive and deductive\napproaches, Bell and Bryman (2007) stressed that each inductive research involves some\ndegree of deduction. The authors emphasised that researchers using inductive approach engage\nin relating and comparing observations with theory and moving back and forth between the\ncollected data and previous literature, which reflects on a deductive approach. Even though\nthe inductive approach supposes that findings are not pre-empted by any theory, Miles and\nHuberman (1994) emphasised the importance of familiarising oneself with theory prior to data\ncollection, which clearly advocates for the deductive approach (Sobh & Perry, 2006).\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n105\n\nThe abductive approach is set to address the weaknesses associated with the deductive\nand the inductive research. It has gained popularity within social studies, sometimes referred\nto as the “abductive turn” (Bonfantini, 1988). A researcher following the abductive stance\nseeks to find the best possible explanation for a phenomenon among available\nconceptualisations. Abductive studies are generally characterised by close connection between\nresearch design, research questions, methodology, analysis and interpretation. Thus, Yin\n(1994: 52) suggested that “a case study design is not something completed only at the outset\nof a study,” and Bryman (2003) described qualitative research as a process of simultaneous\nformulation of theory and collection of data. One of the major differences from deductive and\ninductive studies is the role of framework, which in abductive studies is re-worked and\nmodified both based on empirical findings and theoretical insights gained during the research\nprocess (Dubois & Gadde, 2002).\nThis qualitative study is exploratory in nature and adopts an abductive research\napproach. It was commenced with a deductive approach by reviewing multiple concepts of\npluralistic organisational identity in literature in order to reduce the bias. It then moved to a\nmore inductive approach for my data collection process, in which research themes were\nexplored with openness, but guided by the initial conceptual understandings. After the data\ncollection, the research findings were related back to the previously reviewed literature and\nthus again adopted a deductive approach to discuss the findings. Hence, it could be concluded\nthat the research followed an abductive approach (deductive-inductive-deductive), which\nenabled the awareness and acknowledgement of the existing theoretical developments, whilst\nalso allowing them to be further explored and extended.\n\n4.2 Research design\nResearch design represents a detailed framework of the study and determines data\ncollection techniques (Bell & Bryman, 2007). This study follows an exploratory research\ndesign using the case study method aimed at achieving a deep understanding of the pluralistic\norganisational identity within the sustainable banking setting. The case study design is\nrecommended for investigating specific cases, such as “individual, group, organisational,\nsocial, political and related phenomena” (Yin, 2009: 4), and is appropriate when the aim is to\nexplore the research object in detail (Ghauri, 2004). This thesis, therefore, applies the case\nstudy design using the techniques of interviews, participant observations and document\nanalysis.\n\n106\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nEisenhardt (1989b: 534) defined the case study approach as “a research strategy,\nwhich focuses on understanding the dynamics present within single settings.” Vissak (2010:\n37) emphasised that case studies are appropriate for “several purposes, including theory\ngeneration, testing, refutation, refining and prediction.” The case study method is believed to\nbe particularly useful for studying contemporary phenomena as it allows for the discovery of\ncasual relationships through longitudinal processes, states, events and their outcomes\n(Bromley, 1986; Yin, 2009). Case study is a suitable approach for research aiming at\nanswering “how” and “why” types of questions (Yin, 1994; Ghauri, 2004) in studies of\ninterpretive and explanatory nature (Yin, 1989; Walsham, 1995; Yin & Davis, 2007). The case\nstudy method could stimulate research in areas, where current theories have failed (Yin, 2009)\nor where theory is being built (Ghauri, 2004). The case study method enables in-depth\nexploration of the phenomenon and provides basis for investigation of subtle similarities and\ndifference among cases (Eisenhardt, 1989b; Yin, 1989). Miles and Huberman (1994: 29)\nfurther claimed that when we look at “a range of similar and contrasting cases, we can\nunderstand a single-case finding, grounding it by specifying how and where and, if possible,\nwhy it carries on as it does.”\nPrevious research suggested that the case study approach could be applied to\norganisational studies as a motivation or an illustration (Siggelkow, 2007). Firstly, case studies\ncould be a great way to motivate authors’ research questions and persuade readers and\nreviewers that their conceptual argument is an important phenomenon. Though much of the\nacademic research developed from primarily theoretical motivations of the authors, it can be\nargued that inspiration derived from a real-world story or situation has more appeal and\npotential for making a conceptual contribution. Secondly, case studies could be employed as\nan illustration – “a concrete example of every construct that is employed in a conceptual\nargument” (Ibid: 22). In this role, cases could help authors get a fuller understanding of the\nphenomena they study, provide more persuasive evidence about the underlying causal forces\nand ensure that their conclusions and conceptual arguments move beyond the purely\nspeculative stage.\nOrganisational studies, as well as other academic literature, have long been engaged\nin the on-going debate about the comparative value of different research approaches. There\nare various advantages of applying the case study research design to organisational studies.\nFirstly, this approach enables a process review, which is necessary when studying identity on\nthe organisational level and allows for direct observation and interaction with the real case\nsetting (Ghauri & Grønhaug, 2010). Secondly, case studies have a proven potential to deepen\nour understanding of the research phenomena encouraging theory testing and theory building\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n107\n\n(Yin, 2009). The case study method permits the collection of detailed descriptive data, usually\nqualitative in nature, and provides an excellent opportunity to keep asking questions until\nsufficient answers have been obtained (Ghauri, 2004). As noted by Siggelkow (2007: 22),\n“getting closer to constructs and being able to illustrate causal relationships more directly are\namong the key advantages of case research”. Thirdly, Yin (1994) suggested that the use of the\ncase study method is particularly beneficial, when an international component, such as\nmultiple national settings, is involved. The case study research design, therefore, appears well\nsuited for my research, which involves a substantial degree of contextualisation due to the data\ncollection being conducted in cross-border and cross-cultural settings (Ghauri, 2004).\nAlthough the case study research design has a number of proven advantages, its\napplication could also be constrained by certain shortcomings (Vissak, 2010). Firstly, casebased researchers often feel obliged to defend themselves against the charge of nonrepresentativeness. To sustain the non-representativeness argument, organisations included in\nthe sample need to be very special, carefully selected cases, which have potential, in the eyes\nof the researcher, to allow them to gain certain insights that other organisations would not be\nable to provide (Siggelkow, 2007). The choice of the case study methodology could be further\nsupported if this method enables particular insights that allow drawing inferences about more\n“normal” organisations. Secondly, the case study method often has been criticised for its\narguable descriptiveness and lack of generalisability (Siggelkow, 2007). Although case studies\nhave proved to allow access to rich, in-depth and high-quality data, they are often criticised\nfor findings that cannot be replicated or further checked against the reliability measures. To\naccount for this limitation, Miles and Huberman (1994) suggested that the generalisability of\ncase study results should be referred to as analytical generalisation, which could contribute to\ntheory building and could help generalise findings to a specific theory (Yin, 2009). Thirdly,\nMiles and Huberman (1994) further warned that the case study method involves practical and\ncoordination problems. The case study research is based on synthesis of multiple data sources,\nsuch as interview transcripts, observation notes, supporting documents and organisations’\nreports. This makes the case study research “time-consuming and labour-intensive” (Vissak,\n2010: 374), usually involving hours of interviews and observations associated with high data\ncollection costs. Data analysis of qualitative cases further involves extensive and costly\ntranscribing. Finally, Scapens (2004) cautioned that case studies require clear research\nquestions and thorough comprehensive understanding of the existing literature. This method\ndemands researchers to analyse large amounts of diverse data and analytically combine them\nto draw conclusions (Scapens, 2004; Ghauri, 2004), and, therefore, necessitates excellent\ncommunication skills. Yin (1984) confirmed that the case study approach is remarkably\n\n108\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\ndifficult to conduct, despite traditionally being classified as “soft” research. He pointed out\nthat “the ‘softer’ the research technique, the harder it is to do so” (Ibid: 26).\nThe existing literature distinguished between single and multiple case study designs,\nwhich could further be holistic or have embedded sub-cases within an overall holistic case.\nThus, Yin (2009) identified the following four types of the case study designs: 1) holistic\nsingle case, 2) embedded single case, 3) multiple cases with one unit of analysis and 4)\nmultiple cases with multiple units of analysis. This research employs the single case study\napproach with embedded sub-cases (individual banks) within an overall holistic case (the\nGABV). Identity research has been often criticised for giving limited attention to the\norganisational level of analysis compared to the individual level (Gioia et al., 2010), which\nresulted in limited understanding of pluralistic organisational identity as a phenomenon.\nMoreover, the majority of studies researched identity at a single level (Pratt, 2012; Kreiner et\nal., 2015). This study adopts the organisational level research to explore sustainable banking\nidentity within the GABV. As a result, the data was collected at the GABV member banks as\norganisational subunits standing for the organisational level to gain a comprehensive\nunderstanding of pluralistic organisational identity of the GABV.\nThe first step in the case study approach requires selecting the research setting. Ghauri\n(2004) emphasised that the case selection rational should be guided by the research problem\nand research questions. Cooper (1984) further suggested that the easiest accessible population\nshould be prioritised, as it is advantageous to include participants with evident interest in the\nproposed study. Ghauri (2004) also noted the significance of time and funding considerations\nfor the case study research. For this thesis, the GABV has been selected as the single case\nstudy. Firstly, contact with the GABV Executive Director Dr Marcos Eguiguren has been\nestablished with the help of my primary research supervisor Prof. Kenneth Amaeshi.\nFollowing the personal contact, a formal research proposal has been submitted to the GABV\nSecretariat outlining the research purpose and objectives. The research proposal has been\nshared with the member banks through an internal online platform to inform them of the study\nand to recruit research participants. Twelve banks responded to this call for research\nparticipants and after discussing the research proposal at their board meetings it resulted in\nformal agreements to participate in the study. This allowed the data collection through\ninterviews to begin in 2016.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n109\n\n4.3 Data Collection\nThe field of sustainable finance and banking provides fertile ground to explore the\nphenomenon of pluralistic identity organisations and its theoretical underpinnings. This study\naims for “theoretical extension,” a term used to describe qualitative studies focused on\n“broadening the relevance of a particular concept or theoretical system to a range of empirical\ncontexts other than those in which they were first developed or intended to be used” (Snow,\nMorrill, & Anderson, 2003: 187). Given the scarcity of the empirical scholarly research on\ntheoretical tenets associated with pluralistic identity organisations (Pratt & Foreman, 2000), a\nqualitative case study of a specific organisation within the industry was conducted (Yin, 2008),\na method proven to be well suited for elaborating on the existing theories of organisations\n(e.g., Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Glynn, 2000). Although constraining the focus to one\ncommunity within the global financial market (i.e., sustainable banks, members of the GABV)\nlimited the generalisability of the findings, it allowed to generate much richer insights into the\nidentity challenges, processes and outcomes within my empirical setting. The primary goal in\nthis study is not replicability but exploring the role of identity in sustaining the duality of the\ncommunity development and the banking goals within the sustainable banking field.\nThe data was collected from multiple sources, following what Creswell (2003) called\na triangulation approach, in which multiple methods, data sources and units of analysis are\nused to evaluate a set of theorised relationships within a single study. A variety of primary\ndata sources were used (semi-structured interviews, participant observation) and\ncomplemented them with a substantial amount of secondary data sources (combined annual\nreports of the GABV and its member banks, archival interviews, corporate websites, banks’\ninternal documents, etc.). The full set of data sources used for this study is presented in Table\n4, which summarises the details on every source used, including the detailed description of\ndata, its quantity and type.\n\n110\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nTABLE 4.

The study followed the successful\nexperience of previous research that utilised the qualitative analysis to study the content and\nbehaviours of organisational identity within pluralistic identity organisations (e.g., Battilana&\nDorado, 2010; Brickson, 2005; Golden-Biddle & Rao, 1997; Pratt & Rafaeli, 1997). It relied on\ninterviews as the main source of data on pluralistic organisational identity content and behaviours.\nThis study aimed at obtaining views and perspectives of board directors, as they occupy a key\nposition in the organisational decision-making process and possess a subtle understanding about\norganisational values, mission and vision (Sobh & Perry, 2006). Overall, data sources included\nwritten and oral stories told by the GABV banks and shared through their published documents\nabout the work they do to improve the quality of life for individuals and communities in which\nthey operate. Document analysis and participant observations helped develop initial\nunderstanding of the sustainable banking identity and its implications for the GABV members,\nwhereas interviews allowed me to achieve a deeper understanding of the sustainable banking\nidentify and to clarify ambiguous points. Participant observations and documentation data also\nserved as important triangulation materials and supplementary sources for understanding the\nphenomenon and its presentation to various constituencies including discrepancies among\nparticipants’ perspectives, as well as the means of gaining additional perspectives on the key\nissues (Jick, 1979; Miles & Huberman, 1994).\n\n112\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n4.3.1 Interviews\nThe primary data sources for this study were semi-structured interviews conducted with\nboard directors from a diverse selection of the GABV banks from 2016 to 2019. The purpose of\nthese interviews was to gather information from actors about the perceived sustainable banking\nidentity and its implications for these pluralistic identity organisations. Semi-structured\ninterviews were employed at the beginning to provide as wide a scope as possible for data\ncollection. Fontana and Frey (2000: 663) defined interviews as “negotiated accomplishments of\nboth interviewers and respondents that are shaped by the contexts and situations in which they\ntake place.” Qualitative interviews have been further described as “the most direct, researchfocused interaction between research and participant” (Kazmer & Xie, 2008: 258), and praised\nfor their high potential to “enter into the other person's perspective” (Patton, 2002: 341) and\ndevelop “thick descriptions of a given social world analysed for cultural patterns and themes”\n(Warren, 2002: 85). Interviews are one of the most widespread and acknowledged methods in the\nqualitative research (Myears & Newman, 2007; Bell & Bryman, 2007; Ryan et al., 2009). They\nare considered a central resource for social science, which is preferred by many scholars for its\nability to gather rich empirical data (Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007; Crow, 2013).\nBurgess (1982: 107) emphasised that interviews give the researcher an opportunity to\n“probe deeply, to uncover new clues, open up new dimensions of a problem.” Moreover,\ninterviews could be superior to alternative qualitative research techniques as they allow common\nthemes to be established between respondents (Warren, 2001). This method further encourages\nthe researcher to focus and elaborate on the emerging themes that they find most promising and\nimportant for answering the research questions, thereby, directing the researcher to follow the\nperspective of the participant. Most qualitative studied employed semi-structured and\nunstructured interviews, whereas structured interviews with a sequence of questions asked in the\nsame order and the same way of all subjects of the research are more applicable to the surveybased approaches. Semi-structured interviews allow for certain flexibility (Bell & Bryman, 2007),\nas the researcher can direct and alter the sequence of questions, paraphrase and repeat questions\nwhere necessary. Semi-structured questions were chosen for the purposes of this research to\nenable participants to elaborate and expand on specific questions, which they felt were relevant\nto the research topic, and to ask participants about their opinions on certain events (Yin, 2009).\nMoreover, the researcher had an opportunity to follow up on comments, which were found\nrelevant to the studied phenomenon (Bell & Bryman, 2007).\nInterviews lasted from 45 to 80 minutes, were audio recorded (when possible) and\ntranscribed for further qualitative analysis. Interviews could be done through the means of email,\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n113\n\nphone or video conference or in person (Ghauri & Grønhaug, 2010). In this study, the latter two\nmethods were used and, more specifically, 34 out of 51 were video conference interviews and\nseventeen were in-person interviews. The initial interview protocol was largely standardised\nacross the participants and the questions asked were determined beforehand in a form of an\ninterview guide, with some customisation for particular roles and contexts. Open-ended questions\nallowed me to gain insights that are more accurate, gather more detailed information about the\nparticipants’ perspectives and capture nuances, such as altitudinal, personal and value-laden\nmaterial (Knight & Arkesey, 1999; Oltmann, 2016). Board directors from twelve GABV member\nbanks across ten different countries were interviewed, as well as the GABV Secretariat\nemployees. Interviewing the Alliance members from different levels, who have different roles\nand degrees of involvement with the GABV movement, together with conducting interviews at\ndifferent regional chapters of the GABV, allowed to gain a holistic understanding of the identity\ncontent and behaviours that are taking place.\nInterview questions were formulated in accordance with the research aims and questions\n(Yin, 2009) and based on the existing literature, reviewed at the initial stage of the research. By\nfamiliarising with the relevant literature beforehand, deep conceptual understanding of the\nresearch topic was gained, which was necessary for successful interviewing (Miles & Huberman,\n1994). The interview guide helped me ensure that all main research questions were covered\nthroughout the interview process, whilst remaining flexible to follow up on the most interesting\nand relevant interviewees’ responses. Questions for the interview guide were formulated with a\nprocess questioning language based on Pettigrew et al. (2001) of “what”, “how”, “why” and\n“where”. The complete interview protocol could be found in Appendix 4.\nCompared to the early interviews, subsequent interviews were becoming progressively\nmore structured as themes started emerging from the data. This progressive focusing of the\ninterviews allowed for targeted data collection in my attempts to identify patterns, consistencies\nand inconsistencies across the Alliance, as well as tentative relations among the concepts. To\nminimise the possibility that interview questions in follow-up interviews with the same\nparticipant might bias members’ responses towards the evolving interpretations, issues raised by\nother participants were identified and used terms generated by the participants to frame questions,\nbefore raising questions to follow up on issues identified by the same interviewee. Long breaks\n(often months) between interviews also served to reduce the bias.\n\n114\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n4.3.2 Cross-cultural interviewing\nCross-cultural interviews involve a researcher and an interviewee from different\nbackgrounds, who might not share common assumptions about meanings (Schneider, 2011).\nConducting cross-cultural interviews in countries with different languages requires the researcher\nto take into account linguistic considerations. As the researcher speaks both English and Spanish\n(as the second and the third languages), the access and interview language for the Latin American\nChapter within the GABV was Spanish. This allowed participants to respond in their mother\ntongue, which is considered a linguistic advantage (Marschan-Piekkari & Reis, 2004), and\nallowed to avoid using help of an interpreter in cases when the respondents did not speak English.\nMarschan-Piekkari and Reis (2004: 224) further argued that in cross-cultural interviews, the\n“choice and use of language, as well as the researcher’s and the interviewee’s language skills,\naffect the dynamics in various ways.” Therefore, depending on the respondent’s native language,\nthe interview was conducted either in English or in Spanish.\nAlthough English language is often promoted by journals and other researchers as an\nappropriate interview language, Marschan-Piekkari and Reis (2004) argued for a multilingual\napproach to have certain advantages over a unilingual English-dominated approach. Firstly, as\nthe topics addressed were complex and required sufficient understanding of the subject, research\nbenefited from allowing participants to express themselves more naturally and freely in their\nnative language. Marschan-Piekkari and Reis (2004) observed that non-native speakers might be\nuncomfortable discussing issues outside their immediate narrow area of expertise due to the\nterminological struggle. Secondly, addressing interviewees in their native language allows\navoiding the problem described by Murray and Wynne (2001), who argued that respondents could\nperceive themselves as less educated and confident, if they start facing difficulties speaking a\nsecond language during the interview. Wright (2004: 59) similarly argued that “cross-cultural\nstudies should not be carried out in unilingual English fashion.” To support the interview process,\nthe interview guide was prepared in both English and Spanish, which helped me control the\ninterview process in terms of terminology, ask questions in a more suitable way, quicker react on\nnew developments and build trust faster (Ghauri, 2004).\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n115\n\n4.3.3 Participant observations\nParticipant observations facilitate the data collection during social interactions as they\nnaturally occur rather than in artificial situations, which help researchers capture less evident and\nsubjective elements of the observed phenomena. Yin (1994: 94) claimed that participant\nobservations provide “unusual opportunities for collecting case study data... [as it allows] to gain\naccess to events or groups that are otherwise inaccessible to scientific investigation”. Participation\nobservations further provide researchers wth access to contextualised detailed information and\ndeep knowledge of the field, which is vivid to the observer. They make available unique\ninformation that is difficult to capture by other methods, for instance on the activity functions,\nspecific strategic choices of the involved actors and interactions of actors with each other.\nData collection was supported by undertaking participant observations during the GABV\nGoverning Board Forum annual meetings in Copenhagen, Denmark (2015) and Katmandu, Nepal\n(2016). In addition, several regional branches of the GABV member banks were visited, which\nallowed me to do observations of the daily operations of sustainable banks and daily work of their\nemployees. Finally, the researcher has been a customer of one of the European GABV banks\nsince the start of this research project and has therefore been exposed to multiple forms of\ncommunication. The researcher also kept a notebook at all times and wrote down observations\nthat were later followed up in the interviews. Many informal conversations with board directors,\nco-workers1, affiliated researchers and partners that occurred during the observation periods were\nrecorded in field notes.\nThe Governing Board Forum (GBF), an expert-led Community of Practice, was initiated\nduring the 2015 GABV Annual Meeting in Paris. The Regional Chapter meeting at Merkur\nCooperative Bank in November 2015 marked the first in-person meeting of banking professionals\nwithin the GABV. The GBF has been built to provide each member bank with an opportunity to\nnetwork, share and learn about governance systems, challenges and opportunities. Hosted by the\nGABV member, Merkur Cooperative Bank (Denmark), participants gained insights into the\nMerkur ́s work, visited its headquarters and some project sites. Attendees also received an update\non the current GABV developments and broadened their network by meeting members of the\nparallel GABV European Chapter Meeting. A group of 19 participants, the GABV members and\nCEOs of European member banks, met to discuss current challenges of the European banking\nsector. Participating in this meeting allowed me to meet many board directors and the Secretariat\n\n1\n\nThe term deliberately used by the GABV banks to address their employees, managers, elected board\ndirectors and other organisational members.\n\n116\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nmembers in person, conducts a number of pilot interviews, arrange for further interviews and\nidentify additional persons to contact for participation in my study. The researcher was able to\nattend the meetings together with board directors, observe and participate in their discussions,\nmake notes on the issues related to my research questions and record comments.\nDuring the spring of 2017, the GABV member banks’ board directors gathered again in\nNepal to reflect on their path to membership expansion and explore the challenges ahead. They\nbuilt upon a significant commitment made during previous meetings in Copenhagen and\nAmsterdam (2016, not attended by the researcher). The theme of the event was “Shifting the\nFinancial Paradigm: Courage to Act Together”. The CEOs described the challenge shared by the\nGABV members and partners to transform the financial system with concrete and oriented\nactions, while also having an element of self-reliance, especially for members and their work\nwithin the communities they serve. The discussions centred on the work that should be done to\nface challenges from outside the sustainable banking community. Participants put a special focus\non reinforcing the core role as bankers devoted to changing the financial system in a positive way.\nThe meeting was hosted by NMB Bank, represented by its CEO Upendra Poudyal. In his opening\nspeech, he shared how the banks of the GABV have shown remarkable resiliency in the face of\nfinancial adversity and highlighted how banks that follow values-based principles do not face\nproblems during economic downturns. The meeting was attended by Nepal’s Prime Minister\nPushpa Kamal Dahal, who delivered a powerful message in which he called for action on building\na banking environment that puts people before profit to generate employment and help\ncommunities to become self-reliant.\n\n4.3.4 Document analysis\nIn addition to interviews and participant observations, this research adopted a third related\ntechnique of documents analysis (Yin, 2009). The researcher was often directed to particular\nrelevant documents by the interviewees, such as the GABV policy documents, reports and\nregional chapters’ presentations. However, multiple secondary sources of information of the\nresearcher’s choice were also gathered, such as combined annual reports, research articles,\nsuccess stories, client interviews and online sources including websites of the GABV and its\nmember banks. These documents are considered to supplement the evidence gathered from\ninterviews (Ghauri, 2004) and to provide relevant details, such as names and events over long\nperiods (Yin, 2009). All these sources allowed me to obtain additional information on the\norganisational identity content and behaviours within the GABV. Moreover, the GABV provided\nthe researcher with access to certain internal documents, therefore allowing the inclusion of very\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n117\n\naccurate sources, which are likely to help reduce the bias and increase the trustworthiness. The\ninclusion of documents proved to be very relevant as it provided additional information about the\nGABV values, principles and working ethics, which was not necessarily covered in such a detail\nthrough the interview process. Relevant secondary sources available were thoroughly read prior\nto each interview to partly answer the questions of interest, which were then double-checked with\nthe participants. By gathering these important sources beforehand, the researcher’s interest in the\nAlliance and her understanding of the topics of sustainable finance and banking were\ndemonstrated, which was always well received by the interviewees.\n\n4.3.5 Triangulation\nThe inclusion of multiple sources of evidence in research design is recommended to\nincrease confidence in the findings and assure the validity of the case study method (Yin, 2009).\nThe technique adopted in this study, triangulation, was defined by Denzin (1978:291) as “the\ncombination of methodologies in the study of the same phenomenon.” It strengthened this case\nstudy research by using multiple data sources to facilitate deeper understanding of the\nphenomenon (Patton, 2002). Denzin (1978) and Patton (1999) identified four types of\ntriangulation: 1) data triangulation (triangulation of different sources); 2) investigator\ntriangulation (triangulation of different researchers); 3) theory triangulation (triangulation of\ndifferent perspectives) and 4) methodological triangulation (triangulation of different research\nmethods).\nThis research applied the approach of data triangulation and the techniques of interviews,\nobservations and documents analysis (Denzin, 1978; Yin, 2009). It enabled me to strengthen data\nanalysis by checking and validating information from multiple sources (Ghauri & Grønhaug,\n2010). Yin (2009) claimed that data triangulation has more is stronger at reassuring the research\nquality compared with single source cases. The drawback of using data triangulation is the timeconsuming nature of the process and research expenses associated with conducting interviews\nand observations in different settings. Furthermore, it required me to be able to analyse all\ndifferent sources, which took both analytical and linguistic skills, as data had been collected in\nEnglish and Spanish languages.\n\n118\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n4.4 Data Analysis\nAccording to Marshall and Rossman (1995: 111), “data analysis is the process of bringing\norder, structure and meaning to the mass of collected data” and, therefore, data is considered to\nbe a carrier of information that must be interpreted (Ghauri, 2004). It could be argued that\n\nqualitative research primarily emphasised data collection methods and paid less attention to data\nanalysis techniques applied (Miles & Huberman, 1994; Lindsay, 2004; Zalan & Lewis, 2004).\nFor instance, Eisenhardt (1989b) noted that despite the crucial role of data analysis for theory\nbuilding in the case study method, many qualitative studies outline their methodology too briefly\n(Zalan & Lewis, 2004) and largely ignore discussing their analytical procedure. Eisenhardt and\n\nGraebner (2007) further proposed that researchers should follow a systematic process of data\ncollection and describe the development of their conceptual arguments in a transparent and easily\ncomprehensible way. This section, therefore, adheres to a systematic and transparent review of\nthe data analysis process, outlines the comprehensive data analysis procedure undertaken and the\nassociated analytical techniques applied in this study.\nThe data analysis procedure “dissects, reduces, sorts and reconstitutes data” (Ghauri &\nGrønhaug, 2010: 199). There is no widely agreed understanding in qualitative studies on how the\ndata should be analysed. However, Miles and Huberman (1994) provided useful steps to structure\nthe collected qualitative data using the processes of data reduction, data display, conclusion\n\ndrawing and data verification. These steps of analysis were adopted in this study and used as a\nbroad framework for all stages of data collection and analysis. In this process, Miles and\nHuberman (1994) emphasised that data is transformed because it is reduced and condensed in a\nmanner that allows to cluster and sort data and enables the researcher to understand data in relation\nto the questions of “what”, “when” and “how”. Miles and Huberman (2004) suggested analysing\n\ndata alongside the data collection process, and Ghauri and Grønhaug (2010) further cautioned\nthat a separate data analysis procedure could weaken both the analysis and the data. This approach\nallows the researcher to identify themes and trends, which could be incorporated in the following\nstages of the data collection (i.e. redefined questions) and is said to enhance the overall data\ncollection process. Simultaneous data collection and analysis proved particularly valuable in this\ncase study and allowed me to save time, as well as to identify problems or themes before\nconducting further interviews or observations.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n119\n\n4.4.1 Data collection stream\nAs reviewed earlier in this chapter, this study used the case study design. The techniques\nfor collecting data were primarily interviews conducted with the GABV banks’ board directors\nand the Secretariat members, participant observations during two GABV Board Forum meetings\n\nand analysis of supporting documents, which allowed for data triangulation. Within the applied\ntechnique, data collection is the first stage of the research process closely linked to research\nquestions and data analysis process (Ghauri, 2004).\nThe sample of interviewees was developed by relying on a theoretical sampling\ntechnique, continually narrowing the sample of possible actors in the field based on the theoretical\n\ntrends that the researcher observed emerging from the data. The study began by a visit to the\nGABV Governing Board Forum meeting in 2015. At the meeting, the researcher was introduced\nto representatives from the GABV member banks and started preparing a list of relevant study\nparticipants. Representatives from the GABV Secretariat provided the researcher with further\ncontacts to people, who they believed were most salient to my research questions. To further\novercome access challenges within the sustainable banking community, a snowball approach was\nfollowed, with the researcher asking respondents to suggest other colleagues or stakeholders she\nshould speak to, whom they believed to possess impactful stories on sustainable finance. It was\nfound that the GABV members were more willing to participate in the research if they knew that\n\nothers had also agreed to do so, thereby making the snowball approach the most appropriate way\nto gain access to this community of practice.\nData collection began with the first part of study dedicated to understanding how\nsustainable banks perceive their own identities and whether the plurality of sustainable identity\ncould be noted. A qualitative questions guide “Capturing the Essence of Governance”, which\n\nconsisted of six structured written questions, was developed and distributed to contact persons in\nthe GABV member organisations. The purpose of this part of the study was to develop a\npreliminary understanding of the challenges brought up by the simultaneous pursuit of the\ncommunity development and the financial profitability goals. Additional goal was to test the\ninterest in the study among the GABV member banks. This part of the study was performed with\nthe help from the GABV Secretariat, who took an active role in promoting the study among the\nbanks’ board directors, communicating with the participants and linking me to interested parties.\nResponses from twelve banks were received, qualitatively analysed and combined with other\nprimary and secondary data to identify that simultaneous pursuit of dual goals creates challenges\n\nfor sustainable banks, which could be theorised as liabilities for multiple goals and liabilities to\nmultiple stakeholders. Based on the previous research, a structured written questions method was\n120\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nadopted for this part of the study as time-efficient, reliable and informing for follow-up interviews\nand observations.\nTo collect specific data related to the organisational identity orientation of sustainable\nbanks, Brickson’s (2015, 2017) approach was followed and four qualitative measure developed\nby the researcher were adopted. Questions related to these measures were included in the\n\ninterviews with board directors in no special order and constituted a natural part of the discussion,\nhowever, were later separately analysed to reveal insights on the organisational identity\norientation of the GABV banks. Using the “Ten Statements Test”, the researcher asked\ninterviewees to complete the sentence stem “My organisation is...” ten times in any way they\npreferred and in the order that occurred to them. The method is derived from Kuhn &\nMcPortland’s (1954) empirical investigation of self-attitudes, where they applied a twenty\nstatements test. Brickson (2015) further suggested shortening the measure to ten items for the\nstudies of organisations, providing evidence that ten responses generated sufficient information\nfor revealing the organisational identity orientation and were substantially less onerous for\n\nresearch participants. Based on the success of her study, the ten statements approach was adopted\nto use in the interviews for this research.\nThree further qualitative measures of the organisational identity orientation consisted of\nshort open questions with possible follow-up discussions. The “Troubling Event” question is\nderived from Gabriel & Gardner’s (1999) study on independent, relational and collective\n\nemotional experiences. Following Brickson’s (2015) adaptation of this method, the researcher\nspecifically asked her interviewees to describe not just an emotional event, but an actual or\nhypothetical event that had been or would be troubling to their organisation. Research participants\nwere further asked to explain which aspects of the event they considered troubling and why. The\nmethod rests on the premise that an organisational identity determines which events and issues\norganisational members would consider threatening to the existing identity (Dutton & Dukerich,\n1991). Descriptions given by the interviewees were later classified as independent, relational or\ncollective based on the type of event or its aspects that triggered the emotional response.\nUsing the “Organisation as Person” question, the researcher asked research participants\n\nto describe their organisation as if it was a person. The method is based on the premise that “the\norganisation assumes an anthropomorphic identity in the eyes of the employees” (Morrison &\nRobinson, 1997: 228). It was previously applied to the organisational studies by Brickson (2015)\nto prove the validity of the organisational identity orientation as a concept and has proved its\nusefulness. Finally, the “Accurate Motto” question was applied to collect data about what the\n\nGABV banks’ members believe would be the motto that most accurately describes their\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n121\n\norganisation and its values. The measure was used to receive more accurate descriptions of “who\nwe are as an organisation” (Albert & Whetten, 1985), as perceived by its members. The questions\nused during the interviews to capture the organisational identity orientation are summarised in\nTable 5.\n\nTABLE 5.

This\nprocess is also sometimes referred to as “data condensation” (Tesch, 1990) and involves a number\nof steps. According to Miles and Huberman (1994: 10-11), the process is aimed at facilitating\ndata analysis as it allowed the researcher to choose “which data chunks to code and which to pull\nout, which paths best summarise a number of chunks, which evolving stories to tell.” This stage\nof data analysis has to be done carefully, transparently and systematically to allow the researcher\nto go back and forth within the data and apply new codes.\nThe first step of data reduction in this research focused on transcribing the recorded\ninterviews, as suggested by Bell and Bryman (2007). After completing the transcription of all\n\ninterviews in Spanish, those were translated into English and some cases were further back\ntranslated to ensure no distortion of the data, as advised by Bell and Bryman (2007). The English\n122\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\ntranscripts were then included in the case database, as suggested by Yin (2009). The case notes\nof all participant banks, which were not recorded, were systematically written up post interviews\nand then likewise added to the case database. Interview data was supplemented by participant\nobservation notes and documents analysed. The advantage of the time-consuming process of\nconducting, transcribing and translating interviews is that it allows the researcher to become very\n\nfamiliar with the case study. This familiarisation was enhanced by reading the transcripts and\ntaking associated notes, which promoted data reflection and preliminary conceptualisation.\nThroughout this process, the researcher was enabled to reflect on the emerging preliminary\nobservations, thoughts and concepts (Easterby-Smith, Thorpe & Lowe, 2002).\nThe large amount of data was then manually coded. According to Ghauri and Gronhaug\n(2010: 200), “codes serve as shorthand devices to label, separate, compile and organise data.”\nInterview transcripts, observation notes and supporting documents were systematically coded for\ncertain lines, paragraphs, words and points relating to the research question. The researcher\nsearched for trends, themes and causal relationships in the data, and early findings were\n\ncontinuously noted down (Miles & Huberman, 1994). Given the limited understanding of\npluralistic organisational identity and the relatively low number of empirical researches in this\narea of knowledge (Patvardhan et al., 2015), an inductive approach to data analysis was used. As\ndata collection continued, the researcher travelled back and forth between the data, the literature\nand the emerging themes (Miles & Huberman, 1994), focusing on pluralistic organisational\n\nidentity within the GABV, its content and behaviours. Data was thus collected and simultaneously\nanalysed until the “theoretical saturation” (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) had been reached. The\nresearch project progressed through three main stages of data analysis.\nAt the first stage of data analysis, the researcher engaged in open coding with codes\nascribed from the observed phenomena (Harrison & Leitch, 2014). Interview transcripts,\nobservation notes, document accounts and archival materials collected from the GABV were then\ncompiled into a comprehensive summary sheet. Using NVivo software, the data was then coded\nfor all instances where the community development and the commercial logics were mentioned\nin relation to the GABV identity. Beyond these predetermined directions, the researcher allowed\n\ncodes to emerge from the data, so the relationships and possibilities could be explored. Provisional\nfirst-order codes were then organised into broader emerging themes. During this step, the\nresearcher evaluated which categories came together to form theoretical themes. Data collection\ncontinued until no new codes emerged and then merged codes that addressed similar phenomena.\nThe researcher then moved from analysing specific data to developing more abstract and\n\ntheoretical concepts.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n123\n\nFirst, data related to banks’ perception of identity plurality and associated challenges was\nanalysed supplemented by extensive document analysis. The researcher qualitatively coded the\ndata to reveal challenges faced by sustainable banks in simultaneously pursuing the ethical and\nthe economic goals. Table 6 displays the categories of liabilities that have been observed in the\ndata and developed into aggregated theoretical categories in an iterative process of moving\n\nbetween the data and the existing literature.\n\nTABLE 6. DATA STRUCTURE: LIABILITIES OF ORGANISATIONAL\nIDENTITY PLURALITY\nFirst Order Categories\n\nTheoretical\nCategories\n\nThe GABV banks faced regulatory\nchallenges, as they did not fit into any\nestablished business form categories and\nstrived to innovate continuously to deliver\nstronger profitability and faster community\ndevelopment\n\nLiabilities of\nstructure\n\nThe GABV banks worked to ensure broad\nrepresentation of stakeholders at their boards\nand ensuring high professionalism of their\nboard committees at the same time\n\nLiabilities of\ngovernance\n\nThe GABV banks faced challenges in\nattracting the best talent and making sure their\nco-workers possess the desirable expertise and\nfinance and share the community development\napproach essential to the organisation\n\nLiabilities to coworkers\n\nThe GABV banks worked to address the\nneeds of diverse stakeholders and community\nmembers, which required innovative\ncommunication, representation and\ncommunity involvement techniques\n\nLiabilities to\ncommunities\n\nThe GABV banks emphasised the importance\nof thorough assessment of their project, which\nneed to be financially viable and create\ntangible community benefit to satisfy their\nscreening criteria\n\nLiabilities of\nactivities\n\nAggregate Theoretical\nDimensions\n\nLiabilities for multiple\ngoals\n\nLiabilities to multiple\nprinciple stakeholders\n\nSource: Author (2019)\n\n124\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThe next step involved uncovering the relationships between and among categories,\nwhich would then allow their grouping into higher-order themes (Locke, 2001). The goal of this\nstep was to settle on the theoretical concepts, variables and relationships that advanced the model\nof pluralistic organisational identity. At this stage, the researcher decided on which themes were\nthe most significant to the broader conceptual framework. Having identified main liabilities of\n\nthe organisational identity plurality, the analysis moved to exploring how the GABV banks\nmanage these liabilities to avoid a mission drift. Throughout this iterative process, the researcher\ncontinually shared her emerging findings with respondents in order to seek confirmation and\nclarification of data and to get reactions to the more general frames.\nIn the analysis of the GABV banks’ liabilities for multiple goals the researcher engaged\nin open coding to look for identity work tactics employed by sustainable banks to resolve tensions\nbetween the community development and the banking goals. At this stage, the analysis drew on\nresearch on pluralistic organisational identities, which informed the process but could not\nsatisfactorily explain the data. Then more abstract and theoretical informed dimensions from the\n\nfirst-order themes were developed. This iterative process resulted in eight theoretical categories\nmarking specific identity work practices. Table 7 represents the identity work tactics discovered\nthrough the qualitative coding process and the aggregated themes generated after linking the\nfindings to the broader research context.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n125\n\nTABLE 7.

The researcher began by familiarising herself with the types of\nstakeholder orientations identified by the existing literature, their features and ways of\nidentification. The first codebook summarised in Table 8 was based on Brickson (2005; 2007)\nand O’Higgins (2009) and adapted for the research questions. The researcher went through her\ndata several times to get a sense for the kinds of statements that were made by research\n\nparticipants. Statements setting the organisation apart from others and emphasising a focus on\n\n126\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nmaximising the organisational welfare were coded as individualistic. Examples included\n“ambitious”, “profit-oriented” and “leader”. Statements stressing the organisational focus on\ncreating partnerships and building strong links with particular stakeholders, as well as on\nenhancing the welfare of these selected partners were coded as relational. Examples included\n“caring”, “reliable”, “community-embedded” and “promoting a cause”. Statements portraying\n\norganisation as part of the larger whole and indicating its concern for enhancing the welfare of a\nlarger collective were coded as collectivistic. Examples included “providing a public service”,\n“politically active” and “supporting sustainable development”.\nTABLE 8.

Patient.”\n“We grow together with our community\nmembers”\n“We find solutions for the micro and small\nbusiness sector”\n\nSource: Author (2019)\n\nAfter identifying the relational nature of the organisational identity orientation expressed\nby the GABV banks, the study progressed to exploring how it helps them reconcile liabilities\ntowards multiple stakeholder groups. The researcher further coded the data for specific practices\nthat the relational identity orientation involves. To the researcher’s knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to talk about the specific practices that constitute the relational identity orientation, and no\nprevious coding guides had been established for such analysis. Therefore, this final stage of data\nanalysis again relied on open coding and allowed categories to emerge from the data.\nFinally, the process moved from analysing specific data to developing more abstract and\ntheoretical concepts. The goal of this step was to settle on the theoretical concepts, variables, and\n\n128\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nrelationships that determined the approach of sustainable banks to managing their liabilities for\nmultiple goals and liabilities to multiple stakeholders. In this stage, the researcher decided on\nwhich themes related to each other and were most significant to my conceptual framework. It was\nfinalised, which codes were used and re-examined the data’s fit with the codebook and the\nemerging theoretical constructions. Finally, tables and summary sheets were created to\nsummarise findings for each set of liabilities.\n\n4.4.3 Data presentation and discussion stream\nAccording to Miles and Huberman (1994: 11), the data presentation stream refers to “an\norganised, compressed assembly of information that permits conclusion drawing and action.”\nData can be presented in various forms to make it accessible in a compact manner, which is not\nindependent from the analysis. This study primarily used in-text data displays, such as quotes, but\nalso used tables as visual data displays. The data presentation allows the researcher to compress\nand capture complex data (Lindsay, 2004). Rich qualitative data in this study was illustrated with\nrelevant key quotes according to each research question within the text or summarised in a table,\nwhere appropriate.\nConclusions drawn from a study should always be verified and this was undertaken in\nthe Discussion chapter, as the researcher returned to the raw data collected and crosschecked that\nit had been captured correctly. Conclusions drawn were further verified by using a deductive\napproach to link findings and observations back to the existing literature, which Eisenhardt\n(1989b: 544) recommended as an important step to “identify what is similar, contradictory and\nwhy this is the case.” Furthermore, it is important to provide a logical trail explaining how the\nresearcher reached the final framework (Yin, 2009) and discuss how the conclusions can be linked\nback to theory (Lindsay, 2004). The conclusions were further verified through meetings with\nresearch supervisors and colleagues. The data collected was presented at research seminars,\nconferences and end of the academic year panels, which tested plausibility and conformability of\nthe study (Miles & Huberman, 1994).\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n129\n\n4.5 Research credibility\n4.5.1 Research credibility\nYin (2009: 32) suggested that the quality of the research design could be evaluated based\non its “trustworthiness, credibility, confirmability and data dependability.” To ensure the presence\nof these concepts, four validity tests have been commonly used in the social science research:\nConstruct validity: transforms conceptual frameworks into practical applications and\ndetermines operational measures for the phenomenon being studied (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005;\nGibbert et al., 2008; Yin, 2009);\n\nInternal validity: establishes causal relationships and provides the basis for evaluating\nspecific connections or associations between causes and effects (Kidder & Judd, 1986;\nEisenhardt, 1989b; Gibbert et al., 2008; Yin, 2009);\nExternal validity: represents the degree to which findings from the research can be\ngeneralised (Eisenhardt, 1989b; Gibbert et al., 2008; Yin, 2009);\n\nReliability: refers to the consistency of measure and ensures that operations of the study\ncan be repeated with similar results (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005; Gibbert et al., 2008; Yin, 2009).\nGibbert et al. (2008) emphasised that four types of validity outlined above are not\nindependent and could only ensure research credibility when applied together. Yin (2009: 38)\nadded that not all of the tests could be conducted at the formal stage of designing a case study,\nand some will “occur during the data collection, data analysis, or compositional phases of the\nresearch.” Yin’s (2009) methodology was followed and construct validity, internal validity,\nexternal validity and reliability tests were applied to this study of the GABV to ensure its\ncredibility. Details of the validity tests are summarised in Table 10 to allow for comprehensive\n\nassessment of the quality of the research conducted.\n\n130\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nTABLE 10.

This study adhered to the code of ethical\nguidelines formulated by the University of Edinburgh and the Economic Social Research Council\n\n(ESRC) to ensure that the study was conducted in an ethical manner and all prescribed procedures\nhave been followed. All research participants were thoroughly informed about the purpose,\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n131\n\nobjectives and scale of this research. Their right to withdraw from the research at any time has\nbeen clearly stated. Research participants from the GABV were assured that the information they\nprovided will be used exclusively for the stated research purposes. The researcher did not sign\nany consent forms and the ethical protocol was followed verbally. The researcher relied on her\nown judgment on any ethical issues (Wright, 2004) based on her understanding of corporate\n\nculture in the banking field and cultures of the countries represented by research participants.\nResearch participants did not request to remain anonymous in the study, nevertheless,\nfindings have been generalised so neither the participants nor regional chapters could be identified\n(McGaughey, 2004). Therefore, Bell and Bryman’s (2007) unethical behaviour categories were\navoided, which include harming the participant, lack of informed consent, invasion of privacy\nand deception. Furthermore, the researcher analysed data keeping in mind the goal of avoiding\nmisstatements, misinterpretations or fraudulent analysis (Lichtman, 2013). Even though\nqualitative research is inevitably construed to its conceptual framework, epistemological\ncommitments, personal characteristics and preconceptions of the researcher, a comprehensive set\n\nof validity tests has been applied to ensure proper credibility of findings and protect research\nparticipants from misrepresentation (Richards & Schwartz, 2002).\n\n4.5.3 Research limitations\nA robust research methodology should always acknowledge possible limitations of the\nchosen approach. The qualitative research design of this study was appropriate for the research\nobjectives. However, findings could be further tested to verify these in other pluralistic identity\norganisations within the sustainable banking sector and in other field contexts. Further, this study\nemployed semi-structured interviews and participant observations, and there is always a danger\n\nthat the data collected has not been exploited to its full extent. Although the study of the GABV\nallows for multiple replications, the researcher is aware that the findings are not representative\nacross all sustainable finance institutions, as they were also chosen by purposeful sampling. Yin\n(1994) also recommended to use case study protocols and develop case study databases to\nincrease the reliability of the methodology. As the GABV produced an extensive data set, it was\n\nimportant to keep a balance between depth and breadth. Several measures have been taken to\naddress the known limitations of the qualitative case study research design.\nOrganisational identity theory does not prescribe any specific research methodology. It\nis not associated with any standard research design or even a set of methods (Tolbert et al., 1996).\nEmpirical studies within multiple identities and hybrid identity perspectives have relied on a\nvariety of techniques, including single and multiple case studies, ethnography, grounded theory,\n\n132\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\netc. Methodological choices of this study include qualitative approach and case study method.\nThese choices were motivated by the theoretical framework and the research questions which ask\nfor the organisational level of analysis and in-depth exploratory approach. Qualitative approaches\nto studies on sustainable finance and banking organisations have been scarce until now, while a\ndominant body of research focused on the causal relationship of variables related to the financial\n\nand the ethical performance indicators. Despite a general trend for quantitative research on\nsustainable finance and banking, for the purpose of this thesis qualitative methodology was found\nmore suitable due to the nature of the research questions and the theoretical orientation of the\nstudy. They emphasise the importance of understanding how, in what way sustainable banks\nexperience the identity plurality and they resolve the associated challenges and liabilities. An\nimportant characteristic of qualitative approach is its ability to provide a deep understanding of\nsocial phenomena, which quantitative research does not allow.\nOne of the limitations of this research was its time-consuming nature presented by the\ncase study method. The number of analysed banks within the GABV was limited to twelve for\n\nmultiple reasons, including the need to gain access and make data collection arrangements, the\ndifficulty of collecting information in different countries and languages and the issues associated\nwith coding and analysing large samples of qualitative data. This limitation was partly offset by\nconducting participant observations during two Governing Board Forum meetings, where a large\nnumber of member-banks were present and analysing a large number of documents covering all\n\nGABV member organisations. The role of participant-observer allowed the researcher to access\nimportant information within the Alliance, contact multiple actors within the GABV and its\nmember banks, access networks in the sustainable finance and banking field. It helps to get into\ncontact with other organisations.\nIt has been argued that data produced by qualitative studies is difficult to observe and\nverify. Therefore, the first problem associated with qualitative research is reliability described as\na degree of consistency in the way items are assigned to same categories by different researchers\nor by the same researcher on different occasions. The second challenge is validity, which occurs\nwhen short quotes from unstructured interviews are used to provide evidence for research\n\narguments (Silverman, 1993). In an attempt to minimise these problems, the researcher devoted\nattention to objectivity and rigour throughout data collection and data analysis. The measures\nundertook in this study to ensure its credibility and validity have been discussed in detail in section\n4.5.1 of the present chapter. In order to recede the limitations of each individual data source and\nencourage “convergent lines of inquiry” (Yin, 2009), three data sources were used in combination.\n\nMultiple sources of evidence allow for multiple measures of the phenomenon, therefore, reducing\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n133\n\nthe problem of construct validity and ensuring greater accuracy of findings. An additional tactic\nused to attend to these research design limitations was the construction of a chain of evidence,\nwhich allows an external observer to “follow the derivation of any evidence from initial research\nquestions to ultimate case study conclusion” (Yin, 1004). This chapter provides a detailed account\nof the data collection process, including times and places of interviews and observations. Even\n\nthough the names of the people interviewed stay anonymous, data quotes used as evidence are\ndisclosed in the thesis with a clear mention of the source. Another tactic used to overcome the\nconstruct validity problem was discussion and cross-checking of early findings and final\nconclusions with research participants from the GABV.\nIn addition, the case study methodology has been criticised for external validity issues,\nsuch as limited basis for generalising of findings. Yin (1994) proposed that case studies could be\ngeneralised to theoretical propositions rather than populations or universes. In this study several\nmeasures have been undertaken to address the limitation. In additions to the research data from\nthe GABV banks, the researcher analysed wider range of field documents and conducted informal\n\ndiscussions with other sustainable banks outside the GABV (such as Charity Bank from the UK).\nThis data was not included in the case study; however it enabled to crosscheck and complete the\nin-depth case study. Moreover, the research was not bound to any national or institutional context\nwhich would have limited generalisation at an international level.\nCertain research design limitations could also be associated with specific data collection\n\nand analysis technique employed for this study. Thus, the participant-as-observer role involved\nsituations where the researcher took part in the GABV meetings and observed, while at the same\ntime building relationships with research participants. The researcher made known to the GABV\nmembers that she was doing an investigation, which provided her with freedom to focus on\nmeetings and discussions that were relevant to the study (Burgess, 1984). Burgess (1984) further\nsuggested that certain characteristics of the research could have significance for conducting\nparticipant observations, namely professional experience, age, gender and ethnicity. In the case\nof this thesis, the experience variable was covered through involvement within the sustainable\nfinance and banking field prior to PhD studies. The researcher worked as an analyst for an\n\ninternational investment firm focusing on ESG research and investment. The researcher,\ntherefore, possessed valuable experience within the field before engaging in the current study.\nThe other variables were not of specific relevance for this research.\nBurgess (1984) pointed to another limitation of participant observations related to the\nrelationship of the researcher with the research participants. He proposed that researchers should\n\nclosely monitor the differences between themselves and the participants of their study. Participant\n\n134\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nobservers become part of the context that they observe and get involved in face-to-face\ninteractions with research participants, which might impact the process of the data collection and\nthe final data sample. As a result, researchers might influence the research context or be\ninfluenced by it. Assuming that entirely avoiding researcher’s influence on the subject is an\nidealistic improbability (Denzin, 1978), several measures were employed in this study to\n\neliminate such limitations. Firstly, the natural non-directional type of researcher’s interactions\nwith research participants during observations makes this method the least intrusive of all research\ntechniques (Denzin, 1978). Moreover, the researcher undertook extensive training in qualitative\nresearch methods and was aware that what she observes depends largely on her own positioning\nin the network of relationships (Vidich, 1969). In order to minimise this limitation, the position\nof the researcher and her limited participation in the meetings were clearly discussed and agreed\nin advance. Yin (1994) further proposed that the major limitation of qualitative research is\nassociated with the potential bias produced. The researcher encountered the risk of following a\ncommonly known phenomenon and become supporter of the organisation being studied. In order\n\nto minimise such risks, the involvement with the GABV was limited to two most important annual\nmeetings. On other instances of interaction with research participants the researcher performed\nher primary role without simultaneously being a participant.\n\n4.6 Chapter Summary\nOverall, this chapter presented the purpose, research design and methodology of this\nstudy, supported by the research philosophy and approach. The adopted case study research\ndesign and the associated data collection tools of interviews, participant observations and\ndocument analysis were outlined. Further the role of the researcher in the process was discussed\nand efforts undertook to eliminate the bias in this qualitative study were outlined. Moreover, the\nframework and the applied methods of data analysis, briefly summarised in Table 11, were\nexplained. Furthermore, the chapter presented a discussion on research credibility, the associated\nethical issues and the existing research limitations. The three subsequent chapters will present the\nfindings of this empirical investigation. Thus, Chapter 5 will discuss how sustainable banks\nexperience identity plurality, and which associated challenges they face. Chapters 6 and 7 will\nfocus on the ways sustainable banks resolve the challenges and liabilities of identity plurality.\nSpecifically, Chapter 6 will summarise insights on the approach the GABV banks take to address\ntheir liabilities for multiple goals, whereas Chapter 7 will cover the measures taken to resolve the\nbanks’ liabilities to multiple stakeholder groups.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n135\n\nTABLE 11.

As it was discussed in the previous chapter, sustainable banks combine the economic and\nthe ethical roles, which imply different and oftentimes competing performance goals. Previous\nresearch reported that tensions and incompatibilities among these contradicting goals might lead\nto one organisational role gaining dominance over the other (Selznick, 1949). In particular, the\norganisational theory has a long tradition of highlighting the risk of firms losing sight of their\nethical purpose in the quest for financial profitability and organisational efficiency (Selznick,\n1949; Weber, 1952). Therefore, in an attempt to simultaneously deliver capital gains and\ncommunity benefits, sustainable banks face an increased risk of a mission drift (Jones, 2007;\nWeisbrod, 2004).\nThis chapter explores the approach sustainable banks take to combining the ethical and\nthe economic roles in society and answers to what extent these organisations experience the\nidentity plurality. It further discusses the tensions faced by sustainable banks in combining their\neconomic and ethical roles. In addition, the chapter provides detailed account of the GABV\nbanks’ perception of their identity plurality and thoroughly discusses the discovered challenges\nof banking on values. Below, four major challenges of identity plurality experienced by the\nGABV banks are discussed, namely regulatory, governance, stakeholder relations and project\nassessment.\n\n5.2 Identity Plurality within Sustainable Banks\nThe GABV base their work on values that exceed the commercial purpose and are\ngrouped around social and environmental dimensions. Their banking model incorporates\neconomic, social and environmental values, as well as ethical values in management, which these\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\n137\n\nfirms believe to generate better financial returns and improve the overall financial performance.\nThis study revealed that the GABV banks share the following knowledge, attitude and behaviour\nregarding their organisational goals and role in the community:\n“We strongly believe that a diverse banking system can serve our communities\nbetter. More smaller banks in this regard sound more attractive than a small number\nof large ones ... A crucial part of our banking philosophy is trust. Trust was damaged\nafter the recent financial crisis and the facts it revealed about the global banking\nsystem. Now we work to restore trust ... We want to be transparent about our\nbusiness model and our lending, so stakeholders know how we use their money ...\nand how we make or lose money. We strongly believe that our service to community\nis fundamental to our responsibilities as a bank. We believe in addressing systemic\nforces – including environmental and social consequences – and focus on the longterm picture ... This is the only that banking can be healthy.”\nOrganisational identity is a key point to define the values from which a company builds\nmeanings and relationships with its stakeholders (Freeman, 1984). Sustainable banks referred to\nthe following elements that unify their organisations and provide reference to their stakeholders:\n“The community focus approach gives money a moral compass so to say. When\nguided by strong ethical believes, banking becomes a powerful instrument to care\nfor and protect the people and the planet ... For us, the focus on financial gains alone\nis short-sighted and inadequate ... We cannot achieve our goals of building more\nsustainable communities by the sole focus on the financial side. We deliberately\nchoose to look after ‘people, planet and profit’ ... and measure profit according to\nthe ‘triple bottom-line’.”\nTherefore, data analysis revealed that the GABV banks perceive themselves as simultaneously\nthe economic and the ethical actors. It further demonstrated that such organisational identity\nplurality underlines these banks’ choices regarding strategic, organisational, and operational\nissues. A GABV member from the U.S. commented:\n“We usually say that our bank doesn’t have a mission. We’re on a mission to make\nthe industry more fair, compassionate and sustainable for our co-workers, families,\ncommunities and planet ... We work to support those who cares to support others.\nWe invest in progressive and impactful initiative within our community ... and we\nseek financial opportunity for all people here ... We actively promote responsible\nbanking and responsible investing, which benefits the community, not harms it ...\nWe work with labour unions, charity organisations, social enterprises, political\nfoundations and individuals. We offer services and support to all of them ... If I had\nto say what our organisation stands for that would be ‘doing the most good for the\nmost people’.”\nThe economic and the community development goals within the GABV banks both serve to\nmotivate and focus board directors and co-workers. A GABV bank from the U.S. explained how\nthey perceive their organisational role:\n\n138\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\n“We aim to create positive impact for community through all our operations ... it\nconcerns both how we make money and how we invest it. We have commitment to\nfinding new, alternative, better ways to approach banking ... and to create impact.\nThis way of doing business differentiates us from traditional financial institutions ...\nand the whole profit centred philosophy behind it ... We measure our success in\nterms of health of the community as a whole ... Our organisational values cover\nmore than profits. It is always profit for community.”\nAnother GABV member from Switzerland expanded:\n“We represent and support businesses and organisations that align with our values\nand vision ... We are happy to see our community growing. Our organisation is\ncommitted to making positive impact ... we seek opportunity to work with\norganisations that are also taking significant steps to improve their social, ethical and\nenvironmental performance.”\nEthics related goals are concerned with the work of every co-worker within sustainable banks:\n“We create an environment that is inclusive, encouraging and rewarding. We\nrespect our responsibilities to families, friends and communities that trust us ... Our\nbank leads by example and leverages its resources and expertise to bring positive\nchange to the community ... We invest responsibly in the communities where we\nlive and work. We have experience now ... and we apply our unique skills and\nexpertise to create solutions to social, environmental and economic challenges. We\nadvocate socially and environmentally responsible banking ... We partner with the\norganisations that implement ethical employee relations practices, contribute to\nprosperity of their communities and respect environmental development goals ... We\nteach our members leadership and give them resources and opportunities to do their\nbest and achieve their full potential.”\nSimilarly, board directors of the GABV banks explicitly focus on both sets of goals. In addition\nto functions around the financial and management oversight, they work to ensure ethics and\nvalues integrity and support for community development goals. A GABV member from the UK\n\nshared:\n“We are the bank that measures social impact to evaluate organisations, who want\nto work with us ... to evaluate our own progress for good. We want to see how we\nare helping organisations succeed and grow ... We combine profit and impact in\neverything we do for the community. We are a bank with strong ethics and values.\nThat’s what our members trust us for.”\nAnother GABV member further elaborated on the themes that unite sustainable banks:\n“I’m often asked which principles should be embedded in the culture of ethical\nbanks. We place social impact at the core of our banking philosophy. It is not simply\nthe emphasis on social impact, he goes much further ... The ‘triple bottom-line’ is\nfundamental for our business model. Our banking is grounded in communities ... it\nis serving the real economy. We work to enable organisations and individuals to meet\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\n139\n\nthe needs of both the economy and the community ... We work hard to achieve direct\nunderstanding of economic activities of our customers and the risks involved. We\nplan for long-term ... we want to be self-sustaining and resilient to outside\ndisruptions ... Our banking is transparent and inclusive.”\nFindings from this study further make explicit that the core mission of sustainable banks goes\nbeyond generating profit and focuses on various community development goals. A GABV\nmember from Canada commented:\n“Our vision requires us to think differently about wealth. We measure success in\nterms of how we contribute to the well-being of our members ... this includes not\njust financial well-being, but social and environmental well-being as well ... We as\norganisation believe that we can only achieve prosperity if we are surrounded by and\nconnected to a healthy community that is resilient in the long run. Traditional\nbanking focuses on short-term profits for the benefit of shareholders ... our vision is\nto meet the long-term needs of our members and their communities.”\nA GABV bank from Ukraine further added:\n“This is a unique case for Ukraine. We focus on the services which are the most\nimportant to people and companies we are working with ... We learned from a wide\nrange of stakeholders here and abroad. We aim to ensure stability, quality of service\nand help customers to realise their financial goals and dreams ... We aspire to\nbecome a leading client-focused bank, which guarantees financial stability. It is\nmuch needed in local communities ... We want our work to benefit clients,\nshareholders and employees.”\n\nTherefore, it could be concluded that sustainable banks simultaneously focus on profit and\ncommunity development. These organisations perceive themselves as having dual goals that are\nequally important for fulfilling their organisational mission and vision. Based on these findings,\nthe GABV banks could be described as pluralistic identity organisations that simultaneously\npursue the economic and the ethical goals. The following sections will focus on the challenges\nsuch identity plurality creates within the GABV banks and the ways these firms address them in\norder to fulfil their liabilities for multiple goals and liabilities to multiple stakeholders.\n\n5.3 Regulatory Challenges\nExisting literature discussed in great detail the importance of the organisational form\nchoice for pluralistic identity organisations, and its implications for organisational legitimacy,\nappeal to different audiences and ability to secure resources. Such organisations represent a\nreflexive effort to borrow from the already established models of organising, as well as the new\nones, therefore linking innovation with tradition. Sustainable banks build on the legitimacy of the\nestablished organisational forms, such as a commercial bank or a credit union, and take advantage\n\n140\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\nof the previously institutionalised resource flows, while incorporating innovations in organising\nmethods, such as highly representative boards (Minkoff, 2002). By fusing the long-established\nlegitimate models with the more recently constructed one, sustainable banks experience both\npositive and negative externalities from the resource procurement and legitimacy-building efforts\nof other market participants. One of the GABV banks commented on the shared understanding\nwithin the sector that banks should work together with regulators to promote positive change:\n“There is growing recognition of the role of financial regulators and central banks\nwithin the financial system to mitigate risks from climate-related and social factors.”\nOne of the main choices of a sustainable bank is the one between a commercial bank\nstructure and a not-for-profit credit union model, which will predetermine their strategy of capital\nattraction, restrictions on member attraction and the set of regulatory requirements they will have\nto comply with. One of the GABV banks shared:\n“It is not likely that there could be one authority that would anticipate with the\nnecessary accuracy all influences and outcomes of the processes in the financial\nsystem. The system has many issues that affect our work directly and indirectly.”\nAs non-profits, credit unions usually can offer higher interest rates on savings accounts\nand lower interest rates on loans and credit cards. Most credit unions are cooperative\norganisations owned and operated by their members, which helps overcome some agencyprincipal problems faced by the conventional banks. At the same time, this legal form imposes\nrestrictions on their membership criteria. For instance, one of the GABV credit cooperatives from\nCanada only operates within the province of British Columbia and cannot plan direct\ngeographical expansion based on its current regime of incorporation. Another GABV institution\ncommented on the associated regulatory challenges:\n“Regulation should start from an understanding of what is needed for the real\neconomy and what is not. It should control risks, ... penalise misuse and reward good\nbehaviour that improves the common good ... Regulation must encourage diversity,\nnot restrain it.”\nNevertheless, ongoing discussions of the importance of support for socially responsible\norganisations from local governments have not yet resulted into substantially improved or adapted\nlegislation for sustainable banks. One of the GABV members noted:\n“We need a more holistic view of the economy, society and environment that will\npredicate financial resilience. Regulatory instruments used to ensure this should be\nrecalibrated, ... in particular capital requirements.”\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\n141\n\nThe data shows that the GABV banks often struggle to meet regulatory requirements and\nare concerned that the “one size fits all” approach of financial regulators might force them to\ncompromise their mission and values. For example, sustainable banks registered as credit unions\nare, by definition, owned by their members and governed by the democratically elected boards of\ndirectors. Nevertheless, local governments in some provinces of Canada expressed concerns\nabout operational standards of such representative boards. They have been holding continuous\ndiscussions about prescribing these financial institutions in a regulatory manner to switch to\nprofessional boards. In their attempts to raise professional standards of the financial industry, the\ngovernment is challenging sustainable banks that are not ready for this move, because their\ngovernance models rely greatly on community involvement and member participation. Moreover,\nin many countries the amount of regulation in the financial sector is disproportionate to the risk\nprofiles of sustainable banks, which was pointed out by a GABV bank from the UK:\n“The cost of regulation falls disproportionately high on smaller banks like ours.\nDespite so many years of successful lending to charities, we still have to provide\n100% risk weighting to loans ... Other loans, like the ones for property, where\nvaluations can be so volatile, are not regulated that strictly.”\nThis study also found that the GABV banks experience challenges in areas of\ntransparency and accountability, which are loosely regulated and lack clear frameworks for\naccounts of factors other than financial results. Sustainable banks generally adhere to high\nstandards of information transparency to decrease the information asymmetry of banking\ntransactions. It refers to the access of stakeholders to information about organisational past,\ncurrent and planned activities. It also reflects whether the information presented is balanced rather\nthan biased (Basu & Palazzo, 2008). One of the GABV members commented on the challenges\npresented by gaps in regulation concerning accountability of financial institutions reporting\npractices:\n“Despite its potential benefits, our knowledge of its potential risks and how to\naccount on them is still developing ... The financial system is constantly evolving,\nand regulators and supervisors must remain attentive to this evolution and ready to\nact if needed.”\nThe GABV banks achieve an unusually high transparency for the banking sector by\ninforming their stakeholders and the community of the targets of their activities, the levels of the\nprovided funding and the rationale underpinning their decisions. Transparency and accountability\nin sustainable banks are enhanced by the stakeholders’ access to and oversight of the work of the\ngoverning boards. Nonetheless, the GABV banks struggle to receive guidance from regulators on\nthe matters of transparency and accountability and put their own effort in developing innovative\n142\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\napproaches that would appeal to a broad range of their stakeholders. One of the GABV members\nelaborated:\n“Regulation is often behind, which restricts consumer choice. When we started, we\noffered savers a choice of annual interest rate up to 2%, to make this link with the\ncommunity stronger. The regulator was willing to accept this, but the Banking\nOmbudsman Service interfered and excluded us from membership.”\nTherefore, sustainable banks, regardless of their organisational structure, are looking for\neffective strategies of advocating and lobbying local governments and financial regulation\ninstitutions for better policies, legislation and taxation schemes. This will require better\nunderstanding of the specific governance issues of sustainable banking as a business model to\nsuggest possible improvements and adjustments. One of the GABV banks summarised the\nregulatory tensions they experience as a result of their identity plurality:\n“It seems that ... so many of the rules, especially around capital and liquidity, are\nso complex ... The complexity hinders that kind of outside discipline. It seems like\nan inside game with the banks and their supervisors. This should not be the way\nforward. Transparency and clarity of the rules is very important.”\n\n5.4 Governance Challenges\nThe role of board governance in sustainable banks focuses on providing support and\nlegitimisation for the organisational management, as well as strategic guidance on fulfilling the\ncommunity development mission. Previous research discussed the relationship between board\ncharacteristics and performance, in particular board composition, remuneration, accountability\nand legitimacy. This study shows that simultaneous pursuit of the community development and\nthe financial performance goals poses several governance challenges for sustainable banks. One\nof the GABV members provided their outlook on the sustainable approach to governance in\nbanking and the issues they face on the way to implement it:\n“All the processes get affected and need to change: hiring, risk management,\nprocurement practices, liquidity and most importantly, our competences at board\nlevel. New approach to banking cannot come without new approach to governance.”\nThis study showed that sustainable banks are particularly concerned with two\nfundamental attributes of their corporate governance systems: board composition and board\nresponsibilities. The majority of the GABV banks are governed democratically in a wholly\nparticipative and equitable manner. This is believed to reduce the likelihood of abuse of power or\nmisrepresentation of interests:\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\n143\n\n“We identify the best board governance practices and work on more effective and\nefficient implementation of our community-centred banking philosophy in board\noversight functions ... We define clearly who the board should represent and with\nwhat vision.”\nSustainable banks take creative approaches to developing unique innovative solutions\nthat strengthen their communitarian instinct. For instance, in one of the GABV banks from\nCanada members elect 22 Board directors and 114 District Council Delegates to equally represent\nthrough the governing system interests of people living in every part of the province, in which\nthe bank operates. This innovative approach developed by the bank has proven to be very\neffective and has received strong support from the bank’s membership.\nNonetheless, many participants of this study shared that such democratic approach to the\nboard composition poses a risk of undermining the board professionalism, therefore, presenting\nthem with unique challenges of finding a balance between their community-centred and banking\nidentities. Many sustainable banks reported that they struggle to keep the balance between their\naspirations for democratic governance and the professionalism of their boards:\n“Financial regulators are continually adding new directives to the job description\nof a bank director. This job continues to become increasingly complex ... There is\nan increasing number of banking rules and regulations, which our board members\nhave to consider in addition to the fiduciary responsibility that was traditionally\nrequired.”\nIn order to face these challenges, banks develop innovative board governance processes\nsubstantially different from conventional financial institutions. Thus, one GABV member from\nGermany gave three seats on the supervisory board for employee representatives and\nimplemented other measures to strengthen their governance practices:\n“Democratic governance process matters to us ... it is at the core, and we never\nstop working on the challenge. We invite all our clients to take part in discussions\non our products and services ... We also invite all members to our annual meetings\nto hold open discussions there.”\nFurthermore, sustainable banks often assign formal responsibilities around ethics,\nmission and values to their boards of directors. Some of them also form tailored board-level\ncommunity development and responsibilities committees. The purpose of such committees would\ntypically include “both assisting the management with strategy formulation and periodically\nreviewing sustainability performance” (Eccles, Ioannou & Serafeim, 2014). This could be done\nin a form of assisting the management in setting strategy, establishing and evaluating goals,\nintegrating corporate values into daily business operations at all levels and reviewing partnerships\nand relationships that support the resilient and sustainable growth. One of the GABV members\n144\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\ncommented on their experience on addressing governance challenges through such board\ngovernance practices:\n“In the values-based banking context, it is particularly important that a bank\ndirector actively oversees the loan underwriting and administration processes. They\nprovide guidance to managers and ensure values integrity ... It is their role to make\nsure each credit will help us serve our community better.”\nThis study identified that formal responsibilities for ethical issues are grounded at the\nvery core of sustainable financial institutions, which is captured in detailed and sophisticated\nspecifications of different values-related committees and their functions:\n“It is our board’s responsibility to determine which committees we need to achieve\nour mission ... Our directors serve on multiple committees and periodically rotate\nmembership to achieve optimal objectivity. The challenge for us is to find the right\nbalance between maintaining knowledge and gaining new perspectives.”\nFor example, in a GABV bank from Canada three out of nine standing committees work\non problems related to ethics and community responsibilities. Thus, the Conduct Review\nCommittee is responsible for overseeing conduct and ethical business standards. The Co-op\nPrinciples and Traditions Committee stands for ensuring that their co-operative values and\ntraditions remain healthy and robust. Finally, the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee\nworks on researching and recommending corporate social responsibility policies to the board of\ndirectors.\nThe centrality of the community benefit mission in sustainable banks gives it a significant\nlegitimising role on the board performance. Governing boards are expected to provide support to\nmanagers and ensure that their decisions will contribute to fulfilling the organisational mission,\nas well as to increasing the competitiveness and financial resilience:\n“Serving on the board of a community bank offers people with a unique\nopportunity to practically contribute to the economic health of their community. Our\nboard directors form values oversight committees to actively challenge management\ndecisions if situations require.”\nIn this situation, directors need tools that will allow them to effectively demonstrate that\ntheir decisions are proper and appropriate, will have the desirable impact on the community\ndevelopment mission and will lead to the long-term social benefit creation. They approach these\nincreased requirements to board governance as a challenge and feel the need to innovate,\ncooperate and learn to provide the highest standards of governance for the communities in which\nthey are embedded. A GABV member from Canada shared their experience on building a\ndemocratise and inclusive governance process:\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\n145\n\n“We care to achieve a desired board composition in which diversity plays an\ninstrumental role. Skills and other competencies such as understanding our bank’s\nmission and triple bottom line commitment are important ... Board members should\naccurately represent our diverse members and communities. We consider gender,\nage, ethnic and cultural background. All this should be maintained.”\nAnother finding regarding governance challenges of sustainable banks as organisations\nwith multiple identities concerns with their perceptions on the role of leadership. Until recently,\nthe academic literature on the new forms of organising (including sustainable finance\norganisations) has been dominated by the ideas of authentic leadership and the key role of leaders\nin developing and implementing ethical business practices. On the contrary, findings from this\nstudy suggest that the GABV banks generally do not put extra emphasis on characteristics of\nCEOs and managers:\n“Sustainable banks do not build their human resources strategies on individual\nmanagers or leaders with extensive compensation packages. We rely on collective\ngovernance effort, cooperation and community grounding instead.”\nSustainable banks rely on the democratic governance to shape organisational values and\nguide investment policies and practices. Nevertheless, findings from this study suggested that\nmanagement in sustainable banks is generally consistent with the attributes of ethical leadership\nrevealed by Trevino et al. (1998), such as orientation toward others and their development, visible\nethical actions, setting ethical standards and possessing ethical awareness and concern for\nstakeholder effects in decision-making processes. It was further discovered that the GABV banks\nbelieve that all members of an organisation are responsible for ethics and put significant attention\nto attracting, selecting, and retaining the right employees at all levels of their organisations:\n“Our members on all levels share our community values. Unlike banks that only\ncare about profit, here we start with identifying human needs that we want to meet.\nIt is a challenge to deliver financial services that meet those needs, and this is our\nmain focus.”\n\n5.5 Stakeholder Relations Challenges\nThere is a growing belief in the organisational studies that the scale and complexity of\nsocial issues requires serious talent and deep expertise to develop innovative and cost-effective\nsolutions with large-scale impact. Academic literature on pluralistic identity organisations\ngenerally states that it is paramount to ensure the person and organisation fit by hiring individuals,\nwho match the organisational culture, values and needs (Verbos et al., 2007). Findings from this\nstudy confirm previous suggestions that, for the reason that sustainable banks currently hold a\n\n146\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\nrelatively low market share, they struggle to recruit job candidates with experience or training in\nhybrid working environments (Battilana & Lee, 2014). Thus, one of the GABV members shared:\n“The set of skills required to do banking our way is not easy to find. It also covers\nareas of compliance, risk management, consumer relations and internal audits. Soft\nskills like empathy, leadership and creativity ... are also paramount. We need\nbalanced people.”\nAnother GABV member bank added:\n“We are smaller than the High Street banks, and we need new skills. We innovate\nand it is easier for us to see the skills that we do not need than it is to see those new\nskills which may be required [to bank on values].”\nThis study further discovered that, even though the GABV banks look for co-workers,\nwho believe in banking on values and the community development mission, in their hiring\npolicies they prioritise professionalism and expertise. The GABV banks shared that they find less\nchallenging teaching bankers to integrate ethical judgements in their work than teaching people\nwith suitable values to be bankers:\n“We want a workforce that represents well the communities where our members\nlive and work and of course they have to possess financial expertise. Professionalism\nis at the core of what we want, similar to alignment with our vision and values ...\nWe cannot accept a trade-off.”\nAs a result, sustainable banks face the need to develop effective socialising mechanisms\nto help their co-workers adjust to the nature of their projects and their working culture.\nSocialisation may be formal or informal and can include different processes, such as orientation\nprograms, training and mentoring. Sustainable banks also invest in building organisational\ncapabilities through research and development, information systems, training and marketing:\n“The competition in search for talent keeps growing, the job market is competitive.\nThe need to up-skill has never been more important than it is now ... Sustainable\nbanks need candidates who can embrace change, be flexible and open to learning\nnew skills and unlearning old ones ... It is a combination of talent search and\ntraining.”\nFindings from this research further propose that, even though there is no widely accepted\nsustainable banking model and sustainable banks innovate to develop authentic procedures to\nbuild mutually beneficial relationships with their employees, certain techniques have proven to\nbe particularly effective for this process:\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\n147\n\n“We support learning and encourage our employees to never stop gaining new\nskills, which they could apply based on their knowledge and expertise to better serve\nour community members.”\nThus, the GABV banks pointed to the relevance of information availability, low staff\nturnover, high levels of employee respect and loyalty and inclusive decision making to increase\nboth the employee satisfaction and productivity in achieving the common-good goals. Such\nstandards of organisational employee relations they believe to contribute to eliminating the likehood of tensions between multiple goals by bringing together people that wish to work towards\nthe community development and simultaneously enjoy the benefits of the commercial sector\nemployment:\n“With the help of our committed employees we build an organisation that moves\nfast and adapts to the changing needs of the community ... Having the right talent\nwithin our bank is crucial to realise new opportunities and contribute to the real\neconomy.”\nThe academic literature on sustainable finance organisations also discussed the relevance\nof organisational reward systems for shaping the behaviour of employees. On the contrary, this\nstudy discovered that the GABV banks generally do not make use of reward systems based on\nthe achieved community impact neither for their management, nor boards, nor employees:\n“As a living wage employer, we are committed to providing a total compensation\npackage to our co-workers that is in line with our values and strategic direction. It\nneeds to be competitive in the banking industry and respectful of people’s skills and\nexperience ... Our rewards are clear and reflect many factors, not just profitability.”\nSustainable banks thrive to create an internal culture that praises good intentions and\nefforts to support the community, to choose suitable projects and to make investment decisions\nthat align with the organisational values. The GABV banks also mentioned that they would\nstruggle to directly link the results of their work to compensation due to the direct community\nimpact being hard to estimate and quantify. Besides, time horizons of sustainable investments are\ngenerally longer, which often results in the postponed social, ecological and economic effects:\n“We believe that the process we take to achieve our results matters more than the\nresults themselves. Our goal is to have performance management framework that\nfully reflects our vision of the path we want to take to growth and impact and helps\nto keep our employees focused on this mission.”\nSustainable banks are generally characterised by higher levels of community engagement\ncompared to the conventional financial institutions. Indeed, many organisations that participated\nin this study are deeply embedded in their communities (particularly those using the credit\n\n148\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\ncooperative model), others, however, emphasise connectivity over localism. For example, a\nGABV bank from the Netherlands that currently also has branches in the United Kingdom,\nBelgium, Germany and Spain, puts great emphasis on communication technologies and online\nbanking technologies to stay in touch with its customers then on personal interactions. It has\ndeveloped a Java based interactive banking application called Triton, which allows its customers\nto see the details of projects that were financed from the deposits in different regions. The bank\nmember explained:\n“We see potential in how modern technology could bring greater engagement and\nresponsibility on both sides ... And most importantly, it can help build up new and\nstronger relationships, and overcome the challenge of staying connected with\ncustomers and responding to their calls in a timely manner.”\nDespite differences in mechanisms and strategies, most sustainable banks confirmed that\nthe success of their business models and their missions depends greatly on building mutually\nbeneficial relations with their clients and investors. One of the GABV organisations commented:\n“Many people do not understand the link between their money and the world\naround them. They think they do not need to know about finance ... But without\ntheir input community banking cannot move forward.”\nThis research further uncovered that with practices of financial inclusion, alternative\nguarantee systems, authentic credit risk assessment and purpose-driven funds allocation,\nsustainable banks demonstrate genuine commitment to their depositors and borrowers beyond\nwhat is offered by the conventional financial institutions. Whereas commercial enterprises\ngenerally think of their consumers as customers and non-profits think of their consumers as\nbeneficiaries, sustainable banks break this customer-beneficiary dichotomy by providing\nproducts and services that, when consumed, produce community value (Battilana & Lee, 2014).\nWhen consumption yields both revenue and community value, customers and beneficiaries\nbecome indistinguishable, especially in member owned cooperatives. When customers and\nbeneficiaries become the same, focusing on growth no longer takes resources away from\nbeneficiaries, but instead the higher economic growth ensures greater fulfilment of the\ncommunity development mission. A GABV member from the UK expressed their vision:\n“... more needs to be done to build the capacity of society to mobilise change.\nPeople need to become more organised and strategic, get interest in managing their\now finds and challenge the status quo. Only this way we can challenge whose benefit\nthe system works for.”\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\n149\n\nThe existing literature further suggested that the duality of performance objectives in\norganisations that combine the community development and the commercial institutional logics\nendangers the community development mission due to the natural temptation to employ wellestablished evaluation metrics covering financial results more often than ambiguous and\ncontested tools for analysing social outputs (Brakman Reiser & Dean, 2013). Indeed, the GABV\nbanks commented on multiple issues around reporting practices and standards:\n“Overall, most [conventional banks] are managing basic compliance. The quality\nand coherence of this information is not up to the level investors need to make their\ndecisions. Industry needs to move beyond compliance.”\nThe GABV banks employ advanced reporting standards to achieve high levels of\ntransparency and accountability for the community development goals:\n“Markets are very helpful in terms of allocating capital. But markets need to have\ngood information ... When banks report with information that is not good, it causes\ntoo many uncertainties and risks in the financial system.”\nSustainable banks experience pressures to inform their stakeholders and the community\nof the targets of their activities, the levels of provided funding and the rationale underpinning\ntheir decisions. Such reporting requirements oftentimes put sustainable banks under the risk of\ncreating an information overload and losing the substance. One of the GABV banks pointed out:\n“It is crucial that consumers understand how the financial system works. If they\ndo, they will be better able to monitor and control where their money goes. The\nfinancial system is too complex for many people, and they do not have access to\neasily digestible information ... We want to help them stop being excluded from it.”\nAnother GABV member shared similar thoughts on the issues they face with reporting\npractices and stakeholder communication:\n“With more financial education and information, there will be a more democratic\nparticipation than the current ‘behind closed doors’ approach. We need it to achieve\ngreater community engagement in governance.”\nFindings from this research suggests that the challenge of ensuring high levels of member\nparticipation in sustainable banks is further complicated by the diversity of clients they serve,\nboth depositors and borrowers. Despite the general support for the banking on values movement,\npeople are driven by different motives to bank with the sustainability focused financial\ninstitutions, which might predetermine their responses to member engagement activities of those\nbanks:\n\n150\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\n“There is a real potential to sharpen the message around sustainable finance and\nbanking ... We would like to increase awareness and start having a bigger influence.”\nBesides, these findings confirm claims made by Iriana and Buttle’s (2007) research on\nsustainable banks that a relatively high number of their clients still prefer to be only passively\ninvolved in the community development and is not looking forward to participate in governance.\nThe hybrid nature of sustainable financial institutions has implications for their ability to mobilise\nsupport from members, sponsors and authorities. Furthermore, sustainable banks put emphasis\non measuring the community impact, which does not necessarily equal stakeholder satisfaction:\n“Our community is diverse, and there is a lot of space for making contribution. It\nis our daily work to identify matters that are most salient for our customers ... We\ntry to support all good causes brought to our attention ... Improving community\nwelfare is a step by step process.”\nTherefore, the diversity of community needs and expectations make stakeholder relations\nchallenges particularly salient for sustainable banks. If sustainability or long-term resilience is\nthe main quality expected and desired from a bank by all stakeholders, other contradicting\nexpectations could be compromised and made less salient by being treated as subordinate to this\nmain performance goal.\n\n5.6 Project Assessment Challenges\nPrevious research suggested that decision-making process is the point where the\nformulated organisational values become values in use. Actions are driven by what the\norganisational culture teaches people inside the enterprise to think, feel and perceive about the\nproblems they face as an organisation (Verbos et al., 2007). Academics and practitioners\ngenerally agree this to be the most critical instance, where a process must align with the\norganisational mission and values. Findings from this research indicated that sustainable banks\nface a challenge of building project assessment processes committed to both the community\ndevelopment mission and the financial efficiency of operations. To achieve this goal,\nmanagement should identify and communicate organisational values that strike a healthy balance\nbetween commitment to both the capital gains and the social benefit. One of the GABV members\nshared their experience of working on meeting dual identity requirements in their project\nevaluation:\n“In the existing system, success of a bank is still mainly measured by monetary\ngains. Social and environmental effects are barely considered ... We need to include\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\n151\n\nthose two dimensions, or bottom lines, and make them comparable to make informed\ndecisions.”\nSimilar as the conventional financial institutions, sustainable banks aim to supply the\nhighest quality financial products and remain economically viable. Contrary to them, however,\nvalues-based banks possess a unique understanding of their role within the communities in which\nthey are embedded and seek to use market systems in a way that would allow to achieve mutual\nbenefit for their business, society and environment. A GABV institution explained the issues they\nobserve with the current approach to project assessment within banks:\n“A problem with current sustainability metrics ... [is] that they often account for\nstrategies but do not assess how they are implemented in practice. It is a complicated\nprocess to measure how sustainability is embedded in culture ... But it is not an\nimpossible task if processes are tracked from strategy through implementation to\nresults.”\nIn simultaneously striving for social and economic development, the GABV banks avoid\nengaging into speculative operations and concentrate their activities around money depositing\nand money lending. Moreover, every project they finance should deliver some form of socially\nor environmentally positive outcome consistent with their organisational missions:\n“We start by delivering value to society. We identify a human need that one of our\nclients can help meet. Then we look to deliver banking services in a financially\nsustainable way that can generate return to investors ... We do not ignore the\nfinancial side, but we start with the value we can provide to society.”\nThe sustainable complex approach to project assessment was confirmed by a fellow\nGABV member from Denmark:\n“Our process starts with identifying human needs to be met and enterprises or\nindividuals, who can meet those needs on a sustainable basis. The process includes\nsound financial analysis, ... but the economics come later in the process.”\nFindings from this study confirm that sustainable banks also have longer investment\nhorizons compared to the conventional financial institutions, which require greater patience from\ntheir investors and shareholders. One of the GABV banks commented on their approach to risk\nmanagement in lending and investing:\n“... our mindset of risk management is broader, which helps to reduce risks. As a\ncommunity organisation, we are willing to accept slightly higher risks, not to get\nmore financial rewards but because a project is important for the community.\nBecause of impact.”\n\n152\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\nIt was further discovered that in most cases, values-based organisations are characterised\nby a strong dominant common-good philosophy and consider economic profitability as a means\nto achieve their community development goals:\n“We believe that these are the needs that values-based banks should focus on ...\nWe help create economic resilience ... We address the issues of environmental\nregeneration: not just keeping the environment as it is but actually making it better\nfor next generations. Similarly, we look at social empowerment.”\nAnother GABV member agreed that their approach to project assessment fundamentally\ndiffers from the conventional one within the banking industry. As a result, sustainable banks face\nchallenges of accounting for all the important factors and possible implications:\n“Our approach does not change the fundamentals of our credit methodology ... It\nchanges the order in which we access the implications. Given that the list of factors\nis broader, frameworks should be more sophisticated but also remain concise.”\nPrevious literature reported that sustainable banks have demonstrated enormous success\nin using “hidden or untapped local resources that other organisations fail to recognise, value or\nuse” (Di Domenico, Haugh & Tracey, 2010). Findings from this research reveal that they do not\nfit into the conventional model of social enterprises that build their operations upon limited\nresources and require high level of creativity to create something from nothing:\n“Since the beginning ... we had little guidance on how to distribute resources in\nthe way that is best for the community. But our members always trusted us and there\nwas no shortage of deposits. We were building skills and expertise together with our\nmembers. Now it is our ‘know how’ that we are happy to share.”\nThis study discovered that the GABV banks have developed a clear vision and strategy\nfor financing their operations from the community deposits. Thus, a GABV banks from Canada\nin 2014 financed hundred per cent of its loans from the deposits of its members. Moreover, many\nof the GABV banks reported that they receive sufficient funding and often struggle to find\nsuitable community projects to invest the excessive deposit supply:\n“Among all the projects out there, we would look for the ones with clear\ncommunity benefit. But not every project that community members would like us to\nsupport is fully aligned with our values ... Sometimes we could get aligned, but not\nalways of course.”\nDriven by strict ethical screening criteria and limited by high levels of transparency and\naccountability, they find the processes of project selection and credit approval to be demanding\nand challenging. Investment decisions in the GABV banks are based on complex evaluations of\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\n153\n\nfinancial characteristics and potential community benefits, which require both banking expertise\nand deep understanding of the sustainability component. A bank from Italy shared their\nexperience:\n“It is important to engage members in credit decisions. They [credit decisions] are\nthe most essential decision-making within the bank. To contribute, members need to\nreceive training in how to assess borrowers ... Members need to be included, they\nbring localised insights into this process. Their assessment then needs to be passed\nto a credit analyst and become a part of the credit submission ... In our bank members\nhave a right of veto.”\nInvestment decisions in sustainable banks are based on complex evaluations of financial\ncharacteristics and potential community benefits, which engage both banking expertise of the\nemployees and their deep understanding of the moral component. A bank from Germany\nexplained how they combine these dual goals:\n“Often the most important factor in the whole assessment of a project is its goals\n... We care that not only financial profit is the motivator, but we contribute to a social\nor environmental cause and improvement of well-being.”\nFindings from this study prove that in the GABV banks, financial assessment is not\napproached as superior to compliance with the ethical criteria and the evidence of potential\ncommunity benefit. They see themselves as primarily vehicles to accomplish, strengthen, enhance\nor expand their corporate missions (Alter & Dawans, 2006). As a result, people inside the\norganisations treat both criteria as professional instructions that have to be followed for successful\nperformance. Thereby, simultaneous pursuit of the dual identities has often forced managers to\nstay away from debatable projects:\n“We work together with customers to identify their real needs and true costs of\ntheir projects ... Our customers do not always have that knowledge and expertise to\nwrite good proposals and provide detailed explanations. This is why they would\nnever become a client in some High Street banks ... there is work to do together\nbefore we can invest in them.”\nBorrowers of sustainable banks include charities, arts organisations, local community\ngroups, social enterprises, sustainable development organisations, etc. These enterprises need\nfinance for a broad range of reasons, such as providing cash-flow facility to bridge gaps between\ngrants, mortgages for new properties, loans for start-up projects or loans to reschedule debts with\ncreditors. The conventional financial institutions often refuse to provide services to such\nenterprises, because they do not understand their legal structures or their special needs. In other\ncases, these organisations do not have an adequate credit history and are deemed too high risk.\nFindings from this research reveal that driven by the aim to extend banking services to such\n154\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\nfinancially excluded individuals and businesses, the GABV banks often have to rely on rather\nsubjective evaluations.\n“We support projects that bring positive value to the community but that is very\ncontext sensitive. Our communities deserve help and commitment ... As a regulated\nfinancial institution, we do not have complete freedom in supporting every cause,\nbut we are prepared to walk an extra mile to support our members’ needs.”\nThe challenge is further complicated by differences among the contexts of operation,\nwhich range from the most developed economies to the emerging markets. Sustainable banks,\nparticularly those operating in the developing countries, have to factor-in how business decisions\nwould connect with non-business factors, such as politics, history and human conditions:\n“Some entrepreneurs have financial capacity that is too limited to be able to take\non debt or repay it. Government often is also not in the position to support them ...\nValues-based banks can make a real difference for communities in developing\ncountries, who struggle from financial exclusion the most. And there is space for\nconventional banks too.”\nAs pointed out by Cowton and Thompson (2001), sustainable banking activities are\nintentionally designed to be different from those of the conventional financial institutions. They\nsimultaneously thrive for the community impact and the economic profitability by funding\neconomic activities with social or environmental benefits and refraining from speculative\noperations. Findings from this study confirm that the GABV banks aim at channelling deposits\nreceived from their community members into loans for other members in need of extra finance –\nfamilies, businesses and community organisations. Therefore, they require innovative credit\nmechanisms and most importantly alternative guarantee systems, which would allow sustainable\nbanks to put money into projects or persons not attended by the conventional banks:\n“It is very important to keep supporting financial inclusion with everything we do.\nThis includes expansion of banking and financial services in the rural areas,\npromotion of mobile banking and branchless banking, continuation of government\nled programs and the implementation of subsidised programs ... Banking cannot\nbecome more inclusive with our collective effort and innovative assessment.”\n\n5.7 Chapter Summary\nThis chapter presented the findings on how sustainable banks, members of the GABV,\ncombine the economic and the ethical roles. It was discovered that these organisations experience\nidentity plurality due to their simultaneous commitment to the financial and the community\ndevelopment goals. Sustainable banks describe themselves as simultaneously the economic and\nthe ethical actors and acknowledge that such identity duality creates a number of challenges,\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\n155\n\nwhich they are willing to address in order to remain true to their core. It was found that the GABV\nmembers perceive both sets of goals as indispensable and demonstrate strong awareness of their\norganisational identity plurality and the differences between their approach and the conventional\nbanking.\nMoreover, this chapter discussed the challenges posed by the organisational identity\nplurality for sustainable banks. The GABV members pointed to four major challenges, namely\nregulatory, governance, stakeholder relations and project assessment. Firstly, sustainable banks\nstruggle to meet regulatory requirements and believe that the existing legislation does not equally\naccount for their economic and ethical roles. Secondly, the GABV banks experience governance\nchallenges in their attempts to balance the financial industry professionalism and the democratic\napproach to board governance. Thirdly, sustainable finance and banking organisations face\nidentity plurality challenges in their relations with stakeholders and their attempts to engage with\nthe communities in which they are embedded. Finally, sustainable banks experience unique\nproject assessment challenges due to their desire to combine the financial profitability with the\ncommunity development mission. Therefore, this chapter provided a thorough overview of the\nways sustainable banks experience the organisational identity plurality. The next chapters\ncontinue summarising the research findings and focus on how sustainable banks resolve these\nidentity plurality challenges and liabilities. Chapter 6 presents findings related to the ways the\nGABV members address their liabilities for multiple goals, whereas Chapter 7 discusses how\nthese banks resolve liabilities to multiple principle stakeholder groups.\n\n156\n\nIDENTITY PLURALITY CHALLENGES WITHIN SUSTAINABLE BANKS\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\nSustainable Banking: Identity and Liabilities\n\n6.1 Introduction\nFindings from the study suggest that sustainable banks manage their liabilities for\nmultiple goals through identity work. Identity work can be defined as a process through which\norganisations seek to establish an identity in their own estimation and in the eyes of external\nstakeholders (Alvesson et al., 2008), draw on resources from the institutional setting in order to\nmake identity claims (Watson, 2016) and develop a coherent narrative of the self over time\n(Ybema et al., 2009). Previous literature provided evidence of the organisational identity work\nundertaken through a range of processes including account-giving, struggle and conflict\n(Sveningsson & Alvesson, 2003), distancing organisation from particular identity attributions\n(Costas & Fleming, 2009) and appropriation of resources used for identity labelling (Musson &\nDuberley, 2007). While some of the studies did address the cases of pluralistic identity\norganisations, little insight has been provided on the role of identity work in developing and\nsustaining pluralistic identities. Even though it has been discussed by previous studies that\nidentity work can lead to the resolution of identity tensions (Alvesson et al., 2008; Bain et al.,\n2005), no evidence has been presented on the exact tactics that could be employed by pluralistic\nidentity organisations to combine multiple logics without causing a mission drift. Findings from\nthis research on sustainable banks fill these gaps in knowledge and contribute to our\nunderstanding of the ways pluralistic identity organisations balance the ethical and the economic\nsides of their strategies though identity work.\nThis chapter summarises identity work tactics that sustainable banks from the GABV use\nto combine the community development and the banking goals and address the tensions that arise\nfrom their simultaneous pursuit (discussed in Chapter 5). Study participants were asked specific\nquestions probing for how sustainable banks respond to their identity plurality. Through the\nqualitative research process, several distinct identity work tactics were discovered. After coding\nand analysing all interviews, observation notes and documents, these tactics were organised into\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\n157\n\nthree broad classifications of identity work: critiquing, contextualising and intervening tactics.\nTable 12 summarises the identity work tactics developed by the GABV banks to address their\nliabilities for the simultaneous pursuit of the community relations and the banking goals.\nTABLE 12. IDENTITY WORK TACTICS\nTactic\n\nDescription\n\nCritiquing tactics\n\nDetecting\n\nIdentifying the areas and customers unaddressed by conventional\nbanking products and services and extending financial services to\npreviously excluded or under-served categories.\n\nDistancing\n\nEmphasising strategic and operational differences between the\nconventional and sustainable ways of banking.\n\nContextualising tactics\nHistoricising\n\nPutting emphasis on supporting local traditions within the\ncommunities in which sustainable banks operate.\n\nLocalising\n\nDeveloping services and products by learning from the needs and\nexpectations of their local communities.\n\nCooperating\n\nCooperating with like-minded organisations and institutions and\nbuilding partnerships to grow the sustainable banking market\ncategory.\n\nIntervening tactics\n\nIncluding\n\nProviding financial services with inclusive approach towards\ncategories of customers generally excluded by conventional banks,\noffering customer individually sourced and tailored products to fulfil\ntheir needs.\n\nInitiating\n\nProviding highly innovative and unconventional products and services\nto address the needs of their customers and support their development.\n\nEmpowering\n\nInspiring customers and communities to develop sustainable business\nmodels and supporting them with finance and expertise along the way.\n\nSource: Author (2019)\n\n158\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\n6.2 Critiquing tactics\nThe first category of identity work tactics employed by sustainable banks to manage their\nidentity plurality focuses on “critiquing” through the practices of detecting and distancing.\nCritiquing tactics aim at understanding how the sustainable banking engenders and solidifies the\nconventional forms of financial services. Critique is arguably an indispensable step to embrace\nthe “otherness” of sustainable banking as it stimulates an understanding of how it differs from the\nconventional forms of financial services. Findings from this study suggest that the GABV banks\napproach the critiquing of the conventional banking in two modes: by detecting its pitfalls and by\ndistancing themselves from those unsustainable practices.\n6.2.1 Detecting\nMany participants of this study mentioned that a large part of defining the sustainable\nbanking identity is extending financial services to the previously excluded or underserved\ncategories of customers. In order to achieve this goal, the GABV banks put substantial effort to\nidentifying individuals, organisations and whole regions that remain neglected by conventional\nbanks. Thus, a GABV member from the Bangladesh commented:\n“Our client was inspired to set up an agricultural business, having learnt from his\nfather’s farm. So, in 1995, he decided to start his own poultry farm with the help of\nhis father ... But this needed investment – something that the traditional banking\nsector would not extend to him without a formal banking history. And that is where\nGreenSouth bank came in.”\nSimilarly, other respondents also admitted that an essential part of their work is to identify\nareas and causes where they can contribute to communities in which they are embedded and offer\nsupport. A GABV bank from the U.S. is a great example of an organisation that was very effective\nin finding unaddressed issues in their local community and offering financial services to support\nimportant initiatives within the American farming industry. American farmers have long\nwitnessed pressures from low milk prices and real estate developments forcing small family run\ncompanies out of business. Young entrepreneurs from a local community came up with an idea\nthat renewable energy might offer a way to sustain small farms and help reverse a long-term trend\nin America: the loss of farmland and farmers. In 2007, local entrepreneurs founded a collaborative\norganisation that built and operated milk digesters for dairy farms in the region, to provide local\ndairy farmers with the solution they have been looking for:\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\n159\n\n“These people were looking for a way that energy could bring new value to farms,\nnot just repackage the old values.”\nTheir business idea included using communally shared milk digesters, producing\nrenewable energy out of waste products, which would be collectively operated by a group of local\nfarmers to share costs and revenues. Such community approach of the entrepreneurs would allow\nto reduce the costs of cow bedding, increase bacterial control and water quality, and provide local\nfarmers with opportunities for revenue sharing. The interviewee from the GABV bank shared:\n“We are part of the community and we know its needs. We take the time to sit\ndown and understand unique situation and goals of farmers. No two farms are alike.\nAnd no two farmers are alike.”\nIt should be noted that by the time the entrepreneurs founded their company, benefits of\nthe renewable energy technologies had been explored by very few dairy businesses in America.\nDespite the successful experience of these technologies being implemented across many\nEuropean countries, American dairymen of that time remained sceptical about the reliability of\nthe renewable energy solutions. Their scepticism towards the community approach of the\nfounders was further powered by the U.S. system of price control for milk and dairy products.\nBefore putting in operation their first digester, the entrepreneurs spent considerable time to inform\nlocal communities about their business promise and build relationships with farmers. The GABV\nbank’s representative shared:\n“They enacted the concept of no sudden moves, because the last thing that you\nwant to happen with a project like this is that people would get surprised and start to\nfeel the, ‘not in my backyard’ syndrome.”\nA chorus of rejections from conventional banks brought the founders to a sustainable\nlender from the GABV, who was the first financial services provider to see the value and market\npotential in the idea of mitigating dairy business risks through the community approach. The\nenterprise currently owns and operates five farm power sites in its state, providing local dairy\nproductions with up to 4.25MW of renewable electricity. The GABV bank regarded this\ninvestment as a case that benefited multiple areas of their identity, mission and values. One of the\nboard directors further said:\n“We supported the community-based dairy biogas projects in that region from its\nvery beginning and over a number of years. We were a key support for their\ninnovative approach to achieving their goal of creating new revenue streams for\nsmall local dairy farms.”\n\n160\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\n6.2.2 Distancing\nMost of the interviewees believe that sustainable banks significantly differ in their\napproach and performance from the conventional banks. Findings from this study suggest that, at\nthis stage of the sustainable finance development, the GABV banks deem it important for their\nidentity to emphasise the existing strategic and operational differences between the two ways of\ndoing banking. A bank from the U.S. shared:\n“For the first time, a bank was interested in helping its clients business grow. We\nvisited the factory, saw how they make things and talked to their employees.\nTogether we drafted a loan agreement that worked for both parties.”\nPointing to the differences between conventional and sustainable banking approaches was\na notable motive in all the interviews. This could be attributed to the current unsustainable state\nof financial system and the desire of sustainable banks to make positive impact, which could not\nbe achieved without reflection on the existing practices that need to be modified and replaced. A\nGABV bank from France further added:\n“Our core business fundamentally differentiates us from other banks. Our expertise\nmakes us aware of the concerns of our social economy customers. And each of us\nbenefits from the other’s knowledge: we know the issues GreenNorth bank faces and\nthey know the constraints we have as a bank.”\nSustainable banks find truly important to explain how their approach could improve\nexisting practices and address the currently neglected needs and problems. Another bank from\nU.S. expanded:\n“I could immediately tell the difference between the community banks and regular\nbanks, where a partnership was never on the table, just a spreadsheet.”\nThis identity work of sustainable banks is further illustrated well by a story of two owners\nof a ceramics production factory from the U.S. In 2003, the entrepreneurs decided to open a bigger\nfacility, which would allow to design, produce and showroom their products within one location.\nThey tried to partner with local banks to finance this expansion but failed to find understanding.\nAt the conventional banks they tried to approach, a partnership was never on the table, just a\nspreadsheet. Despite the factory being a stable business generating profit, local banks only offered\nto lend the owners the maximum amount of money they could pay back based on the current\nincome. After several discouraging meetings with five local banks, the entrepreneurs were\nintroduced to a GABV bank, who demonstrated some serious interest in helping them grow. They\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\n161\n\noffered a $2 million term loan supported by a $250,000 credit line to finance the construction\nproject. An interviewee commented:\n“We visited the factory, saw how they make things and talked to their employees.\nTogether we drafted a loan agreement that worked for both parties.”\nThe GABV bank’s board director noted that such approach based on the detailed attention\nto clients’ needs lays at the core of their organisational philosophy. He further emphasised that,\nunlike the conventional banks that are predominantly focused on profitability, they account for\nintangible factors, such as the community impact and the integrity of people involved. He further\nadded:\n“We are a relationship bank. Because we take time to understand an organisation’s\nneeds and market, we assess risk differently.”\n\n6.3 Contextualising tactics\nThe second group of identity work tactics employed by sustainable banks represents\n“contextualising” and explains how the sustainable banking could be shaped through the practices\nof historicising, localising and cooperating. Contextualising reflects upon how each sustainable\nfinancial institution is linked to a particular local and historical context and, by implication, how\nchanges in the banking services provision coincide not only with innovative developments but\nalso with the forgotten traditions of the community banking and finance. While the “critiquing”\ntactics help to outline the existing boundaries by which the sustainable banking identity is\ndelineated, “contextualising” identity work informs the sustainable banking identity in\npurposefully linking it to the historical forms of the community financial practices, local traditions\nof baking and existing networks of sustainable organisations from different fields.\n6.3.1 Historicising\nSustainable banks put great emphasis on supporting local traditions within the\ncommunities in which they are embedded. They pay increased attention and learn from the\nhistorical examples of financial services that were locally developed in their communities.\nMoreover, they tend to adopt organisational forms that best reflect their community approach to\nbanking and allow to include customers as beneficiaries, such as credit union, building society or\nbenefit corporation. A GABV member from Italy shared:\n“As a bank we are fully aligned with the values of local community, which is why\nthey have been its main financial partner since we started ... We support various\n\n162\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\nsocial and cultural initiatives and pay attention to the traditions people care about.\nThey need to be preserved.”\nAnother bank from Serbia also mentioned:\n“We supported this little craft shop in the neighbourhood, which is based on a\nconcept of family business. Without any employees, services of upholstery and\nreparation are provided by the client and his wife, with the help of their son. During\nthe thirteen-year-long partnership with the bank, our client has repaid 7 loans and\ncurrently has one active loan. These loans were used as means to realise his goals,\none by one, with an aim to improve his business. The business that has always been\nhere and that this community values.”\nFor a GABV bank from Mongolia it would have been impossible to reach their local\ncustomers without building their approach on respecting local customs and following local\ntraditions of financial relationships. The bank is located in an area of Ulaanbaatar, which is\nsometimes referred to as the coldest capital city in the world. Winter season could last for as long\nas from September to May, with average temperatures staying around -30° Celsius. Local people\nlive in wooden houses or traditional Mongolian felt tents called gers. Struggling to keep warm,\nmany locals use inefficient stoves burning 4.5 tons of coal per year because alternative sources\nare substantially more expensive. Equipping a ger with a fuel efficient stove would cost\napproximately 350,000 Mongolian Tugrik ($133) and alternative methods of heat preservation,\nsuch as improved insulation (ger blankets) and door coverings, have market prices upwards of\n600,000 Mongolian Tugrik ($230). Both measures seem too expensive for a community with an\naverage household income of 180,000 Mongolian Tugrik ($72) per month:\n“The problem was urgent for local population. Crucial. But no financial support\nhas been offered to help people address it and improve their quality of living. This is\nwhere we stepped in.”\nThis situation resulted in two sets of social and environmental problems. Firstly, the cost\nof fuel consumes up to 30% of a local household’s annual income, forcing people to divert\nessential funds from food, clothing and children support. Secondly, the massive quantity of coal\nburned contributes 60% of Ulaanbaatar’s pollution, making it the second most polluted city in the\nworld. The GABV bank carefully studied the situation and proposed its own decision: a network\nof product centres situated within the ger districts and selling energy-efficient products subsidised\nby the Clean Air Fund of Mongolia and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The GABV\nmember established a micro loan program to support low-income local clients in making these\nessential purchases, which is characterised by relaxed collateral requirements, reduced interest\nrates and flexible loan repayment terms. Installing energy efficiency measures with the support\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\n163\n\nof the GABV bank’s micro loan program helped their clients reduce their fuel consumption by\nup to 50%, allowing people to spend more on food and other basic necessities:\n“As a bank we support the efforts of local people to help themselves and save their\nown problems. They are the ones who really know both the problem and its solution.”\nThese days, the program has reached over 100,000 households across the historic\nUlaanbaatar region ger communities. This initiative has made great contribution not only to\npeople’s quality of life, but also to Ulaanbaatar’s air quality, establishing a standard for\nenvironmental consciousness that will be followed for years to come.\n\n6.3.2 Localising\nFindings from this study further suggest that sustainable banks excel at developing their\nservices and products learning from the needs and expectations of their local communities. Some\nof the respondents described the sustainable banking approach as developing highly tailored and\nadaptable solutions for the unique problems faced by local community members and addressing\neach situation individually. Thus, a GABV member from the U.S. focused on environmental\nissues, which provides unique locally focused funds for renewable energy initiatives, commented:\n“Lending opportunities that benefit multiple areas of the bank’s mission set, such\nas on-farm renewable energy systems, are of high value. We offer local solutions\nthat could help our clients ultimately be successful in their mission to help their\nneighbours and advance the renewable energy industry.”\nOther bank from Western Uganda further explained how they supported a project of\nstrategic importance for the community in which they are embedded. Finding financing solution\nfor the factory was paramount for supporting local population, protecting their income and\nensuring their future:\n“This factory is one of four factories formerly owned by Uganda Tea Growers\nCorporation ... The factory is the main source of income to 800 families in local\nDistricts. We played a major financing role in its growth over the years, providing in\nexcess of US 2.5 billion in loans. As a result, the company has overhauled its entire\nproduction line and doubled its production capacity from 35,000 tons of tea per day\nto 80,000 tones.”\nAnother example is a GABV bank from Vancouver area of Canada, which has long faced\na problem of providing local parents and caregivers with access to fully certified and ethically\nrun day care centres. A local day care organisation offers flexible, occasional childcare that\nparents can schedule online or through a smartphone application. The interviewee explained their\napproach and the concept:\n164\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\n“People can use it for one hour at a time or they can book with an hour’s notice if\nsomething pops up. Parents often have spontaneous childcare needs and they offer\nscheduling that suits their needs.”\nMoreover, the centre practices environmentally friendly approach with organic snacks,\nlow-water-usage washing, an indoor worm compost and a small herb garden, where kids can learn\nabout growing organic food. Such environmentally friendly approach, combined with the value\nof its business model, made the centre a natural fit for the GABV bank’s micro loan program.\nHowever, to start their centre, the entrepreneurs required an amount of money that the GABV\nbank could not approve single-handedly. Determined to support the entrepreneurs in addressing\nthe community needs through their sustainable business approach, the bank collaborated with\nanother capital provider, who shared their vision and was able to offer additional loan and a grant.\nTogether the GABV bank and its partners made the Vancouver parents dream possible.\nSoon after opening in 2011, demand for such child-care services proved to be very high.\nBank representative noted that the centre has been particularly popular among self-employed,\nhome-based businesspeople and stay-at-home parents. She commented on it:\n“Childcare in Vancouver is in very high demand, and there aren’t a lot of options\nfor families. A lot of families end up being in a position where they don’t really get\nwhat they need.”\nShe elaborated on the centre’s welcoming inclusive relations with the day care customers:\n“They have an environment where the whole spectrum of Vancouver lifestyles fit\nwith us. They have families of all different cultures. They have people with all\ndifferent types of jobs. They’re inclusive.”\n\n6.3.3 Cooperating\nSustainable banks from the sample expressed high willingness to cooperate with likeminded organisations and institutions and develop successful partnerships. They effectively\nidentify organisations that share their values and vision to provide best services and products for\ntheir clients and communities in which they operate. Thus, a GABV member from the U.S. said:\n“We help organisations secure financing through the local government and other\npartners, which allow businesses to grow more rapidly. We always search for ways\nto help them re-finance and get the best deal.”\nCommunity partnerships and cooperation with like-minded organisations is deemed\nimportant by both GreenNorth and GreenSouth banks. A GABV bank from Denmark further\nexplained that they work locally to build networks of organisations that could support each other\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\n165\n\nand foster development. Such approach great benefits community entrepreneurs and small\nbusiness, who can learn to rely on each other, rather than financial support from the outside:\n“We have a great network within our working field and try to link our clients to\neach other. If, for example, the client needed help with his website or another part of\nhis business, we would probably be able to put him in contact with some of our other\nclients that provide this kind of service. We often work in this way.”\nA bank from Germany shared similar experience of building local partnerships and\nconnecting like-minded companies to support self-sufficiency of local community:\n“Having the expertise in special sectors like education, health and care facilities,\naccommodation, organic farming and renewable energy not only makes us an equal\npartner, it gives entrepreneurs the possibility to be a part of a network, collaborating\nwith other entrepreneurs in the same sector. For example, this client is joining a\nkindergarten network established by GreenNorth bank, which enables him to\nexchange views on day-to-day challenges.”\nA GABV bank from the U.S. shared an initiative they launched in cooperation with local\nauthorities and entrepreneurs to strengthen local economy in Vermont by empowering members\nto invest locally. Until 2014, local investment opportunities were exclusively available to high\nnet worth accredited investors, who met strict conditions: earned $200,000 or more in annual\nincome or had net worth greater than $1 million. Vermont Small Business Offering (VSBO)\nlegislation removed previously existing barriers and opened local investment opportunities to all\nVermonters:\n“Vermont has a rich entrepreneurial history and spirit. It was important for us to\nhelp local small businesses and start-ups to finance their growth.”\nThe community, however, still lacked financial education and effective tools to make a\npositive impact with their investment dollars. In 2015, the GABV bank combined its efforts with\nMilk Money company and the Department of Financial Regulation (DFR) to breach this gap and\nconnect small scale investors with entrepreneurs. Milk Money developed an equity platform to\nconnect interested parties and equip them with educational and networking opportunities as well\nas investment options, however, they required both financial and legislative support to launch it.\nThe GABV bank worked closely with DFR to create legal underpinning of the crowd-funding\nplatform they created together with Milk Money and configure the platform to comply with DFR\nregulations. The GABV bank shared that the process involved many innovative decisions and\nlearning opportunities for all parties due to the pioneering nature of the created platform:\n\n166\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\n“Now Vermonters can discover local investment opportunities featured on the\nwebsite, get support for evaluating and comparing opportunities, and invest directly\nthrough the website.”\nAt the core of the GABV bank’s practices lays a shared believe that “what someone does\nwith their money is an expression of their values.” Now, four years after the launch of the Milk\nMoney platform, Milk Money, the GABV bank’s specialists believed that it has enhanced the\nfinancial paradigm of the Vermont investment ecosystem. Successful cooperative effort of the\nMilk Money platform enabled people of Vermont to more directly support local businesses they\nvalue. This experience brought together three partners to accomplish something none of them\ncould have done individually and provide benefits to all the Vermonters. One of the GABV bank’s\nco-workers shared:\n“One small investment can lead to multiple investments that strengthen the local\neconomy. This is small money-making big change. As the Milk Money platform\ntakes off and people increasingly recognise it as a way to raise working capital or\nmake impactful local investments, the state will achieve greater social and economic\nsustainability. Financial institutions and advisors play a direct role in it.”\n\n6.4 Intervening tactics\nA third category of the identity work tactics employed by sustainable banks to address\ntheir liabilities for multiple goals, labelled “intervening”, complements the “critiquing” and\n“contextualising” practices discussed above. These tactics explicitly focus on changing the role\nof banking in society through the practices of including, initiating and empowering. Intervening\nconsiders how banking could be transformed to promote more effectively and efficiently social\nchange and support local communities. These identity work tactics address the complexity of the\nfinancial services’ outreach and stand for the interventionist dimension of the sustainable\nbanking.\n6.4.1 Including\nFindings from this study reveal that the sustainable banking model is more inclusive than\nthe one of conventional banks. The GABV banks are highly embedded in their local communities,\nand name stretching their services to reach previously under-served categories of customers as\none of the core goals of their activities. A GABV member from Bolivia expanded:\n“Some clients tell we’ve been like a father to them, we have helped them very\nmuch. We gave them the opportunity and the loans they needed to invest and grow\nin their businesses, just at a time when poor people did not have access to banks.\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\n167\n\nWithout this money, most of them would not have been able to turn their dreams into\nreality.”\nAnother GreenNorth bank also agreed that supporting members that were previously\nneglected by conventional institutions remains important in other regions as well. Thus, they work\nto grow small-businesses and micro-entrepreneurs in Europe to help local communities foster.\nThis requires increased innovation, attention to detail and risk management expertise:\n“For us, the success of this initiative further supports our approach to seeing the\nopportunity in small-scale ideas, which might otherwise be overlooked. Having had\nthe right support, the company is now in a position to replicate the model elsewhere\nwith our continued support.”\nA story of including, archetypical among sustainable banks, was shared by the GABV\nmember from Peru. Their client from Puente Piedra in Lima came from troubled background.\nFrom the age of 10, she had to share with her parents responsibilities of caring for their large\nfamily. Years later with a family of her own, motivated to improve the living conditions, the client\nstarted a mini market providing products for her neighbours. The client soon faced the need to\nexpand the range of products sold. Without further investment, the growth of her mini market\nwas not possible, yet local banks were not willing to provide the entrepreneur with a loan,\ndoubting her ability to pay it back. At that time, the lady tried her luck with the local GABV bank,\nand this is how its co-worker reflected on the experience:\n“We listened to her and evaluated her situation. She was ecstatic when we gave her\nthe loan. The experience taught us all the value of good customer service. The lady\ntold us that now she treats her clients the way our bank treated her.”\nThe GABV member did not stop its cooperation with the entrepreneur at providing her\nwith a loan. They offered her a place at their “10,000 Women” training programme developed to\neducate, support and offer networking opportunities to female small business owners. The client\nfound this initiative of the GABV bank particularly useful for her growth as an entrepreneur. My\ninterviewee commented:\n“It teachers entrepreneurs to do things with their business that they previously\nthought impossible and makes them realise the importance of having aspirations.”\nToday, from the comfort of her house the lady runs several businesses: a mini-market,\ninternet booth, fast food stand and catering business, as well as selling electric domestic\nappliances on the side. The GABV bank’s specialist commented:\n“It is a pleasure to support hard-working, dedicated people like this client. For us,\nsupport does not stop after the initial loan, beyond this we aim to support people like\n168\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\nthis entrepreneur through building up their capacities as businesspeople, watching\nthem, as well as their businesses grow. It is this relationship between the bank and\nthe borrower that sets us apart from other financial institutions.”\n\n6.4.2 Initiating\nSustainable banks do not only tailor their products and services to address the local needs\nand to develop the communities in which they are embedded, they also constantly work to develop\nhighly innovative solutions for the challenges their customers face. They get actively involved in\nthe life of their communities and propose initiatives to tackle the existing cases of hardships and\ninequality. Thus, a GABV bank from Switzerland shared:\n“We channel money from investors who decide on which specific purpose their\nmoney will be used... We know our community really well and know the areas that\nneed more attention. These problems usually cannot be solved by the conventional\napproach. It is innovation and willingness to try new ways that help the most.”\nAnother GreenNorth institution agreed, that findings more effective ways to support local\nfamilies and individuals is paramount to help communities prosper. A European GABV bank\nexplained:\n“The work we do goes beyond that of a conventional bank, we provide advice and\nsupport along the way. This is crucial for any idea taking off... We are not afraid to\ndo what others don’t.”\nA great example of such willingness to initiate has been discovered at a GABV bank from\nEurope, who shared a story about its involvement with an enterprise Bristol Together. Bristol\nTogether is a Community Interest Company that provides employment to ex-offenders, enabling\nthem to have a fresh start in life. It offers ex-offenders jobs at the construction sites of properties\npurchased at auctions, which would equip them with the skills necessary to become builders and\neventually get back into full-time employment:\n“The ambition is to help, and support disadvantaged and socially excluded people\nachieve their potential. A criminal record can make it hard for people to find jobs.\nInitiatives like this one help to make it easier and show how people can turn their\nlives around.”\nThe GABV bank took part in the development of this initiative since the project stage. It\noffered the founders support and expertise in building this business from a concept to a viable\ninvestment proposition. The GABV bank’s co-worker told the story:\n“Our work goes beyond that of a conventional bank, providing advice and support\nalong the way. This was crucial to the idea taking off.”\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\n169\n\nAs a true believer in impact investing as a means of delivering both social and financial\nreturns, the GABV member could see the high community benefit of the Bristol Together idea.\nNonetheless, the project lacked a proven pilot model, which was making it a risky investment that\ncould hardly be defended on strictly commercial grounds. The bank was the right partner in the\nprocess to take a long-term view and help entrepreneurs develop a vision for scaling the model\nand replicating it in other cities across the UK. Developing meaningful long-lasting relationships\nwith entrepreneurs, who have the potential to promote social change and development, fully\nrepresents the GABV bank’s investment strategy:\n“Entrepreneurs should feel that our bank is truly on their team, bringing all its\nexpertise to make their ideas work.”\nOver the years, Bristol Together has proven to be sustainable as a business model.\nNowadays, it is a self-financing project, which is not dependant on external support. The benefits\nof the initiative go beyond the immediate people they support. Bristol Together addresses wider\nsocietal issues around the UK’s housing shortage and the costs of reintegrating ex-offenders to\nthe society. For the GABV member, the success of Bristol Together reinforced their trust in the\nidea of finding opportunities to support small-scale projects, which often remain overlooked by\nthe conventional banks, and help them grow to deliver impact and social growth.\n\n6.4.3 Empowering\nSustainable banks encourage cooperation between their clients and other like-minded\ninstitutions and inspire them to develop sustainable business models. The GABV members take\neffort to help their clients achieve their financial goals and simultaneously develop their potential\nthrough educational and networking opportunities. The sustainable banking approach includes\nbuilding long-term partner relationships with clients to fulfil their potential and strengthen the\nlocal community of entrepreneurs. A GABV member from the U.S. shared how they work to\nempower people, especially those that were previously excluded from conventional financial\nservices, to achieve their full potential:\n“We have helped our client to continue their family tradition of growing food with\nrespect for the natural world and stewardship of the land.”\nSimilarly, a GreenSouth organisation from Peru explained that inspiring local\nentrepreneurs and small businesses to take appropriate risks and initiate partnerships is an\nimportant part of their community work and financial services provision:\n\n170\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\n“For us, support doesn’t stop after the initial loan, beyond this we aim to support\npeople ... through building up their capacities as businesspeople, watching them, as\nwell as their businesses grow. It is this relationship between the bank and the\nborrower that sets us apart from other financial institutions.”\nAnother GreenNorth bank from Denmark also agreed at the importance of empowering\nmembers of the community in which it is embedded:\n“We are always here for people whose ideals and values correspond well with what\nwe believe here. Our role is to ensure that the ... business is also economically\nsustainable... We support people who already believe in themselves to believe even\nmore.”\nA great example of such empowering identity work is a GABV bank from Denmark that\nhas been supporting an entrepreneur, who owns a farm and a farm shop for several years. Together\nwith his wife, the farmer sells vegetables, flour and meats produced on the farm, as well as\nproducts from other local organic manufacturers. Their target customers are young people and\nfamilies living in the urban areas of Denmark, who are starting to pay greater attention to the way\ntheir food is produced.\nFor the entrepreneurial couple, animal welfare and environmental impact are of great\nimportance. Their farm participates in the BERAS programme2 as an example of the Ecological\nRecycling Agriculture (ERA)3, which means that the farm operates on local and renewable\nresources with an integration of animal and crop production. This approach addresses an\nimportant issue of effective recycling of the nutrient-uptake in the fodder production. The issue\nis urgent as in Europe approximately 80% of the arable land is used for producing fodder. The\ninitiative supports farms along their ways of developing self-sufficient fodder production models,\nwhich could help limit animal density and contribute to a more even distribution of animals to\nfarms. The GABV bank’s co-worker commented:\n“In the case of this entrepreneur, his ideals and values corresponded very well with\nwhat we believe in here. Our role was to ensure that the organic business is also\neconomically sustainable.”\nThe GABV member has been a partner to the entrepreneur and his spouse since the very\nbeginning of their farm shops business. The bank granted them with their first loan in 1998.\nFarmers were looking for a bank that would be about more than just the money. The GABV\nbank’s co-workers offered them individual attention and have built a fairly close relationship\n2\n\nhttp://www.beras.eu/implementation/index.php/en/\nhttp://www.beras.eu/implementation/index.php/en/2012-02-09-21-53-40/ecologicalrecyclingagriculture-era\n3\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\n171\n\nbased on similar values and mutual interest in each other’s work. The GABV bank’s\nrepresentative described the relationship:\n“It is very fulfilling to work with clients like this one, because it makes me feel like\nI’m doing something positive for the society by providing financing. It is a pleasure\nto see that animals, nature and employees are treated well and with dignity at his\nfarm. And if my work can help projects like this grow, I am very satisfied.”\nThe GABV member further shared that they have a great network within their working\nfield, and they put substantial effort to link their clients to each other. For instance, if their client\nneeds help with their website or any other part of their small business, the bank would be in the\nposition to put them in contact with some of their other clients, who could provide such services\nor training. Such collaborative networking approach lays at the core of the bank’s sustainable\nbanking approach:\n“We show genuine interest in clients and their work. This will surely take more\ntime than what account officers in the conventional banks are willing or able to\nspend, but to us this is crucially important. This way we ensure the best possible\ncollaboration between our bank and the customers. Even more, we don’t really have\nsales objectives here. We focus on advising clients according to their current needs\nand their potential.”\n\n6.5 Chapter Summary\nThis chapter summarised insights from this study of sustainable finance and banking\norganisations, which demonstrate how they balance the challenges of the organisational identity\nplurality through identity work. Findings showed that a combination of critiquing, contextualising\nand intervening identity work tactics helps the GABV banks achieve an optimal balance between\nthe economic and the ethical approach to the role of the firm. Firstly, sustainable banks employ\n“critiquing” in order to understand how the sustainable banking differs from the conventional\nforms of financial services due to its simultaneous focus on the community development and the\nethical goals. It was discovered that he GABV banks approach “critiquing” of the conventional\nbanking by detecting its pitfalls and distancing their practices from the existing unsustainable\napproaches. Secondly, sustainable banks use “contextualising” to strengthen their links to the\ncommunities in which they are embedded, local traditions of baking and existing networks of\nsustainable organisations from different fields. In order to achieve those goals, the GABV banks\nengage into historicising, localising and cooperating identity work tactics. Finally, A sustainable\nbanks address their liabilities for multiple goals though the “intervening” identity work aimed at\nchanging the role of banking in society through the practices of including, initiating and\nempowering. Overall, it was discovered that these three sets of identity work tactics allow\n172\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\nsustainable banks to balance their pluralistic organisational identities and simultaneously perform\nthe economic and the ethical role in their communities.\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\n173\n\n174\n\nLIABILITIES FOR MULTIPLE GOALS\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\nSustainable Banking: Identity and Liabilities\n\n7.1 Introduction\nIn addition to the liabilities for multiple goals discussed in the previous chapter,\nsustainable banks also face liabilities to multiple principle stakeholder groups. Data analysis\nfrom this research revealed that sustainable banks as pluralistic identity organisations guided\nby the community development and the financial goals adopt the relational stakeholder\norientation. Consistent with Brickson (2005), the same stakeholder orientation persists across\nthe GABV members, as well as their various stakeholder groups. It was further identified that\nthe relational approach of sustainable banks to stakeholder relations consists of six elements:\nsufficient participation and inclusion of affected communities; full incorporation of local\nneeds; philanthropic inclusiveness; transparency and power balance among stakeholders;\ngovernmental commitments; and collaborative hiring and socialisation. This chapter explains\nevery element of the relational identity orientation adopted by the GABV banks in detail and\nprovides empirical examples from the data.\nThe following sections outline how the GABV banks build relationships with their\nmultiple principle stakeholders. Data analysis revealed that the relational identity orientation\nis expressed by the GABV banks through a combination of activities. First, sustainable banks\ntend to ensure wide but selective inclusion of the local communities affected by their\ncommercial activities based on the particular needs their projects aim to satisfy. These might\nrange from sustainable housing and renewable energy to supporting the development of\nfemale entrepreneurs and increasing the inclusiveness towards disabled people. Second,\nthrough building durable relationships with their selected partners, the GABV banks develop\nsuperior approach to discovering, prioritising and addressing the needs of the communities in\nwhich they are embedded. The GABV members put considerable effort in involving their\ncommunities in organisational governance, collecting feedback and building two-way\ncommunication streams. Third, sustainable banks apply the relational approach to their\nphilanthropic initiatives, where they aim to provide durable support to the selected causes. The\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\n175\n\nGABV banks restrain from donating to unrelated community issues, no matter how urgent,\nand avoid organising one-time campaigns. Fourth, the GABV banks develop innovative\napproaches to sustaining the power balance among their stakeholders and ensuring\ntransparency and accountability towards their partners. Based on the challenges discussed in\nthe previous chapters, this requires substantial innovativeness from sustainable banks as the\npioneer pluralistic identity organisations. Fifth, the GABV banks practice relational attitudes\nin their governmental relations by complementing governmental efforts and commitments\nwithout replacing them. Sustainable banks work together with local authorities to make their\ncommunities stronger, more inclusive and resilient, and their relational approach strengthens\nthe collaborations with state actors. Finally, the GABV banks practice a collaborative\napproach to hiring and socialisation and aim to build similar partner relations with their coworkers. Employees are perceived as the highest value by sustainable banks, who face the\nchallenges of recruiting people with financial backgrounds and strong support for the\ncommunity development agenda.\n\n7.2 Sufficient Participation and Inclusion of Affected Communities\nEven though participation, stakeholder dialogue and partnership could be found within\norganisations practicing any type of identity orientation, the relational organisations stand out\nby ensuring wide and simultaneously selective inclusion of the local communities directly\naffected or concerned by their operations. Large number of the GreenNorth banks are\ncommunity owned, which predetermines active involvement with the members and issues that\nhave the most significance for the local population. A respondent from France shared:\n“As a cooperative bank, our capital is held by its customers, which take part\nin the bank’s activity and strategy.”\nOther GABV banks also demonstrate strategic approach to selecting community\nissues in areas where they possess the most expertise, resources and potential for creating\ncommunity benefit. Problems addressed by the Green North banks vary from agricultural\nneeds and small business development to environmental protection, rights equality and\ninnovation. A GABV member from U.S. describe their approach to working with the local\ncommunity as follows:\n“We invest our time and resources in the neighbourhoods where we have\nbranches. We approach marketing at a micro community level, focusing on\nthe neighbourhoods surrounding our branches.”\n\n176\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\nThe approach of the GABV banks to community engagement is well illustrated by a\nbank from Europe, which worked with the Messina Community Foundation, aimed at\nsupporting vulnerable individuals by providing them with access to training in traditional local\nskills and craftsmanship. This social enterprise employs and reintegrates into society former\ninmates from a local psychiatric prison hospital. All profits from its operations the Messina\nCommunity Foundation reinvests in social and cultural projects within the local community.\nCommunity efforts of the organisation have been acknowledged by the OECD, UNOPS and\nWHO, who saw great innovation and value in its model of enhancing the community welfare\nthrough personal development. The GABV bank’s representative described the Foundation in\nthe following words:\n“The Messina Community Foundation gives hope to people who have lived\nbelow the poverty line for many years, but who still believe in changing their\nlives. It makes people believe that with commitment and hard work they will be\nable to change their lives and get financial freedom.”\nThe Messina Community Foundation is located in an under-developed rural area of\nSouthern Italy, where a gap between rich and poor is tremendous and where civil society faces\nthe challenges of organised crime and extortion. Its branches occupy artistic and natural sites\nreclaimed from the Italian mafia. Inspired by its background, the organisation and its partners\naim to battle crime in all its forms. They practice full transparency of operations through\nreporting, peer monitoring and whistle blowing. The Foundation runs on a self-sustaining\nmodel without relying on support from the government or donation agencies:\n“Community foundations are deeply embedded in their communities and have\ndirect contact with their members. They are in a unique position to flexibly\nrespond to what is happening in their immediate environment.”\nThe Messina Community Foundation is involved in multiple social and environmental\ninitiatives. One of these initiatives is located on the land owned by the Ministry for Justice\noutside the local psychiatric prison hospital. Plants, flowers, fruit and vegetables are grown\nand sold there via cooperative buying groups collectively promoted by the Slow Food\nMovement. The organisation also works on several cultural projects for the Strait of Messina\nincluding music festivals, literature fairs and music performances for children in the city:\n“Community foundations help locally emerging ideas take shape. They can then\ncreate opportunities for people of different backgrounds and work together\naround points of common interest.”\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\n177\n\nThe GABV bank considers itself fully aligned with the values and mission of the\nMessina Community Foundation. They have been financial partners since the start of the\ninitiative. The bank provides daily financial services and assists with fundraising. It also\nsupported the Foundation with a loan to finance the purchase of solar panels for its facilities\nand to assist with their social and cultural initiatives.\nGreenSouth banks often devote their community development efforts to summering\nlocal entrepreneurs through micro-finance programs. This is how a bank from Bolivia\ndescribes their efforts in ensuring sufficient inclusion of the affected communities:\n“Our purpose is to contribute to the development and quality of life of micro\nentrepreneurs and salaried workers, through financial products and services\nspecifically adapted to their needs.”\nA bank from Paraguay further explains how they engage with the local community\nand which opportunities they offer to people within the regions of their operation:\n“We are committed to contributing in a positive manner to economic\ndevelopment, the generation of job opportunities, employment and wealth\ntowards poverty relief by offering sustainable solutions designed to provide\nproper responses to the majority of people, entrepreneurs, families,\nenterprises, organisations and communities in each market and region of the\ncountry.”\nAnother good example of the GABV banks’ community work approach, is a member\nbank, which responded to local needs unaddressed by conventional banks through supporting\na Groupe SOS program. The local initiative consists of three units responding to the most\nstriking community problems. SOS Drogue International is aimed at tackling drug addiction\nand developing programmes against drug abuse. SOS Habitat et Soins works on the growing\nHIV epidemic. Finally, SOS Insertion et Alternatives addresses the problems of social\nexclusion. Together the three organisations are united under the Groupe SOS umbrella to\nrepresent a complex care offer to support people and prevent social exclusion. Groupe SOS\nconsists of 44 branches operating across France, la Réunion, Guyane and Mayotte. This is how\nthe GAB bank’s representative described their relationship with the organisation:\n“Our core business fundamentally differentiates us from other banks. We are\ntruly aware of the concern our customers have. Each of us benefits from the\nknowledge of the other. We know the issues Groupe SOS faces and they know\nthe limitations we currently have as a bank.”\nGroupe SOS offers integrated support to people in economically or socially troubling\nsituations. It targets the supply of fundamental needs to the community, such as housing,\n\n178\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\nhealthcare, education, employment and elderly care. Today, 44 local branches of the\norganisation employ 10,000 people and manage over 300 facilities including hospitals,\nnurseries, retirement homes, educational institutions, social housing and integration facilities\nfor disabled people:\n“Organisations supported by their communities can enable innovation,\nempowerment and learning to take place. It is the affected community that\nneeds to have voice.”\nFinancial resilience of the Groupe SOS is enabled by its efficient management\nstrategy. A special shared-services division within the organisation provides management\nservices such as human resources, accounting, communication, fundraising, law, finance and\nmarketing across the whole group. The organisation also contributes to growing fellow social\nenterprises by sharing its knowledge and expertise. The GABV bank’s representative\ncommented on her experience working with the Groupe SOS:\n“We share common values with the Groupe SOS. We all believe in\ntransparency, solidarity, respect and commitment to better communities.”\nThe GABV bank has supported large-scale projects of the Groupe SOS, as well as\nsmaller initiatives of the group. Stepping from its deep understanding of the issues facing\nsocial enterprises, the bank was able to support them timely and efficiently. My interviewee\nshared that she found it very gratifying to support a client like the Groupe SOS, which is a\nmajor player in local social economy.\n\n7.3 Full Incorporation of Local Needs\nThe existing literature has long reported on the problematic nature of thorough\nstakeholder consultation processes. As a result, organisational efforts often are not targeted\ntowards the needs of local communities. They also often fail to address the issues for which\norganisations are responsible and the stakeholders to whom they are accountable. The failure\nor inability of organisations to incorporate and prioritise the needs of local communities has\nbeen considered as a major weakness of the stakeholder participation processes. On the\ncontrary, findings from this study indicate that the relational stakeholder orientation of\nsustainable banks empowers their superior approach to discovering, prioritising and\naddressing the needs of the communities in which they are embedded. GreenNorth banks\npossess sufficient expertise, resources and community support to focus on locally prioritised\nissues, which might differ from the spectrum of areas prioritised by conventional banks. Thus,\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\n179\n\na GABV member from Sweden has an explicit focus on social economy organisations, which\nthey identified as a priority after consultations with the local community representatives:\n“We aim to finance “social economy” organisations – non - profit\nassociations, mutual and cooperative companies.”\nAnother bank from U.S. uses different way of describing the areas that are the core of\ntheir approach. It specifies that the priority issues within their local community include rights\nequality and environmental protection:\n“We provide products, expertise and capital to a unique community of people\nwho share the same progressive values as we do regarding equal rights,\nwomen’s rights, workers’ rights, immigrant’s right and environmental\nprotections.”\nSimilarly, a GABV member from Canada chose to prioritise environmental issues as\na response to their community needs. People from Vermont (Canada) have been dealing with\ngrowing heating costs, which they consider one of the major financial burdens for the local\npopulation. Energy efficiency has become a priority for the state of Vermont, which set a goal\nto meet 90 percent of local energy needs through the renewable energy and increased\nefficiency by 2050. A local GABV bank has joined its community in working towards this\ngoal and has directed its efforts at providing affordable access to funding that would support\nenergy efficient homes, green transportation and renewable local energy sources:\n“I believe we have a unique role to play in initiating a credible, reliable,\nauthoritative conversation about what this community truly needs with the\npublic sector, other non-profit organisations, businesses and individual\ncitizens. And we are the only ones in that position, as far as I can see.”\nThe bank’s representative shared that, despite the state-wide energy goals and the\namount of efforts directed towards lowering the burden of high energy costs, only 20 percent\nof all the house energy audits that had been performed resulted in actual improvements. The\nmajority of local homeowners did not have sufficient financial resources to fix the problems\nidentified through the energy audit and to implement the suggested improvements. These\nfactors inspired the bank to develop VGreen – a program of flexible loans designed to enable\nenergy savings that benefit members of the local community, while supporting the state\nenvironmental goals. VGreen offers low-interest loans for projects or purchases that meet the\ncriteria of improving energy efficiency of a member’s house or means of transportation.\nVGreen loans are structured to make these investments cash flow neutral by offering\nfavourable terms, which allow borrowers to cover their loan payments using the money saved\n\n180\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\nthrough their energy improvements. As a result, the majority of program participants are able\nto make their loan payments with funds that were previously put toward their gas and\nelectricity bills:\n“Vermont had a need for an initiative like this one. Local clean energy sector\nincludes globally recognised companies in the green economy that research,\ndesign, construct and install wind, solar and hydroelectric systems.”\nThe initiative has received encouragement from the state of Vermont that has\nacknowledged the potential of innovative financing programs to incentivise the consumers to\ninvest in clean energy solutions. The state collaborated with the GABV bank on several energy\nefficiency initiatives through state-funded grants that have collectively enabled over $400,000\nin interest savings for the community members. To date, VGreen has provided over 1,800\nloans totalling more than $30 million. With interest rates on these loans being approximately\nfive percent lower than the standard personal loan rate, the GABV member is empowering\nmore local community members to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy projects,\nsupporting the state of Vermont in meeting its ambitious energy efficiency goals:\n“It was truly driven by community demand and benefits local people the\nmost.”\nGreenSouth banks often prioritise problems of poverty reduction, women’s rights and\nequality in their work. A bank from Afghanistan shared the following approach to full\nincorporation of their community needs:\n“To reduce poverty, diminish the vulnerability of poor populations and\nalleviate economic and social exclusion, we help people become self-reliant\nand eventually gain the skills needed to graduate into mainstream financial\nmarkets.”\nSimilarly, a GABV member from Honduras explained that their areas of strategic\nfocus group around social and economic development of the local population and\nenvironmental protection:\n“We are a bank, specialised in satisfying the needs of the families of the\nHonduras popular economic sectors, actively promoting social development\nand the responsible use of the country’s natural resources.”\nAnother GABV bank from U.S. has supported local community by exclusively\naddressing their long-standing problem with real estate ownership and maintenance. It has\nbeen actively involved in supporting 148 members of the Colonial Estate Homeowners\nAssociation, which provides housing to people, whose age is 55 years plus. Bank’s formal\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\n181\n\ninvolvement began in 2016, when it provided $11 million of funds in partnership with the\nnational non-profit organisation ROC USA and an insurance company MetLife. Together they\nfinanced the purchase of land beneath the community homes by their owners:\n“Our intention is to promote convenience, quiet enjoyment, safety and welfare\nof the residents in this community. We help local people preserve and enhance\nthe quality of life in the community.”\nColonial Estates was the third project that the GABV member, ROC USA and\nMetLife undertook together to finance resident-owned manufactured home communities.\nWith their help the Colonial Estates, which since then has been operating as a cooperative,\nprovides its resident-owners, most of whom are retirees, with higher social security. One of\nthe employees involved in the project commented:\n“It’s not only about owning the property for people but about protecting their\nfuture. We work to make sure that people can pay their bills. We don’t make\nmoney as a typical investor would.”\nPreviously the land and the property were owned and managed by the outsiders.\nResidents used to face problems with property maintenance and worry about its rising costs.\nNonetheless, when an opportunity to buy out the property first arose, community members\nwere hesitant. The GABV bank’s co-worker explained that residents shared concerned about\nthe prices of land and monthly mortgage payments. That time the community voted against\npurchasing the property. However, when the second chance appeared two years later, the\nColonial Estates residents took a different approach. Earlier the same year, Oak Hill Taunton,\na similar manufactured home park across the street, had become resident-owned with the help\nfrom the GABV bank and its partners. Their successful property acquisition influenced the\nColonial Estates residents and inspired them to take action:\n“It makes everyone involved proud that this project truly addresses local needs,\nurgent ones... People feel lucky that their neighbours are also their friends.”\nWorking with the GABV bank, the Colonial Estates residents formed their own\ncooperative and collectively bought out the land from the previous owner. The new\nhomeowners are now determined to further develop their neighbourhood, while controlling\nmonthly housing costs in a local market with rapidly escalating rent prices. The GABV bank’s\nco-worker shared:\n“Our expertise in cooperative housing and our mission of supporting\ncommunities has truly helped the Colonial Estates residents. It has made them\nhomeowners and it has changed their lives.”\n\n182\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\nThe bank supported the community with fixed-rate, long-term financing to enable the\nlow- and moderate-income retirees to take control of their neighbourhood. They facilitated the\ncommunity improvements and empowered people to prosper.\n7.4 Philanthropic Inclusiveness\nPrevious research suggested that even though organisational initiatives like building\nschools, clinics and community centres, provision of recreational activities and similar\ninfrastructural projects are often characterised as community development efforts, a large\nshare of them is underscored by philanthropic motivations (Visser, 2008). As opposed to longterm sustainable activities that guarantee the well-being of beneficiaries, philanthropy usually\nconsists of short-term handouts issued by an organisation that possesses the absolute discretion\nto choose who shall benefit from them. The few who do benefit are then portrayed as\nrepresentative of the entire population affected by an organisation’s work. This phenomenon\nhas been referred to as the “philanthropic selectivism” or tokenism (Imbun et al., 2015).\nAccording to the findings from this research, sustainable banks, on the contrary,\npractice similar relational approach to their philanthropic initiatives as they do in their core\nactivities. GreenSouth banks usually offer philanthropic programs along the lines of their main\ndevelopmental focus. They find such initiatives equally important to their main banking\nactivities, as noted by a GABV bank from Malaysia:\n“We believe in giving back to the society and we are committed to enhancing\nthe living standard of those around us through programs and engagements that\ngo beyond profit orientation.”\nMoreover, philanthropic initiatives of the GABV banks fully reflect their relational\nidentity orientations in their long-term sustainable nature. Thus, a charitable initiative of a\nGABV bank from Malaysia, Wakaf Selangor Muamalat, has accumulated approximately RM\n19.3 million (£3.7 million) through the local branches. Around 37 percent of the fund have\nbeen directed towards developing local education and healthcare sectors, while the remaining\nmoney has been reinvested to generate further returns. Investments in education include\ndonations for school constructing projects, vans and projectors purchases. Health care support\nis devoted to mobile clinics, dialysis machines, nitrogen storage tanks and similar expensive\nmedical equipment:\n“Our community philanthropy has a distinctive role in helping address\nchallenges posed by poverty and exclusion in local communities. We are in a\nrelatively unique position to have the ability to shape responses and apply our\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\n183\n\nresources in ways to challenge these issues without politics that restrict local\nand national government responses.”\nMobile clinics initiative, which provides free medical services to the local population,\nhas been one of the main projects under the GABV bank’s charitable program. To date, three\nmobile clinics have been launched in collaboration with the local hospitals, who agreed to\nprovide free treatment to their patients. Each mobile clinic functions at a pre-determined\nlocation and occasionally visits surrounding areas. The clinics offer limited variety of\ntreatments, such as blood pressure examinations, diabetes, vision and physical check-ups and\nconsultation services. Mobile clinics also have regularly participated in the mobilisation to\noffer health care services in states that were hit by the seasonal floods. Overall, the mobile\nclinics charitable project has benefited more than 5,000 patients in Malaysia. The GABV bank\nis planning to keep expanding the number of clinics in the future:\n“Community philanthropy is about more than money and brings local\nknowledge, people and expertise to the table. It should be courageous in its\nresponses as it is at the frontline of building communities.”\nGreenNorth also strictly link their philanthropic initiatives to their corporate missions.\nTheir projects benefit from a long-term approach and a strong focus on selected number of\npriority areas that they consider the most relevant for the communities in which they are\nembedded. A bank from the UK commented:\n“We are an ethical savings and loans bank with a mission to use money for\ngood. Our philanthropic projects support a wide range of organisations across\nthe arts, community, education, environment, faith, health, housing,\nregeneration, social care and sports.”\nAnother GABV member from Canada was similarly clear in defining the spectrum\nand mission of their philanthropic efforts:\n“Over the years, we have become the social movements, collective\nenterprises, and committed citizens’ financial institution. We develop our\nprograms in consultation with a wide range of organisations and design our\ninitiatives based on their special needs.”\nOne prominent example, a GABV bank from Russia, has developed multiple social\nand educational projects aimed to raise awareness of the importance of quality education and\nto increase financial literacy of the local population. Their Financial Literacy Centre project\ncoordinates and promoted initiatives of local businesses and the academic community. The\nbank collaborated with regional universities to provide access to free advice and personal\nfinance education to the residents of the Southern Russia:\n\n184\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\n“Without local support and long-term commitment, community philanthropy\nprojects will continue to land like fireworks – flashing spectacularly and then\ndying.”\nThe first Financial Literacy Centre in Rostov on Don opened in 2014. Over the five\nyears, specialists of the centre have organised training for 2,500 participants from fifteen local\nuniversities. Volunteers and specialists of the centre have provided over 100,000 free of charge\nfinancial consultations. The most talented graduates of the program have been offered an\ninternship opportunity at the GABV Bank. A bank representative commented:\n“Our Centre offers a simple, straightforward and convenient opportunity for\nlocal people to develop basic financial literacy skills. Very importantly, this\nprogram is completely free of charge.”\nMore than 300 interns further have received permanent employment offers from the\nbank, becoming early career professionals. The consultations provided by the Financial\nLiteracy Centres address the needs of all population groups in the Southern Russia. Most\npopular topics include private wealth management, business planning basics, proper loans,\nonline banking, tax features and the basics of safe bankcard usage. They teach the community\nmembers to understand potential risks and gains of financial operations and investments and\nto make informed financial decisions. Bank’s representative reflected on this program:\n“Our Centre have made a strong contribution to promoting financial literacy\nin Russia, with its serious approach to working with local people and small\nbusinesses. This experience should be replicated.”\nMoreover, under this program the GABV bank offers special training for local\nentrepreneurs. Small business owners can obtain advice on taxation, finance and bookkeeping\nfrom the bank’s specialists with in-depth knowledge of these issues. The bank also regularly\nruns masterclasses for elders, teaching them how to pay bills from the comfort of their home,\nhow to use their bankcard to obtain their pension without having to queue and how to make\nsafe payments online.\n\n7.5 Transparency and Power Balance among Stakeholders\nOrganisational stakeholders often are characterised by varying and inconsistent\nambitions, needs and priorities. Yet, the viability of the relational identity orientation depends\non its reception by key stakeholders such as the community leaders, chiefs, NGOs, local\ngovernment representatives and ordinary community members. Findings from this study\nsuggest that to ensure the sustainability of their projects and to fulfil their community\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\n185\n\ndevelopment missions, sustainable banks create innovative and transparent approaches to\nlending and investing. They cooperate with members of their communities to ensure that their\nprocesses are trustworthy, ethical and reliable. Thus, a GreenNorth bank from France\ncommented:\n“Our purpose as an organisation and promise to our members, employees and\ncommunities is built on cooperative values and principles and full\ntransparency.”\nA bank from Norway agreed that transparency lays in the centre of their operations,\nand so is the power balance among stakeholders:\n“We emphasise building alliances between depositors and lenders, and we\npractice transparency as a carrying principle. We strive to offer high quality,\nsolid banking services to all our clients regardless of the size of their deposits\nor credit needs.”\nOne example of the practical implementation of this principle is La Siembra – a\ncooperative organisation that sells fair trade organic Camino products including coffee, cocoa\nand sugar, which is financed by a GABV bank from Canada. The cooperative needed help in\nimproving its financial structure to remain resilient in the face of exchange rate disparities and\nto meet other challenges typical for this type of business, such as seasonality issues,\ndistribution and purchasing logistics. The GABV bank’s representative explained their active\ninvolvement with the cooperative:\n“We understand the importance of investing in fair trade cooperatives and have\nbeen a key player in developing this co-op.”\nWith the support from the GABV bank, La Siembra was able to substantially cut its\noperating costs. The cooperative previously dealt with three foreign partners: Pronatec AG\n(main chocolate supplier), Equal Exchange (an American fair trade and organic food\ncooperative) and Shared Interest (their main financial partner). Financial transactions had been\nnegotiated using British pounds and American dollars. Nowadays, the GABV bank is taking\ncare of the exchange rates and secures the best transactions for La Siembra, which has never\nhad access to such services before due to its lack of scale. The GABV bank’s policy of small\nbusiness inclusion has opened up new opportunities for the cooperative and has empowered it\nto compete with large multinational corporations like an equal:\n“We think it’s important to invest in local community-based businesses. They\nare the choice that local customers deserve, and they are what local\n\n186\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\ncommunity need to prosper. Very often they are the heart and soul of diversity\nand inclusion in small communities”.\nGreenSouth banks pay even stronger attention to open up opportunities to individuals\nand organisations that were previously neglected by conventional banks. They innovate to\noffer these clients alternative guarantee systems, collective credit products and inclusive\nscreening options. A GABV bank from Colombia expanded:\n“We see ourselves as an inclusive, sustainable, environmentally and socially\nresponsible financial institution supporting local micro-entrepreneurs and\nmicro-businesses with our committed, competent and innovative staff. we\nwork to generate opportunities for local development and progress, and to\nimprove life quality of Colombian micro-entrepreneurs and their families.”\nAnother GABV bank from Central America with similar values and approach started\na quality micro health insurance program in cooperation with an insurance sector leader to\nextend access to insurance products to a large number of its clients. The service gives clients\naccess to two doctor visits, clinical examination, medicine purchase and hospitalisation. It has\nas affiliated partners an extensive network of private physicians, clinical laboratories,\npharmacies and hospitals, as well as life insurance for funeral expenses. Bank representative\nexplained:\n“Putting the financial side and the insurance side together was not easy task,\nbut we are willing to work on it.”\nSince the bank purchased a portfolio of 23,000 customers (with credit balances under\n$ 1,000.00), totalling $ 8.2 million, from another financial institution, it has transformed it into\nthe largest micro-finance institution in the region. This portfolio transfer also emphasised the\nGABV bank’s commitment to local people and their needs. It has further collaborated with\nthe International Finance Corporation (IFC) to attract U.S. $8 million financial support to\nexpand its services to 25,000 new customers:\n“This program plays an important role in the development of local\ncommunities. It brings great benefits for rural poor households.”\nWhile many of the GreenSouth banks work to provide their clients with equal excess\nto innovative micro-finance and micro-insurance programs, some GreenNorth banks face\nchallenges of the rising costs of space within modern urban cities. Thus, in German cities it is\ngetting increasingly hard for residents to find affordable accommodation due to the limited\noffer and rising housing prices. It has become even more challenging to maintain spaces for\ncost sensitive fields such as art and culture. A GABV bank from Germany funded a new space\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\n187\n\nfor art and culture in Berlin called Holzmarkt. This urban village offers affordable space for\ncreative industry workers, such as studios for circus acrobats and musicians, a children’s\ntheatre, rehearsal rooms and an event hall fitting up to 300 guests. The Holzmarkt also covers\nvarious other aspects of the city life with its restaurant, club, hairdresser, organic food store\nand bakery. The GABV bank supported the project based on their commitment to financing\ngreen construction and green housing:\n“The interest rates on our loans depend on the ecological quality of a project,\nsuch as energy savings, use of sustainable building materials, deployment of\nreusable energy sources, etc.”\nThe project is based on the idea of diversity, which is visible in its every building with\na unique artistic style. The village was built from environmentally friendly materials, such as\nrecycled windows, second-hand bricks and scrap wood from the region. No house in\nHolzmarkt resembles the other, making the whole village a piece of art itself. It also marks a\ncontrast to the luxury apartments, hotels and offices that are typically situated along the river\nSpree. The GABV bank helped fund this cooperative project, where economy, ecology and\nculture are tantamount. Its involvement has made it possible to secure this expensive property\nfor the needs of the larger community. It was possible due to the bank’s strong stance on\ntransparency and power balance among its stakeholders:\n“We have an environmental board, which is an independent controlling body\norganised in a similar way to a supervisory board. We adhere to a set of\npositive criteria as well as exclusions, and we are fully transparent about it.”\n\n7.6 Governmental Commitments\nMichael (2003: 126) claimed that the community development discourse appears to\n“signal a new form of cooperation between government, business and civil society in the\npromotion of social objectives.” Blowfield and Murray (2014: 145) further suggested that the\nexperience of active organisational involvement with the communities in which they operate\nindicates that the “development ends can best be served when there is genuine collaboration\nwhereby different sectors pursue shared or complementary poverty objectives”. The idea of\n“shared” community development goals has fuelled the discourse of corporate activism and\ncorporate citizenship. Nonetheless, existing research has indicated that, although collaboration\nand partnership between governments and organisations may facilitate the community\ndevelopment, it poses the risk of governments exploiting organisational efforts and avoiding\ntheir developmental responsibilities.\n\n188\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\nFindings from this research on the GABV banks show that community development\nactivities led by the relational identity orientation may complement governmental efforts and\ncommitments without superseding or replacing them. Sustainable banks work together with\nthe local authorities and non-governmental initiatives to effectively and timely complement\ntheir services and duties. GreenNorth bank from Japan shared their experience:\n“We actively establish partnerships among 31 Japanese local financial\ninstitutions, as well as 6 governmental agencies, which share awareness of\ncommon issues and inter-exchange information for economic development\nprojects in the region.”\nAnother bank from the U.S. pointed to similar approach taken in their relations with\nlocal and state governments and governmental agencies:\n“We wish to demonstrate that our communities are viable markets if\napproached with business discipline and long-term commitment. We often\ncooperate with the local government to achieve sufficient lending and\ninvestment volume to affect overall market dynamics in the neighbourhoods\nwe serve.”\nA GABV bank from Germany that focuses on promoting sustainable banking to\nprotect the environment and to decrease carbon emissions, is a great example of successful\nand sustainable cooperation with the local authorities. In partnership with two governmental\nagencies, the bank has developed a “Stop Climate Change” certification for its customers. The\ncertification program requires a four-stage process, which consists of analysing the customer’s\ncurrent carbon emissions performance, developing and implementing a strategy to improve it\nand offsetting unavoidable carbon emissions through investments in environmentally friendly\nprojects. Individual customers also have access to the certification, such as an enhanced\nversion of the carbon emissions calculator, which helps accounting for one’s personal climate\nfootprint, learning about opportunities to diminish it and taking a set of steps to balance it. The\nbank commented:\n“Cooperation with the local government was a powerful, practical example of\naction the banks can take to contribute to efforts to address the climate crisis.”\nAnother GABV bank from Canada collaborated with a local university to develop\ninnovations in yet another area – peace restoration. They created a Centre for Peace\nAdvancement (CPA), which started hosting a wide cohort of peace scholars, professionals\nfrom peace building organisations and peace-related non-profit and state initiatives. The\nCentre provides opportunities for research, training, public engagement and other forms of\ncollaboration, therefore, promoting far-reaching and innovative insights and solutions for\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\n189\n\npeace missions locally and globally. An interviewee from the GABV bank shared his\nenthusiasm about the cooperative work with state institutions on developing innovative\napproaches to peace:\n“The CPA is an innovative expression of our core values. Our credit union is\ncommitted to sharing resources to support the building of peaceful and\nprosperous communities.”\nIn its Peace Incubator situated on 450 square feet of shared space, the GABV bank\nand its partners host members working on peace-related initiatives at different stages of\ndevelopment. Community members and program students receive mentorship, training and\nseed funding to advance and promote their work. In the first three years of the initiative,\nsixteen peace start-ups have been grown, covering various community issues from peace\neducation in schools to landmines defuse in Cambodia and other conflict zones. The GABV\nbank is actively involved in the operation of the Centre providing financial support and\nexpertise. The work of CPA has already reached the lives of over 10,000 local community\nmembers through their school workshops, public events and exhibitions:\n“Our ongoing partnerships have been crucial for our efforts to advance\ninnovative understandings and practices of peace locally and globally.”\nGreenSouth also confirmed that partnering with the local government is an important\npart of their daily work. In their context of operation, it is particularly crucial to be able to\nunite community development efforts without superseding local authorities. A bank from\nBangladesh expanded:\n“In our work, focused on market and business with growth potential, we assist\nthe government in building a just, enlightened, healthy, democratic and\npoverty-free Bangladesh.”\nAnother community focused bank from Dominican Republic further added:\n“We work together with local authorities to provide solutions to productive\nsectors and to Dominican families. We can help each other a lot. And we do.”\nOne of the GABV banks from Palestine, where youth unemployment reaches 50%\nand start-ups suffer from the lack of early stage financing, partnered with the government to\nprovide access to finance for aspiring entrepreneurs. The bank in cooperation with its partners\nlaunched a $10 million Ibtikar Fund aimed at supporting local early stage innovative ventures\nand enabling companies to grow and create returns to investors. The fund provides\nentrepreneurs with access to expertise from the experienced fund managers, information\n\n190\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\ntechnologies specialists and business mentors. The fund further supports its local community\nby creating employment opportunities for local young professionals and university graduates:\n“These investments are a validation of our work over the last two years, and a\nvote of confidence in our people and our partners.”\nIbtikar Fund fills a critical gap in the Palestinian entrepreneurial eco system. In\ncooperation with the existing accelerators and with the full support of the state, it trains\nentrepreneurs to build sustainable businesses and develop self-sustaining strategies avoiding\ndonor dependency. By ensuring access to the early stage seed funding, the GABV bank\nempowers local start-ups to move to further stages and compete locally and globally for angel\nand venture capital investments:\n“An important point that was discussed is around collaboration with different\nstakeholders, specifically local government. Independence is a key feature of\nour projects, and we raise funds from the community and do not accept funding\nfrom government or municipal sources. But we are exploring how we can\nharmonise our policy of independence with the recognition that collaboration\nbetween stakeholders is very important.”\nAnother successful example was found at a GABV bank from Nigeria, a country with\nvibrant young population, a considerable number of which suffers from restricted access to\neducational opportunities limited by lack of available scholarships and state bursaries. To\nsupport the community in addressing this issue, local GABV bank has introduced a\nprogramme aimed at helping young people improve their financial and life situations, while\ncontinuing to pursue their education. The programme named Skills Acquisition Scheme allows\nparticipants to learn a craft of their choice. The training is available in the areas of information\nand computer technologies, fashion design, hairdressing, cosmetology, catering, event\nmanagement, interior decoration, plumbing and other crafts. On top of it, the scheme provides\nthem with access to training in entrepreneurship and encourages them to become business\nowners and create jobs for local population. Participants are required to make a number of\ncommitments, including staying in the programme for at least six months. They also need to\nbe active members of the scheme training for a period longer than six months to become\neligible for start-up and consumer loans from the GABV bank:\n“We are giving local people a steppingstone to move on. The economy of this\ncountry relies on small scale businesses to grow. We can improve lives together\nand these matters.”\nThe programme was developed in close cooperation with the Nigerian Directorate of\nEmployment (NDE) and National Business and Technical Examinations Board (NABTEB),\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\n191\n\nwhich ensure formal certification for the graduates of training programs. Skills Acquisition\nScheme has proven to be an effective initiative of Nigerian state and the GABV bank in\nenhancing the financial independence of young population. The bank’s representative shared\nthat they highly value this partnership and consider it to have profound social impact in the\ncommunities they serve:\n“It is imperative for us that we give young people opportunity to move on\nbecause local economic growth depends on small and medium business. We are\ninterested in getting these people out of the streets and empowering them to\nachieve their potential.”\n\n7.7 Collaborative Hiring and Socialising\nFindings from the GABV show that the relational organisations offer psychological\ncontracts that emphasise a dyadic bond between the organisation and each employee\n(Morrison & Robinson, 1997) promising to attend to employees’ needs and expecting similar\ninclusiveness from them (De Meuse, Bergmann, & Lester, 2001). A psychological contract\nrefers to employees’ understanding of an organisation’s perceived promises about its\nobligations towards the employees and expectations from them (Levinson, Price, Munden,\nMandl, & Solley, 1962; Morrison & Robinson, 1997). The contract describes the relationships\nbetween employees and the organisation itself rather than individual organisational agents\nwithin it. Relational psychological contract promises employees a common bond with others\nworking towards similar community development goals and collective contribution to the\nbigger purpose. Thus, a bank from the UK shared:\n“Our mutuality is at the heart of our work. We believe that co-operative\nrelations with our co-workers are a better way to create a sustainable financial\norganisation, which will be able to help the local community flourish.”\nAnother GABV member from Germany further commented on their employee\nrelations:\n“Our social commitments also include our own people. We make sure that\ntheir emotional and mental needs are the focus of our activities.”\nA bank from Australia also added:\n“We pride ourselves on putting our members first and as a result we have one\nof the highest levels of member satisfaction in Australian banking.”\nAnother great example of such approach is a GABV bank from Switzerland, which\nsupports Hotel Marta, an organisation founded to provide employment for women with\n\n192\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\nlearning difficulties and mental health issues. The bank feels connected to the organisation’s\naims and was able to create an appropriately tailored finance package:\n“Hotel Marta is fairly typical of the type of social enterprise that we support\nwith favourable lending terms. We channel money from investors, and only they\ndecide the cause their money will finance.”\nThe founders of the hotel trace their roots to a centre for women founded after the\nFirst World War, which was working towards relieving hunger and hardship. Nowadays, the\nHotel engages primarily with issues of the social policy and supports the interests of women\nat work, in education and within the family setting. Management attributes the success of the\norganisation to the cooperation of the person who owns the property. She shared the vision of\nthe founders and joined the project at an early stage:\n“We also set ourselves equal opportunity goals and combine them with\ntransparent payment and promotion of part-time work and job share.”\nThe hotel is run on a profitable financial model to secure the long-term resilience of\nthe business and the jobs it provides to local women. Hotel Marta offers ten part-time positions\nfor women with learning disabilities. The women receive an opportunity to hold a permanent\njob and simultaneously undergo training to be empowered to return to the labour market as\nfully qualified participants. The GABV bank has developed financial solution that allowed\nHotel Marta to increase financial support through direct investments of lower-cost capital in\nthe form of trust loans. Such an innovative approach also allowed creating a unique bond\nbetween money providers and borrowers with the common goal of offering empowering\nemployment to excluded categories of market participants:\n“We have high share of female customers. It seems that our values appeal more\npowerfully to women.”\nThe women employed at the Hotel Marta previously lived on the margins of society.\nWith the help of the GABV bank, they have been given a chance to build the future everyone\ndeserves. One of the GABV bank’s co-workers shared that on her multiple venue visits she\nwas truly impressed by the hard work and dedication that women employed at the Hotel Marta\nshow beyond their disabilities. By supporting organisations like Hotel Marta, the GABV bank\nfulfils its part of the psychological contact with its members, who are eager for supporting the\ncommunity in which they operate and implementing ambitious social and ecological projects\nlocally in cooperation with the community itself.\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\n193\n\nOther GreenSouth banks also made multiple comments on their strong commitment\nto collaborative hiring and socialising. Thus, a GABV member from Malaysia explained:\n“Our employees are our biggest asset. We value each employee’s unique\ncontribution to the growth of the bank by creating a rewarding and healthy\nworking environment in supporting both their professional as well as personal\nlives.”\nAnother bank from Bangladesh confirmed:\n“Our mission is to keep a diverse, far flung team fully motivated and driven\ntowards materialising the bank’s vision into reality.”\n\n7.8 Chapter Summary\nThis chapter explained how sustainable banks, members of the GABV, address their\nliabilities to multiple principle stakeholders presented by their pluralistic organisational\nidentity. Findings from this research suggest that sustainable banks adopt the relational\nstakeholder orientation in their relations with various stakeholder groups, which is evident\nfrom a combination of activities. Firstly, sustainable banks ensure wide but selective inclusion\nof the local communities guided by the common good needs their projects aim to fulfil.\nSecondly, sustainable banks effectively discover, prioritise and address the needs of the\ncommunities in which they are embedded through durable relations that they build with their\nselected partners. Thirdly, the GABV banks develop partnership based philanthropic\ninitiatives aimed at providing durable support to selected community good causes. Fourthly,\nsustainable banks ensure power balance among their stakeholders and practice transparency\nand accountability towards their partners. Fifthly, the GABV banks establish collaborative\nrelationship with their partners from local governments and complement state initiatives\nwithout replacing them. Finally, sustainable banks adopt collaborative hiring and socialisation\nand build partner relationships with their co-workers. Overall, a combination of these practices\nconstitutes a relational identity orientation, which help the GABV banks simultaneously\nperform the ethical and the economic roles in the communities where they are embedded.\n\n194\n\nLIABILITIES TO MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nDISCUSSION\nSustainable Banking: Identity and Liabilities\n\n8.1 Introduction\nOrganisational identity plurality leads to a diversity of perceptions on what are the\ncentral, enduring and distinct features of an organisation and what are its priority goals. In the\nprevious chapters, it was demonstrated that organisational identity plurality poses unique\nchallenges to the mission consistency within sustainable finance and banking organisations.\nAlthough the existing theories of the firm previously pointed to pluralistic identity\norganisations as promising vehicles for creation of both the community and the economic\nvalue (Sabeti, 2011), they also mentioned that these organisations face constant risk of a\nmission drift from the community welfare enhancement towards profit generation (Ebrahim\net al., 2014; Jones, 2007; Weisbrod, 2004). It should be mentioned that previous studies did\nnot exclusively attribute the risk of mission drift to pluralistic identity organisations, however,\nthey emphasised its particular urgency to such enterprises for two main reasons. Firstly,\norganisations pursuing dual missions are dependent on commercially generated revenues in\nfinancing and sustaining their operations. Therefore, the possibility of commercial activities\ngaining priority over the community development initiatives is increased. Secondly, these\norganisations are likely to have stronger negative consequences of the mission drift compared\nto conventional commercial organisations, where delivering community benefit to their\nbeneficiaries is not an essential part of the organisational mission.\nPluralistic identity organisations face a unique challenge of finding a working balance\nbetween the economic and the ethical roles and generating substantial revenues without losing\nsight of their community development purpose. Pluralistic identity organisations further\ncombine not only multiple divergent goals, but also interests of multiple stakeholder groups.\nPrevious research suggested that it is a function of the organisational identity to articulate both\nfor what an organisation is accountable and to whom it is accountable (Battilana & Dorado,\n2010; Glynn, 2000). This study of the GABV demonstrates that sustainable banks as pluralistic\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n195\n\nidentity organisations experience distinctive challenges associated with balancing the\neconomic and the ethical goals. It further explains how sustainable banks address the liabilities\nfor multiple goals, as well as the liabilities to multiple principle stakeholders stepping from\ntheir organisational identity plurality.\nSustainable banks face pluralistic organisational identity challenges that have not been\nappropriately addressed by the existing theories of the firm. This study shows that they\ncombine the economic and the ethical roles traditionally associated with the community\ndevelopment and the financial profitability goals. Consequently, they are bound to face\nchallenges in simultaneously addressing the demands of their capital providers (depositors),\nwho would be viewed as principal stakeholders under the economic role, and the needs of the\nbeneficiaries of their community development initiatives, who would be treated as principal\nstakeholders under the ethical role. Nonetheless, contrary to the findings from previous studies\n(Mersland & Strøm, 2010), it was discovered that sustainable banks from the GABV are able\nto combine the two roles over time without drifting away from their community benefit goals\ntowards financial gains. Findings from this research add important insights into the existing\nviews of the role of the firm and specifically the attempts to find a balance between the\neconomic and the ethical approach. Building on the hybrid identity organisation and the\nmultiple identities organisation theories, this thesis presents a case of pluralistic identity\norganisations that sustainably combine multiple goals without causing a mission drift.\n\n8.2 Pluralistic Identity Organisations Theory of Sustainable Banks\nPrevious attempts to synthesise the economic and the ethical approaches to the role of\nthe firm predominantly focused on the conflictual aspect of the organisational identity\nmultiplicity and excluded the possibility of organisations effectively combining the economic\nand the ethical goals without causing internal tensions. Findings from this research extend\nprevious debates on the role of the firm and suggest a synthesised approach based on the idea\nof the organisational identity plurality. It builds on the hybrid organisational identity theory\n(Albert & Adams, 2002; Ashforth & Reingen, 2014; Glynn, 2000; Pratt & Rafaeli, 1997) and\nmultiple organisational identities theory (Corley, 2004; Pratt & Foreman, 2000; Pratt &\nKraatz, 2009; Sillince & Brown, 2009) to show how identity work can be employed to develop\na coherent pluralistic identity and balance its economic and ethical aspects without causing an\nidentity conflict or a mission drift.\nIt should be noted that scholars within the multiple organisational identities theory\ndiscussed the possibility of the synergic relationship between dual organisational identities.\n\n196\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nNonetheless, little evidence has been provided on the means of achieving such synergy.\nMoreover, the multiple organisational identities approach treated dual identities as relatively\nindependent and did not provide evidence of these identities being hybridised to achieve dual\nmissions simultaneously. Therefore, this study extends both streams of research and provides\na compelling case for the pluralistic conceptualisation of the organisational identity, which\ndoes not strictly adhere to either the hybrid organisational identity or multiple organisational\nidentities theories, and advocates for combining their elements for a more accurate theorising.\nThe main characteristics of the sustainable banking identity are summarised in Table 13.\nTABLE 13. MAIN FEATURES OF THE SUSTAINABLE BANKING IDENTITY\nCONCEPTUALISATION\nSustainable banking identity\nNumber of identities\n\none hybridised identity\n\nRelationship among identities\n\ncomplementary\n\nLink to organisational design\n\nideographic structure\n\nConceptual focus\n\nhow organisational identities persist over time\n\nSource: Author (2019)\n\nPluralistic identity of sustainable banks helps them find a balance between the\neconomic and the ethical goals. Patvardhan et al. (2015) suggested that organisational identity\nserves to orient a collective understanding rather than anchor it. Process approach to\norganisational identity allows the GABV banks to achieve an “implicit consensus” (Nag et al.,\n2007) on sustainable banking identity, which might or might not lead to greater convergence\non shared meanings in time. The GABV members’ focus on coherence rather than consensus\nallows for greater latitude in interpretation of the sustainable banking identity. Such process\nthinking creates enabling conditions for the emergence of equifinal meanings and practices\nwithout imposing convergence on consensual identity of the Alliance members. In line with\nGioia and Chittipeddi (1991) and Fligstein (1997), who advocated for identity ambiguity as\nan enabling condition for cooperation, findings from this study prove that the process approach\nempowers organisations to effectively cooperate on implicit consensus without demanding\nexcess convergence among its members. Therefore, process approach to organisational\nidentity allows the GABV members to construct “a tent big enough to accommodate a range\nof entities with diverse meanings and practices, but with enough commonalities that members\nsee themselves (and have others see them) as belonging inside the tent” (Patvardhan et al.,\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n197\n\n2015). This finding is important for emerging collectives, which could benefit from a shared\nidentity as an encompassing element with multiple meanings and paths aimed at similar ends.\nAchieving coherence around a broader meaning of sustainable banking provides the basis for\ndeveloping a workable identity, which will suit a larger number of financial institutions all\nover the world.\nFindings from this study suggest that the GABV banks have been able to effectively\nreconcile the tensions between the economic and the ethical roles and address their liabilities\nfor multiple goals through a set of identity work tactics, which included critiquing,\ncontextualising and intervening. More specifically, these banks are involved in practicing\ndetecting the shortcomings of the conventional banking model; distancing themselves from\nthe unsustainable financial activities; historicising their banking approach in earlier practices\nof financial inclusion; localising their operations and adhering to the needs of local\ncommunities; cooperating with likeminded institutions within their sector and beyond;\nincluding groups of customers that have been previously excluded or underserved by\nconventional banking institutions; initiating change in the banking sector and empowering\ntheir customers to promote financial inclusion and community development. These identity\nwork tactics allow sustainable banks to simultaneously address the community development\nand the financial resilience goals without causing mission drift.\n\n8.3 Stakeholder Theory of Sustainable Banks\nIn addition to studying how sustainable banks perceive and manage their identity\nplurality, this thesis uncovered how they balance the economic and the ethical responsibilities\ntowards their multiple stakeholders. The research employed the organisational identity\norientation framework to analyse how the GABV members interact with different external\nconstituencies representing both the economic and the ethical identities (see Ch. 5 for\ntheoretical background overview). The synthesis of the stakeholder and the organisational\nidentity theories embodied in the framework incorporated previous stakeholder orientation\napproaches (Brickson, 2007; Clarkson, 1991; Jones et al., 2007). This study further extends\nthe existing identity theory of the firm, which was predominantly internally focused, and adds\nthe external perspective by exploring the role of organisational identity in stakeholder relations\nexpressed through the concept of organisational identity orientation.\nFindings from this research suggest that the relational identity orientation, which\nsustainable banks adopt in their stakeholder relations, remains consistent across diverse\nstakeholder groups. It was revealed that the relational stakeholder orientation of sustainable\n\n198\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nbanks consists of six interrelated elements: sufficient participation and inclusion of affected\ncommunities, full incorporation of local needs, philanthropic inclusiveness, transparency and\npower balance among stakeholders, governmental commitments and collaborative hiring and\nsocialisation. Sustainable banks ensure a wide but nonetheless selective inclusion of local\ncommunities directly affected or concerned by their operations. They put further efforts to\ndiscover, prioritise and address the needs of communities in which they are embedded. In\naddition, sustainable banks practice inclusiveness in their initiatives and ensure that their\nprojects are linked to long-term sustainable activities that lead to the well-being of\nbeneficiaries. They work to ensure high standards of transparency and accountability of their\nprojects. Furthermore, sustainable banks work with local governments on community\ndevelopment efforts and initiatives to effectively and timely complement their services and\nduties. Finally, they support the collaborative approach to hiring and socialisation to attract\nmembers committed to their aims and goals.\nPrevious studies suggested that organisations with the relational stakeholder\norientation are likely to build relationships based on cooperation and trust with selected\ncounterparts (Brickson, 2000). Findings from the present research confirm those claims and\npropose that stakeholder relations of sustainable banks are characterised by strong dyadic ties,\nwhere strength is reflected through frequency of interaction, reciprocity, emotional intensity\nand intimacy (Granovetter, 1977). Consistent with previous research (Brass et al., 1998), this\nstudy confirms that relational organisations treat their selected partners with empathy. The\nstated goals of stakeholder relations among sustainable banks are focused on supporting\npartner organisations and fostering their development and prosperity. Findings from this\nresearch further confirm that sustainable banks are organisations highly invested in the welfare\nof their stakeholders and members of the communities in which they are embedded.\nTo balance the ethical and the economic roles and avoid a mission drift, sustainable\nbanks face the task of aligning interests of their investors and borrowers. Within the\nconventional banks governed by the economic perspective on the role of the firm, market\nexchange processes facilitate the alignment of the two sets of goals. Value is created for\ninvestors, when borrowers consume financial services offered by the bank. Only when\nborrowers consume their services will investors receive financial benefits. Conventional banks\ncare to fulfil liabilities towards both the investors and the borrowers to avoid the risk of\nborrowers getting dissatisfied with the service and leaving for a competitor or investors\nwithdrawing their capital. Therefore, the market serves as a powerful mechanism for aligning\ninterests of the two principal stakeholder groups. Nonetheless, actors whose interests are not\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n199\n\nfulfilled through market mechanisms, such as local communities, NGOs or local authorities,\noften remain unattended under the economic approach to the role of the firm.\nThe ethical perspective, on the contrary, does not provide a mechanism of alignment\nsimilar to the market. In many instances, beneficiaries are heavily subsidised for the services\nthey receive from NGOs. The discrepancy between those who pay for services and those who\nreceive them creates potential misalignment of interests. The issue is further intensified in\nsettings, where funds are provided by multiple actors with diverse interests (Ebrahim, 2010).\nWithin the ethical perspective studies, such “multiple and competing audience pulls”\n(Lindenberg & Bryant, 2001: 218) have been referred to as creators of the multiple liabilities\ndisorder in organisations. The interests of funders are protected by the same mechanisms as\nthose of investors in organisations performing the economic role, where they can withdraw\ntheir funds should they find the performance unsatisfactory. Liabilities towards beneficiaries,\nhowever, appear to be the weaker link, despite organisations with the ethical standing serving\nthe mission of creating value for them. Where beneficiaries find services unsatisfactory, their\npower to refuse the service is limited (Cooke & Kothari, 2001), with few, if any, available\nalternatives. Not surprisingly, research on the ways to increase the power of beneficiaries in\nthe community development organisations has been gaining considerable traction within the\norganisational studies (Bonbright et al., 2009; Twersky et al., 2013). Nonetheless, the question\nof how to align the interests of the beneficiaries with those of the funders remains problematic\neven in the organisations that solely pursue the ethical role and more so in the pluralistic\nidentity organisations.\nFindings from this study show that in order to sustain their liabilities towards multiple\nprinciple stakeholders, the GABV banks adopt the relational identity orientation. They put\nemphasis on building durable partnerships with counterparts that align with their mission and\nvalues. In relations with their selected partners, sustainable banks monitor whether their\nactivities are reaching the right set of beneficiaries and whether their beneficiaries are provided\nwith a valid exit option (Ebrahim et al., 2014). A valid exit option becomes available to the\nbeneficiaries of GreenNorth and GreenSouth banks when particular group of beneficiaries\nconstitutes a significant part of the bank’s market so that their exit would substantially affect\nrevenues and when their activities are explicitly tied to serving the particular group of\nbeneficiaries. Even when the first of the conditions is fulfilled, beneficiaries may remain\ncaptive to the organisation in underserved markets due to the lack of meaningful alternatives.\nTherefore, fulfilment of the second condition becomes essential to restrain sustainable banks\nfrom putting financial goals above the wellbeing of their beneficiaries. Both GreenNorth and\n\n200\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nGreenSouth banks segment their markets in order to prioritise those beneficiaries, who they\nperceive as the most crucial to their community development mission. GreenSouth\norganisations usually do it in the form of geographical specialisation by limiting their\noperations to particular communities in rural and remote areas. GreenNorth banks often\nincorporate credit cooperative or building society form to achieve the higher levels of\nengagement with their beneficiaries and to better serve their well-being.\nThe relevance of the relational identity orientation for the GABV banks could be\nfurther explained based on the seminal distinction between Gemeinschaft (community) and\nGesellschaft (society), identified by Tönnies (1887). Communities differ from larger and more\nimpersonal forms of relationship such as society. As a result of living in the same geographic\nlocation, members of a community share some parts of their identity, expectations and\ninterests (Marquis & Battilana, 2009). This creates relative boundedness (Calhoun, 2001) and\nfacilitates the creation of symbiotic relationships between local organisations and the\ncommunity in which they are embedded. Jack and Anderson (2002) suggested that\nembeddedness allows organisations to become part of the local structure and to access as well\nas contribute to local resources and opportunities. The authors highlighted the importance of\nembedding as a means of “anchoring” the organisation in the local context. This allows them\naccess to knowledge regarding local needs, achieve greater credibility and tailor processes\nnecessary to carry out their activities.\nEmbeddedness in local communities enhances the ability of sustainable banks to\nempower local communities and facilitate development (Peredo & Chrisman, 2006).\nRelational stakeholder orientation of the GABV banks reflects their focus on embeddedness\nin communities in which they operate. It also allows for substantial differences in the strength\nand intensity of such embeddedness. Some banks, especially the ones that are member-owned\nin the form of credit cooperatives, rely on deep connections within the communities they\nrepresent and serve. Other GABV members prioritise partnerships that have broader social\nand geographical reach. Nonetheless, driven by their ethical role in society, they all practise\nthe relational approach, which allows for greater community focus than other types of\norganisational identity orientations (Brickson, 2008).\nRelational organisational identity orientation supports sustainable banks in fulfilling\ntheir liabilities to multiple principle stakeholders. This is consistent with earlier findings from\nBrickson (2000), who claimed that organisations that activate a relational identity orientation\nare better positioned to both minimise the disadvantages and maximise the advantages of\nstakeholder diversity. Greater commitment and empathy developed through the relational\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n201\n\napproach can reduce tensions and help organisations reach what Thomas and Ely (1996)\nnamed the “third paradigm of diversity management”. Organisations that reach this stage truly\nbenefit from diversity, because the context enables multiple groups of principle stakeholders\nto contribute to different perspectives and insights. The relational approach adopted by the\nGABV banks is characterised by greater openness to claims from multiple principle\nstakeholders. Even though the relational stakeholder orientation should not be expected to\nresolve all tensions in the process of managing diverse stakeholder claims in pluralistic\nidentity organisations, one could claim it provides organisations with a more effective\napproach to treating this diversity.\nIn the early nineteenth century, Mary Parker Follett suggested that organisations\nstruggling to integrate multiplicity and diversity should not count the number of conflicts but,\ninstead, their nature and the ways they are handled. When organisations acknowledge\nliabilities towards multiple stakeholder groups, accept diversity of perspectives and look for\nsolutions through the relational identity orientation, the banking on values promise is more\nlikely to be fulfilled.\n\n8.4 Chapter Summary\nA growing stream of research examines the conditions under which pluralistic identity\norganisations can sustain their mission duality over time (Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Ebrahim\net al., 2014; Pache & Santos, 2013). These studies have identified organisational features,\nprocesses and behaviours that support maintenance versus disruption of the organisational\nidentity plurality. Nonetheless, previous studies have not systematically examined the role of\norganisational identity in maintaining goals plurality (Mair et al., 2015). This research gap\nseems particularly urgent as organisational identity assumes a critical role in surfacing and\nreconciling potentially competing goals and expectations of divergent stakeholder groups\n(Ebrahim, 2010).\nThis thesis aimed to fill this gap by theorising about the pluralistic organisational\nidentity of sustainable banks, exploring the challenges they face in attending to multiple\ndemands and opportunities arising from the simultaneous pursuit of the economic and the\nethical goals. It was proposed that the role of organisational identity in avoiding mission drift\nand maintaining the hybridity involves the process approach to identity construction and\nmaintenance and relational identity orientation in stakeholder relations. It was further argued\nthat, in considering these two dimensions, it is necessary to distinguish between the liabilities\nfor multiple goals and liabilities to multiple principle stakeholders. The next chapter (Ch. 9)\n\n202\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nwill provide detailed summary of research contributions, managerial and policy implications,\nlimitations and future research directions.\nThis research shows that the pluralistic organisational identity approach allows\nsustainable banks to combine the economic and the ethical goals in a complementary,\nintegrated way. Moreover, this study shows that the sustainable banking identity persists over\ntime without intensifying internal tensions between the dual sets of goals and without causing\na mission drift. This focus is novel to the various pluralistic organisational identity debates\nthat have provided evidence for pluralistic identities being infused at the foundation of an\norganisation or being developed because of a traumatic event, such as a merger or downsizing,\nbut have not considered the possibility of pluralistic identities being consciously constructed\nby organisations through their identity work.\nThe process approach to their organisational identity work helps sustainable banks\nmaintain and express their individuality (Pickett & Brewer, 2001; Elsbach, 2003), yet also\nbelong to something greater than themselves (Ashforth & Reingen, 2014; Dutton, Dukerich,\n& Harquail, 1994), such as the GABV movement. Understanding the role of the process view\nof organisational identity is important for sustaining and growing the GABV movement. It\nhelps member organisations to avoid identity imbalance, over-identification with the Alliance\nand unhealthy comparisons with fellow members (Ashforth & Reingen, 2014). By adhering\nto the shared identity work practices, the GABV banks construct and maintain shared\nunderstandings of what constitutes a sustainable bank without losing their distinctiveness and\nindividuality.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n203\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nCONCLUSION\nSustainable Banking: Identity and Liabilities\n\n9.1 Introduction\nThis thesis set out to explore to what extent sustainable banks approach the identity\nplurality stepping from the simultaneous pursuit of the community development and the\nmarket profitability goals. It further aimed to explore which challenges and liabilities are posed\nby the combination of the economic and the ethical goals and how they could be resolved.\nDrawing from the existing theories of the firm, the researcher asked, “How do sustainable\nbanks perceive and resolve the challenges of organisational identity plurality?” Using the\nGABV as the empirical setting, challenges of the simultaneous pursuit of the economic and\nthe ethical role were explored and the attempt to synthesise the two views on the role of the\nfirm was made. The analysis consisted of three empirical chapters that employed qualitative\nresearch methods: Chapter 5 revealed how sustainable banks experience the identity plurality\nand discussed which associated challenges and liabilities they face, Chapter 6 introduced the\nidentity work tactics they employ to resolve their goals duality, and finally, Chapter 7\nexamined the identity orientation sustainable banks take towards their stakeholders. In this\nchapter, a summary of research findings is presented and their contribution to the current state\nof research on the role of the firm is discussed. The chapter concludes with a summary of\nmanagerial implications and policy implications of this thesis and provides suggestions for\nfuture research in this area.\n\n9.2 Research Summary\nThis thesis studied the phenomenon of sustainable banks as organisations that\nsimultaneously perform the economic and the ethical role. Featuring the Global Alliance for\nBanking on Values (GABV), it explored how these organisations combine the community\ndevelopment and the financial goals without causing a mission drift. Previous literature\nsuggested that firms, which combine the economic and the ethical goals experience the\n\n204\n\nCONCLUSION\n\norganisational identity plurality. The existing studies further claimed that pluralistic identity\norganisations face competing identity demands, which affect their organisational structures,\nprocesses and meanings and might cause a mission drift. However, little knowledge existed\non the ways organisations experience the identity plurality and the challenges and liabilities it\ncreates.\nFindings from this study demonstrated that sustainable banks experience identity\nplurality as a result of combining the ethical and the economic roles. These organisations\ndescribe themselves as simultaneously the economic and the ethical actors and acknowledge\nthat such identity duality creates a number of unique challenges and liabilities. It was found\nthat the GABV members perceive both the community development and the financial\nresilience goals as indispensable and demonstrate strong awareness of their organisational\nidentity plurality. Specifically, the study revealed that the organisational identity plurality\nposes regulatory, governance, stakeholders relations project assessment challenges to\nsustainable finance and banking organisations.\nThrough a qualitative case study of the GABV, this research further discovered that\nchallenges of identity plurality experienced by sustainable banks form two sets of liabilities,\nwhich should be resolved in order to combine the economic and the ethical roles: liabilities\nfor multiple goals and liabilities to multiple principle stakeholders. Findings suggested that\nsustainable banks resolve their liabilities for multiple goals through identity work, which\nincludes such tactics as critiquing, contextualising and intervening. Sustainable banks further\nsettle their liabilities to multiple principle stakeholders through the relational identity\norientation expressed through the inclusion of affected communities, full incorporation of\nlocal needs, philanthropic inclusiveness, transparency and power balance among stakeholders,\ngovernmental commitments and collaborative hiring as well as socialisation.\nThis thesis, therefore, contributes to the existing theories of the firm and to the\nprecious attempts to synthesise the economic and the ethical perspectives on the role of the\nfirm. It extends current theoretical understandings of the pluralistic identity organisations that\ncombine the economic and the ethical goals at their core. Moreover, it contributes to earlier\nconceptualisations of the hybrid identity organisations and the multiple identities\norganisations and supports the development of the pluralistic identity organisation theory. This\nstudy shows to which extent the identity plurality is experienced by sustainable finance and\nbanking organisations, what are the liabilities of organisational identity plurality and how\nsustainable banks resolve these liabilities.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n205\n\n9.3 Research Insights\nThrough a qualitative case study of the GABV, this thesis explored how sustainable\nbanks approach the organisational identity plurality stepping from the simultaneous pursuit of\nthe community development and the banking goals. It was discovered that sustainable banks\nexperience identity plurality due to their genuine commitment to the economic and the ethical\nroles that they view as the core of their organisational identity. Findings from this study\nindicated that the organisational identity plurality in sustainable banks affects their\norganisational structures, board governance, stakeholder relations and practice application\n(see Chapter 5). Firstly, it was found that the GABV banks face regulatory challenges, as they\ndo not fit into any established business form categories and strive to innovate continuously to\ndeliver stronger profitability and faster community development. Secondly, in terms of\ngovernance, sustainable banks work to ensure representation of stakeholders at their boards\nand high professionalism of their board committees at the same time. Thirdly, sustainable\nbanks aim to address the needs of diverse stakeholders and community members, which\nrequire innovative communication, representation and community involvement techniques.\nFinally, the GABV banks emphasise the importance of the thorough assessment of their\nprojects, which need to be financially viable and create tangible community benefit to satisfy\ntheir screening criteria. In order to combine the economic and the ethical roles, sustainable\nbanks address and resolve these challenges of identity plurality.\nThrough an abductive process of linking research findings to the previous literature,\nthe researcher proposed that the challenges of the organisational identity plurality experienced\nby sustainable banks could be divided into liabilities for multiple goals and liabilities to\nmultiple principle stakeholders. Data analysis suggested that the GABV banks address their\nliabilities for multiple goals through identity work, which includes three sets of tactics, namely\ncritiquing, contextualising and intervening (see Chapter 6). Sustainable banks within the\nGABV practice detecting the shortcomings of the conventional banking model; distancing\nthemselves from the unsustainable financial activities; historicising their banking approach in\nearlier practices of financial inclusion; localising their operations and adhering to the needs of\nlocal communities; cooperating with likeminded institutions within their sector and beyond;\nincluding groups of customers that have been previously excluded or underserved by\nconventional banking institutions; initiating change in the banking sector and empowering\ntheir customers to promote financial inclusion and community development.\nIt was further discovered that the GABV banks approach their identity plurality\nliabilities to multiple principle stakeholders through the relational identity orientation\n\n206\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nexpressed in such behaviours as inclusion of affected communities, full incorporation of local\nneeds, philanthropic inclusiveness, transparency and power balance among stakeholders,\ngovernmental commitments and collaborative hiring as well as socialisation (see Chapter 7).\nFirst, it was discovered that the sustainable banks tend to ensure wide, but selective inclusion\nof local communities affected by their operations, based on the particular needs their projects\naim to satisfy. Second, through building strong relations with selected partners, the GABV\nbanks develop a superior approach to discovering, prioritising and addressing the needs of\ncommunities in which they are embedded. Third, sustainable banks apply a similar relational\napproach to their philanthropic initiatives, which substantially differs from the “philanthropic\nselectivism” discussed and criticised by previous literature. Fourth, the GABV banks develop\ninnovative approaches to sustaining power balance among their stakeholders and ensuring\ntransparency and accountability towards their relational partners. Fifth, the GABV banks\npractice similar relational attitudes in their governmental relations by complementing\ngovernmental efforts and commitments without replacing them. Finally, sustainable banks\npractice the collaborative approach to hiring and socialisation in order to build similar\npartnership relations with their co-workers.\n\n9.4 Theoretical Contributions\nThis study extends current debates on the role of the firm and provides solid basis for\nsynthesising the economic and the ethical perspectives. The existing multiple organisational\nidentities theory (Albert & Whetten, 1985; Corley, 2004; Fiol, 1991; Pratt & Foreman, 2000;\nPratt & Kraatz, 2009; Sillince & Brown, 2009) and hybrid organisational identities theory\n(Albert & Whetten, 1985; Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Foreman & Whetten, 2002) highlighted\nthe internal and external tensions faced by organisations as a result of pursuing multiple roles.\nNonetheless, they provided little knowledge on how the organisational identity plurality is\nexperienced by organisations and which challenges and liabilities it creates. Pratt (2016) made\na first step in bridging the two perspectives by suggesting that, despite the varying assumptions\non the number of organisational identities and the relationships among them, future research\nwill benefit from combining the hybrid and the multiple identities organisation\nconceptualisations in some fashion. This study proposed synthesising the hybrid identity\norganisation theory and the multiple identities organisation theory based on the substantial\nconceptual similarities identified and discussed in Chapter 3. It used the pluralistic identity\norganisation theory lenses to explore how the organisational identity plurality is experienced\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n207\n\nby sustainable finance and banking organisations, which challenges and liabilities it possesses\nand how they can be resolved.\nThe existing theories of the firm provided valuable insights on the firms that combine\nthe economic and the ethical roles (Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Besharov & Smith, 2014;\nCanales, 2013; Pache & Santos, 2013), however, they have not sufficiently explored the effect\nof such roles plurality on the organisational identity. Battilana (2018) further suggested that\nempirical research on the organisational identity theory remains under explored and\nunderdeveloped. This study responds to these calls and contributes to the multiple\norganisational identity theory and the hybrid organisational identities theory by uncovering\nthat sustainable finance and banking organisations, which adhere to the community\ndevelopment and the financial resilience goals, face challenges and liabilities of the\norganisational identity plurality. It reveals that the ethical and the economic roles embraced\nby sustainable banks present them with liabilities for multiple goals and liabilities to multiple\nprinciple stakeholder groups. The research further contributes to the existing theories of the\nfirm by exploring how sustainable finance and banking organisations resolve these challenges\nand liabilities through the identity work. Following the process view of organisational identity\n(Corley et al., 2006; Czarniawska-Joerges, 1994; Gioia et al., 2010; Lerpold et al., 2012), it\nexplains how sustainable banks resolve the existing challenges of the organisational identity\nplurality through the combination of critiquing, contextualising and intervening identity work\ntactics. Following Schultz et al. (2012), this thesis proposes that putting the process approach\nat the basis of the organisational identity research does not undermine the existence of identity\ncontent, but shifts emphasis to the processes involved in the constitution of organisational\nidentity, which is particularly useful in case of pluralistic identity organisations.\nIn addition, this study contributes to the stakeholder theory of the firm and suggests\nthat sustainable finance and banking organisations resolve their liabilities to multiple principle\nstakeholders through the relational organisational identity orientation (Brickson, 2005; 2007).\nThe existing theory developed approaches to stakeholder engagement as a way of expressing\norganisational identity (Berrone et al., 2007; Brickson, 2005, 2007) and accessing aspects of\ninstitutional logics embedded in an organisation (Jamali, 2008). Previous studies within the\nstakeholder theory discussed multiple factors, which affect the organisational behaviour\ntowards counterparts, including the organisational purpose, stakeholder identification and\nsalience, performance evaluation and boundaries between the organisation and its stakeholders\n(Margolis & Walsh, 2003). Nonetheless, with the exception of Brickson (2005; 2007) little\nattention has been paid to the role of identity in organisational stakeholder relations. This\n\n208\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nresearch built on findings from Brickson (2005; 2007) and applied the organisational identity\norientation lenses to the study of sustainable banks. Findings from this study reveal that these\npluralistic identity organisations resolve their liabilities to multiple principle stakeholder\ngroups through the relational identity orientation expressed in the inclusion of affected\ncommunities, full incorporation of local needs, philanthropic inclusiveness, transparency and\npower balance among stakeholders, governmental commitments and collaborative hiring and\nsocialisation.\nFinally, this thesis complements the existing theory of sustainable finance and\nbanking. Previous scholarship discussed concepts of sustainable finance and banking focusing\npredominantly on the environmental or the social aspects (Bouma, Jeucken & Klinkers, 2001;\nCherneva, 2012). With the exception of Weber and Remer (2011), little comprehensive\nunderstanding has been developed to reveal how these organisations combine the economic\nand the ethical roles in society without causing a mission drift. This study generated new\ninsights on how sustainable banks experience the organisational identity plurality, explored\nthe challenges and liabilities they experience due to the simultaneous pursuit of the economic\nand the ethical goals and explained how they resolve these challenges and liabilities through\nidentity work. This thesis, therefore, extends current understandings of the role of the firm and\nsuggests that the economic and the ethical roles could be sustainable combined through the\npluralistic organisational identity approach. Nevertheless, the need remains for more empirical\nand conceptual work on the wider organisational conditions necessary for pluralistic identity\norganisations to maintain their roles plurality without causing a mission drift.\nAn additional contribution of this thesis is methodological. Although pluralistic\nidentity organisations have been a focus of many studies in the recent years, the present\nresearch is the first of which the researcher is aware to systematically follow a large cohort of\npluralistic identity organisations over time. Moreover, all the organisations featured in this\nstudy were members of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values, united by the shared\nmission, vision, values and identity. Therefore, this large population of organisations could\nhave been approached by the researcher as a single case study, with access being received and\nunique data collected. The majority of previous studies on organisations that combine the\neconomic and the ethical roles have been undertaken as in-depth single case studies that\nshowcased highly particular narratives within a narrow setting. While admitting that smaller\nresearch focus allows for collecting rich qualitative data, which is harder to achieve on larger\norganisations, the methodology employed in this study of sustainable finance and banking\norganisations attempted to avoid some of the potential shortcomings of reductionism. The\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n209\n\nrichness of the research on pluralistic identity organisations will continue to require\nmethodological variety and will benefit from studies that provide evidence confirmed by\nlarger groups of organisations governed by pluralistic organisational identities.\n\n9.5 Managerial Implications\nThree of the most salient managerial implications of this thesis should be pointed out.\nFirst, findings suggest that sustainable combination of the economic and the ethical roles of\nthe firm could be achieved through close attention to two sets of organisational liabilities:\nliabilities for multiple goals and liabilities to multiple stakeholders. Given the current\nunsustainable state of the global financial system, banks and banking cooperatives face\nconstant challenges of creating both profit and value. However, as witnessed in the Global\nAlliance for Banking on Values, accepting liabilities for the community development and for\nthe financial profitability can successfully co-exist and deliver fruitful results. For the GABV\nbanks, the focus on three sets of identity work tactics allowed them to simultaneously keep\nattention at both roles and avoid a mission drift. The lesson here for managers is to consider\nhow an organisation might go beyond the profitability concerns to embrace the community\ndevelopment challenges that have proven to sustainably co-exist in fellow organisations.\nAlthough it is unlikely that the community benefit will completely overrule the financial logic\nof the conventional financial institutions, adopting certain identity work tactics discussed in\nthis thesis may provide High Street banks with valuable instruments for making their business\nmore sustainable over time.\nSecond, there is an important implication of the present thesis about how to manage\norganisational stakeholder relation and prioritise claims from multiple groups perceived by an\norganisation as core and undeniable. It was discovered that sustainable banks tend to adopt\nwhat stakeholder theory described as a relational identity orientation in their stakeholder\nrelations. The study provides a detailed outlook of the particular expressions of this relational\napproach observed in the GABV banks and suggests that the relational standing plays a crucial\nrole in mitigating liabilities to multiple principle stakeholder groups derived from the\nsimultaneous pursuit of the community development and the financial goals. Thus, the GABV\nexample provides a cautionary tale for managers interested in adopting a more sustainable\ndevelopment path: ensuring a wide but nonetheless selective inclusion of interested parties to\nensure durable partnerships based on mutual trust, transparency and accountability. Selectivity\nof the GABV banks in their stakeholder relations is always driven by the needs of the\n\n210\n\nCONCLUSION\n\ncommunities, in which they are embedded, connections to the interested parties and\navailability of resources.\nFinally, findings from this research make very clear that organisational identity is an\nimportant mechanism by which values are translated to internal and external audiences, who\ncan support organisations in achieving their goals. The success and rapid growth of the GABV\nverifies that the community development and the financial resilience goals are not mutually\nexclusive and can sustainably co-exist within organisations. Like the sustainable banking\ncommunity, other innovators may hold valuable insights about where to seek simultaneous\nprofit and community benefit or may serve as bellwethers who can indicate when the\nsimultaneous pursuit of these goals is plausible and possible.\n\n9.6 Policy Implications\nThe existing debates on the role of the firm infer that organisations are increasingly\ntaking a political responsibility and performing governmental tasks. Some scholars attributed\nsubstantial political responsibilities to corporate actors (Schneider & Scherer, 2015), such as\ncontribution to provision of public goods, protection of human rights and engagement in\ncorporate self-regulation and self-restrain. It was also argued that organisational participation\nin public policy should be democratically legitimated by incorporating democratic practices\ninto corporate governance (Ibid). Other scholars (Loughlin et al., 2013) advocated for a\nsubsidiarity-based approach to political responsibilities of the firm. Their proposed that\norganisations have political co-responsibilities in society, while state actors retain the main\nresponsibilities and develop governance structures that allow organisations to take political\nresponsibilities (Assländer & Curbach, 2017). Findings from this study suggest that\nsustainable banks take relational approach to their government relations and act as subsidiarity\nactors who have political co-responsibilities in society (Tempels et all., 2017). This thesis,\ntherefore, contributes to discussions around the scope of political responsibilities of the firm\nand the scale of organisational interactions with national governments.\nFindings from this study suggest that, even though sustainable banks occasionally get\ninvolved in the provision of public goods and the protection of human rights, guided by their\nrelational approach to stakeholder relations they aim to contribute to the community\n\ndevelopment goals without substituting the state function. They also actively engage with the\ngovernance initiatives like the UN Global Compact, the UN’s Sustainable Development\nGoals, UNEP FI, roundtable meetings and multi-stakeholder alliances. Therefore, it could be\nclaimed that sustainable banks understand political responsibilities as shared responsibilities\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n211\n\nthat require both the firm and the state to cooperate in addressing societal challenges. The\nrelational identity orientation of sustainable banks creates a solid basis for supporting local\ngovernments in creating institutional frameworks, including higher public institutions, for\nfostering the community development.\nMoreover, findings from this research provide reasons to rethink what in practice can\nbe expected of firms in addressing community development challenges. The relational identity\norientation of sustainable banks empowers them to take a more hands-on approach to\n\nremedying community problems through creating workable partnerships with local\ngovernments based on their identity, mission and values. It further orients these pluralistic\nidentity organisations towards public–private initiatives with other actors (e.g. multistakeholder alliances) for collectively action. In addition, the relational identity orientation of\nsustainable banks encourages them to engage with other actors to create public institutions for\nsituations that require voluntarily or coercive coordination. Findings from this study further\nimply that sustainable banks not only develop their private initiatives, but also support local\nauthorities in developing governance schemes, which would allow for fair and effective\norganisational engagement. Moreover, the GABV members assist local governments that lack\nthe capacity to effectively address the community development problems and build\npartnership links with other actors, whose involvement might be beneficiary. At the same time,\nin such partnerships local governments remain the primary responsible actors for initiatives\nthat require coercion and for a fair allocation of public goods.\nBuilding on the findings from this thesis, local governments could devote additional\n\nefforts to develop guidelines that would encourage, stimulate and support firms in contributing\nto the welfare of communities in which they are embedded. In addition, more nuanced and\nbalanced legislation should be proposed to support further development of private-public\npartnerships based on the relational identity orientation approach. A combination of such\nefforts and close attention to cooperation with organisations that willingly contribute to\n\ndeveloping their local communities could help address structural injustices and ensure better\nprovision of public goods and services.\n\n9.7 Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research\nThis thesis focused on the sustainable banking identity as a case of the pluralistic\norganisational identity determined by the simultaneous pursuit of the economic and the ethical\nroles of the firm. This research provided some insights into how sustainable banks manage to\nfulfil their liabilities for multiple goals and liabilities to multiple principle stakeholders\n\n212\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nstepping from the combination of the economic and the ethical roles without causing a mission\ndrift. It featured the role of organisational identity and called attention to organisational\nidentity work and organisational identity orientation in achieving these challenging goals.\nNonetheless, more research is required to explore other organisational features and processes\nthat could support or constrain the organisational identity plurality. Moreover, this thesis\nexclusively focused on the organisational identity within pluralistic identity organisations\nfollowing the suggestion of Pratt (2016: 107), who claimed that “hybrid organisational\nidentities should not be confused with hybrid organisations or hybrid organising, which are\nbroader concepts referring to organisations that combine identities, forms and/or or\ninstitutional logics to create a new type of organisation.” Future research will need to explore\nthe relationships between these concepts and their role in sustaining pluralistic organisational\nidentities over time.\nFuture research will need to explore whether the pluralistic organisational identity\nframework could help bridge knowledge gaps and generate insights in other organisational\nsettings. It should further study which additional organisational features of pluralistic identity\norganisations can contribute to mitigating the complexity associated with the simultaneous\npursuit of the economic and the ethical roles of the firm. Future research might broaden focus\nfrom pluralistic identity organisations as the level of analysis and adopt an institutional view\nto explore how pluralistic identities organisations could be supported on the institutional level.\nSustainable banks that simultaneously pursue the economic and ethical roles in society are\nprofoundly shaped by challenges and liabilities arising from their aims to remain financial\nviable and to advance the lives of the communities in which they are embedded. This makes\nthem perfectly suited for exploring how organisations experience the identity plurality, which\nchallenges it causes and how they can be resolved. Continued inquiries about pluralistic\nidentity organisations will substantially advance our current understanding of the ways to\nbring together business, the society and the environment and will help establish connections\nbetween the academic knowledge about the conventional organisations and the pluralistic\nidentity organisations.\n\n9.8 Conclusion\nThis thesis moved forward from discussing whether the economic and the ethical\ngoals could co-exist within organisations to exploring how they could be combined without\ncausing a mission drift. It researched sustainable finance and banking organisations that have\nlong been involved in pursuing the community development mission, while simultaneously\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n213\n\nengaging in commercial activities to finance their operations. Although certain elements of\npluralistic identity organisations associated with the GABV banks might always remain niche\nand non-appealing for mainstream banking, findings from this study suggest that firms have\nthe ability to combine the financial and the community development goals. Similarly, this\nthesis has been a source of personal discovery and motivation. While the researcher believes\nthat this work makes several contributions to the role of the firm debates, she is most excited\nabout the broader research program that it has inspired. The process of writing this thesis\nintroduced the researcher to many research tools and approaches that she will take with her as\nshe embarks on her own path of academic exploration.\n\n214\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nSustainable Banking: Identity and Liabilities\n\nAdams, D.

Name of the GABV member:\n2. Name of participant:\n3. Job title:\n4. Form of the organisation:\nGeneral introduction and interview rationale\nThank you for taking the time to speak with me. I am a doctoral researcher at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh Business School. I am conducting research that focuses on\nunderstanding sustainable banking and finance and specifically the Global Alliance for\nBanking on Values. To do this, I am interviewing people who are involved with the GABV\nand its member banks.\n\nI want to assure you that your responses will be confidential. Your name, any other\nnames you mention and your organisation’s name will not be disclosed to anyone; there will\nnot be any information reported that could identify you. I will report the findings anonymously\nand as an aggregate. Your participation is voluntary and if you wish, you can withdraw at any\npoint. You can also choose not to respond to any question. The duration of the interview will\nbe approximately 45 minutes to one hour.\nIf you agree to participate, we can proceed with the interview. [Pause, proceed after\nreceiving verbal consent].\nParticipant Background Information\n1.

What is role within the GABV? How long have you been working with the Alliance?\n3. What was your motivation to join a GABV bank?\n4. How would you describe your knowledge or understanding of sustainable banking? [Probes:\nWould you describe it as professional? If not, how deep is your knowledge?]\nSustainable Banking Identity\n5. What would you name as the core characteristics that make your organisation a “sustainable\nbank”? [Probe: Ask about specific organisational traits or actions.]\n6. How would you describe the community, which your organisation serves? [Probe: Who is\nyour typical client? Ask for specific examples.]\n\nAPPENDICES\n\n245\n\n7.

[Probe: ask for specific names and examples.]\n12. In your perception, could sustainable finance become mainstream? [Probe: if they foresee\nchallenges, ask why they exist and whether and how they can be revolved.]\n13. How do you see the future of sustainable finance and banking? [Probe: if they expect any\nchanges, ask why are they necessary and how likely they are to happen.]\nSustainable Banking Identity Orientation\nWhen answering these questions, please think about your bank in terms of those\nqualities that are the most central (defining), distinctive (distinguishable from other\norganisations) and enduring (long-term). Think about your bank as a whole and not in terms\nof specific individuals or departments. Also, please answer in terms of how your bank is rather\nthan as how you would ideally like it to be.\n\n14.
