Hence, option C is correct.\n\nWhat is  the English Bill of Rights?\n\nThis first Act of the English Parliament has been in the custody of Parliament ever since it was passed. Parliamentary privilege, or the right to free speech, free elections, and regular legislatures were all firmly established by the Bill. To make or alter laws, Parliament must convene frequently.\n\nA constitutional monarchy with legislative limitations on the king or queen's power was formed in England as a result of the English Bill of Rights.
