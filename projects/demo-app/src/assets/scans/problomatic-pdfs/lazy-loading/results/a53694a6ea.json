CONCLUSION\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1.1 Nature's forms\n\n\"The straight line belongs to man, the curved line\nbelongs to God.\"\nAntonio Gaudi\n\nInspiration in a design process often comes from Nature. Philosophically speaking, it is\nnot possible for it to emerge from any other source .Everything we know about the world\nis derived from the perception the human being has of its surroundings. Every\nexperience gets written into our brains over the 5-sense conductor, leaving us incapable\nto draw inspiration from something that is beyond our comprehension or our knowledge.\nIf that is so, in order to talk about structural design, we have to start with the structural\ncharacteristics of the surrounding world. One look around will show us that Nature\nknows no right angle, nor does it use straight lines. Although there are lots of similarities\nbetween species of different life forms, it uses no repetition of basic structural elements\nfor the sake of production costs. Actually every structural part of natural systems is\nunique, however big or small it is. One glance at the human history and structural\ndesign in architecture shows a constant use of straight lines, orthogonal connections\nand as much repetition of elements as possible. This contrast has a pretty\nstraightforward and reasonable justification. Many systems people made were and still\nare inspired and influenced by Nature, but the degree of its simplification and\nabstraction always depended on knowledge, production ability and resources. Because\nof the lack of technology enabling the copying of Nature in an exact manner, the main\nprinciples were extracted and simplified. In order to use most of the tree trunks, they\nwere cut longitudinal, thus producing straight wooden boards. Iron and steel were cast\nand rolled into straight beams because it was easier. In the XVII century Renatus\nCartesius, better known as Rene Descartes, defines a Cartesian coordinate system for\n\n5\n\nspace representation, where the rectilinear convention was logical and easy to plan.\nNatural systems of primary and secondary structures were reproduced with simplified\nelements like columns, beams and ribs. Due to the uniform effect of gravitation, force\nslabs were built planar, for people to be able to walk on them. Experience and intuition\nindicated that longitudinal elements are best exploited when the gravity force acts\nupon them parallel to their longer axis (causing axial pressure and tension, instead of\nbending), which made a logical development of vertical walls and columns as basic\nbearing structural elements. Everything fitted, and the complexity of building structures\nwas mostly kept in those limits. Monumentality was achieved by varying\nthe number and size of the elements. Although rectilinear system evolved into a rule in\ndesign and architecture, there have always been exceptions throughout history , and as\ntechnology development progressed they became more frequent. Because we are born\ninto geometrically controlled houses and cities, we are used to the idea that rectilinear\nsolutions are optimal precisely due to their simplicity. If the simplicity is something\ndesirable or if “simplicity is the ultimate sophistication” as Leonardo Da Vinci claimed ,\nthen the degree and level of simplification is where the problem lies and in the fact that\nits definition has constantly changed throughout history. As science goes from\ncentimeters and millimeters over nanometers to unknown depths of elementary\nparticles, in every field of research there is an expansion, branching and division into\nsmaller, simpler elements that build the system. The definition of simple suddenly\nbecomes blurry and it has to be carefully weighed up for each problem.\nFollowing that principle of constant division, straight lines can be divided and combined\ninto polylines. By letting lengths of polyline parts converge toward zero, smooth natural\ncurves can be obtained. Similarly, we can connect plane surfaces, multiply them and\nlet their areas incline toward zero to form a continuous free-from surface We are\nexpanding the range of our possibilities and we are always able to choose the degree of\nsimplification at the cost of production expenses.\n\nIf everything in Nature is made out of free (irregular) forms, we can only ask ourselves\nwhy that is the case. The reason is that all structures are reactions to the forces in\nNature acting upon them, or as D’Arcy phrased it, “The form of an object is a diagram\n\n6\n\nof forces” . Since those forces are highly complex, irregular and non-uniform, structural\nsystems adjusted themselves to resist those influences in the best possible way. In\nexploring what the best possible way means for Nature, it was realized that throughout\nthe years of evolution it attempts to minimize material and minimize potential energy in\nits creations. When drawing a parallel to the structural design, it is important to mention\nthat Nature’s optimization of structures has a certain dimension of robustness and\nsafety coefficient. An interesting thing is the actual risk assessment of Nature that can\nbe further explored for structural optimization techniques. Challenges in design do have\na parallel in Nature, since they are both trying to resolve the problem of optimal design\nfor utilisation of human beings. In order to materialize these thoughts in terms of design\nobjects, some of the criteria that should define form and structure have to be\nconsidered. First, there are external influences, like gravitation, sun, wind, snow, etc.\nSecond, there are user requirements, expressed as different human functions or needs.\nThird, there is a creativity factor that is multiplied with free forms. Creativity is a term not\nknown by Nature. Nature’s variety is a searching technique to find a better solution\naccording to different criteria, i.e., a solution that will survive. In order to describe this\nevolutionary process in Nature and draw a parallel to our mental processes that involve\nthe discovery of new ideas, people defined the notion of creativity. But much more\nimportant, the notion of Beauty evolved into a science of proportions and design rules,\nwhereas Beauty is also a term not known by Nature. We use it to describe something\nthat gives us a perceptual experience of pleasure, hence something that is optimal for\nsome specific set of conditions (objective or subjective). Combining external and\ninternal, non-uniform influences, we have to agree that geometrical simplification\nprincipally doesn’t lead to the minimal energy and minimal material solution. People\ninclined toward those spatial answers over the years for several reasons. An obvious\none were the productions costs, followed by an extreme simplification of functional\nneeds. Namely, gravity was one of the most important external forces and therefore\nconsidered as the dominant structural factor. Simplified functional organization fitted into\nthe rectilinear system. That is how simple boxes were formed, whereas many other\nexternal or internal influences had to fit into those boundaries, defined by only a few\nfactors which were taken into consideration. One of the ways to express creativity was\n\n7\n\nthe use of ornament, a pure decoration, made to imitate Nature’s complexity and\nachieve Beauty, thereby having no functional justification. There was still a lot of room\nfor designers to express their creativity but the structural system was often there to limit\nthe imagination.\n\nSo we are ready to climb one step up toward the natural systems. The technology exists\nand the principles that will enable us to use it in the best way possible have to be\nestablished.\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n1.2 FINDING INSPIRATION IN NATURE\n\nOver the last 3.6 billion years, nature has gone through a process of trial and error to\nrefine the living organisms, processes, and materials on planet Earth. The emerging\nfield of biomimetics has given rise to new technologies created from biologically inspired\nengineering at both the macro scale and nanoscale levels. Biomimetics is not a new\nidea. Humans have been looking at nature for answers to both complex and simple\nproblems throughout our existence. Nature has allready solved many of today's\nengineering problems such as hydrophobicity, wind resistance, self-assembly, and\nharnessing solar energy through the evolutionary mechanics of selective advantages.\nBut for centuries, men have been used natures elements only for decorative purposes.\nStraight line, or segment of an arc represented resistance to the nature's forces.\nArchitectural thinking throughout centuries was based firmly on Euclidean thought and\nPlatonic solids-The cylinder, pyramid, cube, prism and sphere were not only the\nessential forms of the Egyptian, Greek and Roman architecture, as observed by Le\nCorbusier, but were also universal geometric “primitives” of the digital solid modeling\nsoftware of the late twentieth century. They are no longer seen, however, as some kind\nof unique, isolated archetypes, but as special cases of quadrie parametric surfaces.\nEuclid’s Elements proposed five basic postulates of geometry, of which all were\nconsidered self-evident except the fifth postulate of “parallelism,” which asserts that two\nlines are parallel, i.e. non-intersecting, if there is a third line that intersects both\nperpendicularly. The consequence of this postulate in Euclidean geometry is that\nthrough every point there is one and only one line parallel to any other line.\nRenaissance demanded straight lines in her structures, because it was directly related\nto Greek and roman principles, and perspective rules as well. As the science was\ndeveloping, the idea of a curved surface was getting more and more accepted. In\nBaroque , that idea was considered on a philosophical level: . And with Leibniz, the\n\n11\n\ncurvature of the universe extends in accordance with three other fundamental notions:\nthe fluidity of matter, the elasticity of bodies, the spring as mechanism. In the first place,\nit is certain that matter would not of itself move in a curved line: it would follow the\ntangent (Preface to the New Essays). But the universe is, as it Were, compressed by an\nactive force which gives a curvilinear or swirling movement to matter, following to its end\na curve with no tangent. And the infinite division of matter means that the compressive\nforce relates each portion of matter to its surroundings, to the surrounding parts which\nbathe and penetrate the body in question, determining its curvature. Ceaselessly\ndividing, the parts of matter form little swirls within a swirl, and in them there are other,\nsmaller ones, and still more in the concave intervals of the swirls which touch one\nanother. Matter thus offers a texture that is infinitely porous, that is spongy or cavernous\nwithout empty parts, since there is always a cavern in the cavern: each body, however\nSmall it may be, contains a World insofar as it is perforated by uneven passageways.\n\nThe contemporary digital architectures appear to reject any notion of urban and\nstructural typology, continuity and morphology, and historic style and perspectical\nframework—they represent an ideological, conceptual and formal break much like\nWalter Gropius’s Bauhaus in Dessau, Germany. They seem to prefigure an entirely new\nway of architectural thinking, one that ignores conventions of style or aesthetics\naltogether in favor of continuous experimentation based on digital generation and\ntransformation of forms that respond to complex contextual or functional influences,\nboth static and dynamic. The new digital architectures might be non-typological,\ndiscontinuous, amorphous, non-perspectical,\n\nhistoric... But they are not without a\n\nprecedent. Since Baroque, architects have been trying to go beyond the Cartesian grid\nand the established norms of beauty and proportion in architecture. The parallels\nbetween contemporary and Baroque thought are indeed multiple, as contemporary\nreading of Deleuze’s Fold shows, leading to labels such as “Neo-Baroque” being\napplied to new architectures. The biomorphic forms are, of course, not new, from the\nexcesses of Baroque to organic design vocabularies of the early- and mid-twentieth\ncentury.\n\nRafael Moneo speaks of “forgotten geometries lost to us because of the\n\ndifficulties of their representation.“ The forms of Gehry’s recent projects could be traced\n\n12\n\nto the Expressionism of the 1920s; one could argue that there are ample precedents for\nGreg Lynn’s “blobs” in Surrealism. Earlier precedents could be found in the organic,\nbiomorphic forms of Art Nouveau or, more specifically, in the sinuous curvilinear lines of\nHector Guimard’s Metro Stations in Paris. And then there is Gaudi’s oeuvre of highly\nsculptural buildings with complex, organic geometric forms rigorously engineered\nthrough his own invented method of modeling curves by suspending linked chains.\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n2.1 CAD: COMPUTER AS A TOOL\n\nFor the last five decades, beginning with early CAD programs and continuing through\nhigh-end computer graphics, modeling, and animation systems, architects have been\nincreasingly concerned with the possible loss of control over their own designs due to\nthe powerful yet complicated, if not mysterious, nature of computers. This concern has\nled them to position themselves within a wide spectrum of speculations about the effect\nof computers on design that ranges from complete rejection, elitism, or demonization of\ntheir use as design generators to the complete antithesis, that of adoration, worship, or\npopularization of their use. When comparing avid computer users to those reluctant to\nengage with them it is necessary to overlook many significant and distinguishing\ndifferences in order to identify at least one common theme: the assessment that there is\nsomething different, unprecedented, and extraordinary about the computer as it\ncompares to traditional manual tools.\nDiscretization of design by definition can be addressed, described, and codified using\ndiscrete\n\nprocesses\n\nexecuted\n\ntoday\n\nby\n\ndiscrete\n\nnumerical\n\nmachines\n\n(i.e.\n\ncomputers).However, the problem is that discrete/quantitative design provokes a fear of\nrationalistic determinism that is long considered to be a restraint to the designer’s\nimagination and freedom.\nSuch resistances have attempted to discredit Computer Aided Design (CAD) products\nor processes as inadequate, irrelevant, or naïve. According to the humanistic position,\ndesign is considered a high-level intellectual endeavor constructed through uniquely\nhuman strategies, i.e. intuition, choice, or interpretation. Such theoretical design models\nnegate computation as a possible means for design realization mainly because it is\nbased on discrete processes that are finite and, as such, restrictive.\n\n17\n\nWhat should be the exact scope of the computer’s involvement with design?\n\nThis question has been present since the beginning of computer aided architecture. It\nplayed of course, a fundamental role in the first reflections and experiments regarding\na possible computed or cybernetic architecture in the 1950s and 1960s.It did not\ndisappear with the advent of post-modernism.\n\n.It is only during the last decade, with the spectacular development of computer\ngraphics and the fascination exerted by the strange forms, the blobs and others that\nbegan to float on the designers’ screens that this question was momentarily suspended.\nNow that this fascination is beginning to fade, the issue is back with all its complexity.\nTypically, the positions regarding the role of the computer in architectural design fall\ninto two categories. For many designers, the computer is just an advanced tool running\nprograms that enable them to produce sophisticated forms and to control better their\nrealization. For those designers, although the machine does alter significantly the nature\nof the architecture that is produced, it is not necessary or even desirable to enter into\nthe details of its inner processes. Despite their claim to the contrary, the greatest part of\nthe blob architects fall into this category.\nThere is the other group composed of those who think that it has become unavoidable\nto enter into the black box of programming in order to make a truly creative use of the\ncomputer.\n\n18\n\nCAD/CAM systems, used by designers, were actually developed for the consumer\nproduct industry. Animation software, such as Softimage, Alias, and Maya, were\ndeveloped for the special effects needs of the film industry. This interest of architects in\nthe re-use of technology and methods from other industries is nothing new. Designers\nhave always looked beyond the boundaries of their discipline, appropriating materials,\nmethods and processes from other industries as needed. Historically, these technology\ntransfers have been at the core of many successful advances, widening the scope of\ninnovation and continually affecting the prevalent norms of practice. Today, much of the\ninnovation and change stems from the adoption of digital design and production\nprocesses based on CAD/CAM processes, and from new materials invented for, and\nwidely used in, the product design, automotive, aerospace and shipbuilding industries.\nThe impact of the adoption of innovative technologies in those industries was\nprofound—there was a complete reinvention of how products were designed and made.\nToday, various appliances, cars, airplanes and ships are entirely designed, developed,\nanalyzed and tested in a digital environment, and are then manufactured using digitallydriven technologies. Boeing 777, “the first 100% digitally designed aircraft,” is probably\none of the best-known examples . Buildings have that same potential to be digitally\nconceived and produced. While the CAD/CAM technological advances and the resulting\nchanges in design and production techniques had an enormous impact on other\nindustries, there has yet to be a similarly significant and industry-wide impact in the\nworld of design and construction. The opportunities for the design, engineering and\nconstruction (ABC) industries are beckoning, and the benefits are already manifested in\nrelated fields.\n\nI tend to believe that now, a designer/architect’s creativity is limited by the very\nprograms that are supposed to free their imagination. There is a finite amount of ideas\nthat a brain can imagine or produce by using a CAD application. If a designer/architect\ndoesn’t find the tool/icon that they want they just can’t translate that idea into form. And\nwhenever they see a new icon (let’s say “meta-balls”) they think they are now able to do\nsomething cool. But are they really doing anything new? If a designer knew the\nmathematical principles and some of the programming behind the newest effects, they\n\n19\n\nwould be empowered to always keep expanding their knowledge and scholarship by\nalways devising solutions un tackled by anybody else. By using a conventional program,\nand always relying on its design possibilities, the designer/architect’s work is sooner or\nlater at risk of being grossly imitated by lesser-devised solutions. By cluttering the field\nwith imitations of a particular designer’s style, one runs the risk of being associated not\nwith the cutting-edge research, but with a mannerism of architectural style. In this light,\nthere are many designers claiming to use the computer to design. But are they really\ncreating a new design? Or are they just re-arranging existing information within a\ndomain set by the programmer? If it is the programmer who is asking first all the\nquestions, who is really setting the parameters and the outcome of a good design? We\nsaw already the I-Generation (Internet-Generation). When are we going to see the CGeneration(Code-Generation) – the generation of designers/architects that can take its\nfate into their own hands?\n\nWhat makes design problematic for scientists and engineers is that they have\nmaintained a doctrine of rationalistic determinism in their fields. It is the theory that the\nexercise of reason provides the only valid basis for action or belief and that reason is\nthe prime source of knowledge. Because of its clarity and efficiency, rationalistic\ndeterminism has traditionally been a dominant mode of thought in the world of science.\nThe problem with this is that it assumes that all human activities abide to the same\nprinciples. In contrast, design, as defined in the arts and architecture, is based on quite\ndifferent, if not opposite, principles. Rather than following a rationalistic model\n,designers often employ the acceptance of empiricism, authority, spiritual revelation,\nmetaphor or analogy as sources for their design inspiration. In addition, they quite often\ndefy the rules of scientific planning and scheduling. This mode of thought, which we call\nhere intuition, comes in contrast to the dominant model of science where rational,\nmethodical, and systematic processes exist. More than ever now, as design enters the\nworld of science, or as science enters the world of design, a complementing and\nharmonious mix of both thought processes is needed.\n\n20\n\n21\n\n2.2 DIGITAL MORPHOGENESIS\n\nIn contemporary architectural design, digital media is increasingly being used not as a\nrepresentational tool for visualization but as a generative tool for the derivation of form\nand its transformation—the digital morphogenesis. In a radical departure from centuriesold traditions and norms of architectural design, digitally -generated forms are not\ndesigned or drawn as the conventional understanding of these terms would have it, but\nthey are calculated by the chosen generative computational method. Instead of\nmodeling an external form, designers articulate an internal generative logic, which then\nproduces, in an automatic fashion, a range of possibilities from which the designer could\nchoose an appropriate formal proposition for further development. The predictable\nrelationships between design and representations are abandoned in favor of\ncomputationally-generated complexities. Models of design capable of consistent\n,continual and dynamic transformation are replacing the static norms of conventional\nprocesses. Complex curvilinear geometries are produced with the same ease as\nEuclidean geometries of planar shapes and cylindrical, spherical or conical forms. The\nplan no longer “generates” the design; sections attain a purely analytical role. Grids,\nrepetitions and symmetries lose their past raison d ’étre, as infinite variability becomes\nas feasible as modularity, and as mass-customization presents alternatives to massproduction. The digital generative processes are opening up new teritories for\nconceptual, and tectonic exploration, articulating an architectural morphology. The\nemphasis shifts from the “making of form” to the “finding of form,” which various\ndigitally-based generative techniques seem to bring about intentionally. In the realm of\nform, the stable is replaced by the variable, singularity by multiplicity.\n\n22\n\n23\n\n2.3 TOPOLOGY\n\nComputational, digital architectures are defined by computationally-based processes of\nform origination and transformations, i.e. the processes of digital morphogenesis, where\nthe plural (“architectures”) emphasizes multiplicities inherent in the logics of the\nunderlying computational concepts, such as topological geometries, isomorphic\npolysurfaces (“blobs”), motion kinematics and dynamics, keyshape animation\n(metamorphosis), parametric design, genetic algorithms (evolutionary architectures),\nperformance, etc., which are discussed in more detail in the following sections.\nThe notion of topology has particular potentiality in architecture, as emphasis shifis\naway from particular forms of expression to relations that exist between and within an\nexisting site and the proposed program. These interdependences then become the\nstructuring, organizing principle for the generation and transformation of form. According\nto its mathematical definition, topology is a study of intrinsic, qualitative properties of\ngeometric forms that are not normally affected by changes in size or shape, i.e. which\nremain invariant through continuous one-to-one transformations or elastic deformations,\nsuch as stretching or twisting. A circle and an ellipse, for example, or a square and a\nrectangle, can be considered to be topologically equivalent, as both circle and square\ncould be deformed by stretching them into an ellipsoid or rectangle, respectively. A\nsquare and a rectangle have the same number of edges and the same number of\nvertices, and are, therefore, topologically identical, or homeomorphic. This quality of\nhomeomorphism is particularly interesting, as focus is on the relational structure of an\nobject and not on its geometry—the same topological structure could be geometrically\nmanifested in an infinite number of forms.\nTopological transfomiations first and foremost, affect the relational structure and, thus\nthe resulting forms. For example a rectangle could be transformed into a triangle with a\nsingle topological operation of deleting one of its vertices. Because of their intrinsic\nproperty of one sidedness, topological structures such as the Mobius strip have a\npotential for an architecture in which the boundaries between what is interior and what\n\n24\n\nis exterior are blurred, an architecture that avoids the nonnative distinctions of “inside”\nand “outside.” What makes topology particularly appealing are not the complex forms,\nsuch as the Mobius strip, but the primacy over form of the structures of relations,\ninterconnections or inherent qualities which exist internally and externally within the\ncontext of an architectural project.\n\n25\n\n26\n\n2. 4 NURBS\n\nContemporary free form shaped buildings have manufacturing principles with the roots\nin the aeronautical and ship-building industry.The majority of construction methods in\nfree form architecture today (taking Frank O. Gehry’s buildings as an example) is made\nwith the help of vast experience in ship, aeronautical and car industry. Aside from\nmanufacturing methods, the software able to represent free form surfaces, with\nmathematical precision, was initially developed for ship and car bodies. Pierre B ́ezier,\nan employee of Renault, and Paul de Casteljau from Citroen, pioneered the principle in\nthe 1950s with the polynomial representation of curves. From B ́ezier splines the\nproblem was generalized to create non uniform, rational B-Splines and was eventually\ndeveloped into Non Uniform Rational Basis Spline surfaces, or NURBS surfaces.\nDue to the fact that it is possible to represent practically any shape with the use of\nNURBS, they entered the CAD world in the 80’s and prospered very fast to become the\nmain tool today for the geometrical representation of free form in all fields of design.\nThe research presented is made with the help of Rhinoceros 3D software, a commercial\nNURBS based 3D modeling tool.\n\n. While the mathematical concept and software implementation of NURBS as surfaces\nis a prod-uct of applied numerical computation, the rearrangement of their control points\nthrough commercial software is simply an affine transformation, i.e. a translation.\nPresently, an alternative choice is being formulated that may escape these dialectically\nopposed strategies: algorithmic architecture. It involves the designation of software\nprograms to generate space and form from the rule-based logic inherent in design\nprograms, typologies, building code, and language itself. Instead of direct programming,\nthe codification of design intention using scripting languages available in 3D packages\n(i.e. Maya EmbeddedLanguage (MEL), 3dMaxScript, and FormZ) can build consistency,\nstructure, coherency, traceability, and intelligence into computerized 3D form. By using\nscripting languages designers can go beyond the mouse, transcending the factory-set\n\n27\n\nlimitations of current 3D software. Algorithmic design does not eradicate differences but\nincorporates both computational complexity and creative use of computers. For\narchitects, algorithmic design enables the role of the designer to shift from “design\nprogramming” to “programming design.” Rather than investing in arrested conflicts,\ncomputational terms might be better exploited by this alternative choice. For the first\ntime perhaps, industrial design might be aligned with neither formalism nor rationalism\nbut with intelligent form and traceable creativity.\n\n. The term spline in NURBS) actually has its origin in shipbuilding, where it was used to\nrefer to a piece\nof steamed wood shaped into a desired smooth curve and kept in shape with clamps\nand pegs. Mathematicians borrowed the term in a direct analogy to describe families of\ncomplex curves. The shape of a NURBS curve can be changed by manipulating its\ncontrol points and associated weights, as well as the degree of the curve itself . The\nNURBS curves are shaped primarily by changing the location of control points, which do\nnot have to lie on the curve itself, except for the endpoints. Each control point has an\nassociated weight, which determines the extent of its influence over the curve, in a\ndirect\nanalogy to drafting splines. Increasing the weight of a control point pulls the\ncorresponding curve or surface toward that control point and vice versa. Each control\npoint has an associated polynomial equation, commonly referred to as a basis function\n(the in NURBS, and in B-splines in general). A rational B-spline (the in NURBS) is\ndefined mathematically as the ratio of two polynomial equations, i.e.\ntwo basis functions. Each basis function affects only the curve section in the vicinity of\nthe associated control point, and these sections are delimited by knots. A non-uniforrn\nrational B-spline is one in which the influence of a control point (i.e. the associated basis\nfunction) on a curvature can be varied by changing the location of the knots along the\ncontrol segment that links two control points; in other words, a non-uniform rational Bspline is one with unequal knot spacing.\n\n28\n\nOther spline curves. as subcategories of NURBS. are typically available in modeling\nsoftware. B-splines are actually NURBS with equally weighted control points (thus\nweights are not displayed). Bézier curves named after Pierre Bézier\n\nthe French\n\nautomotive engineer who invented them are B-splines with equal knot spacings (thus\nknots are not shown) Cubic curves are actually third-degree continuous Be'zier curves,\nand quadratic curves are second-degree continuous Bezier curves. In this pseudotaxonomy of spline curves, at each level an additional set of controls over curvature is\nlost: weights in the case of B-splines, and both weights and knots in the case of Bézier\ncurves.“ An important property of curves made by splines is that their curvature, i.e. the\ncurve radius, changes continually along their length, in sharp contrast to curves made of\ntangent circular ares, which, despite their smooth appearance, have discrete points at\nwhich the curvature changes abruptly. Besides fluid dynamics, the curvature continuity\nalso has important aesthetic and manufacturing implications, which is why most\nmodeling programs provide\ntools for the continuity analysis. The location of control points in a NURBS curve can\naffect its continuity locally. meaning that different segments can have different levels of\ncontinuity. For instance, two coincident control points in a NURBS curve would\npronounce the curvature; three coincident control points would produce an angular\ncusp. This potentiality of NURBS curves of having varying continuity is referred to as\nmultiplicity. The definition of NURBS surfaces is a straightforward extension of NURBS\ncurves. A control lattice that connects control points surrounds the surface . Each\ncontrol point has an associated weight parameter, and knots control the distribution of\nthe local influence as in curves. ln other words. the shape of a NURBS surface can be\nmanipulated in the same ways as in curves.\n\n29\n\n30\n\n3.1 WHAT IS ALGORITHM ?\n\nAn algorithm is a process of addressing a problem in a finite number of steps. It is an\narticulation of either a strategic plan for solving a known problem or a stochastic search\ntowards possible solutions to a partially known problem. In doing so, it serves as a\ncodification of the problem through a series of finite, consistent, and rational steps.\nWhile most algorithms are designed with a specific solution in mind to a problem, there\nare some problems whose solution is unknown, vague, or ill-defined. In the latter case,\nalgorithms become the means for exploring possible paths that may lead to potential\nsolutions.\nAn algorithm can be seen as a mediator between the human mind and the computer’s\nprocessing power. This ability of an algorithm to serve as a translator can be interpreted\nas bi-directional: either as a means of dictating to the computer how to go about solving\nthe problem, or as a reflection of a human thought into the form of an algorithm.\nIn this case, the human programmer serves the purpose of translating a process\nexternal to the human mind to be compiled into machine language which is also\nexternal to the human mind. For instance, a genetic\n\nalgorithm is a process that\n\nsimulates the behavior and adaptation of a population of candidate solutions over time\nas generations are created, tested, and selected through repetitive mating and\nmutation. The algorithm uses a stochastic search based on the chance that a best\nsolution is possible and that computer processing power is effortless, rapid, and precise\nfrom the viewpoint of the human programmer. Yet, nothing in the entire algorithm is\nabout human invention; the process is called natural selection (a process occurring in\nnature regardless of the presence of humans) and the flow of the calculations is logical\nor arithmetic (both processes occurring in nature regardless of the presence of\nhumans).Interestingly, algorithms can generate other algorithms; not only precise,\nidentical, multiple copies of themselves but also structured text (i.e. code) that when\nexecuted will behave as an algorithm. In fact, the process of composing an algorithm is\nalso an algorithm in itself, that is, the algorithm that created the algorithm. This self-\n\n31\n\nreferential property (which may be referred to here as meta-algorithm ,i.e. the algorithm\nof an algorithm) is important in design for at least two reasons: first, like algorithms,\ndesign can be seen as a set of procedures that lead stochastically towards the\naccomplishment of a goal. In studying the articulation of algorithms one may be able to\ndiscern similarities with design. While such a study may lead to the development of\nprocedures that may be useful in design, more importantly, it may reveal certain clues\nabout design as a mental process. This possibility opens up a more intricate relationship\nbetween design and algorithm than has been previously possible. Rather than using\nalgorithms to copy, simulate, or replace manual methods of design(while perhaps\ndesirable), instead they can be studied as methodologies that operate in ways similar,\nparallel, or complementary to that of the human mind. Second, along the lines \"we\nmake a tool and the tool makes us\", algorithms can be seen as design tools that lead\ntowards the production of novel concepts, ideas, or forms, which, in turn, have an effect\nin the way designers think thereafter. That way of thinking is incorporated in the next\ngeneration of tools that will, in turn, affect the next generation of designers, and so on.\n\n32\n\n33\n\n3.2 METAMORPHOSIS\n\nDigital modeling software offers a rich repertoire of transfomations a designer could use\nto further explore formal potentialities of an already conceived geometry. Simple,\ntopologically invariant transformations. such as twisting and bending are particularly\neffective means for creating alternative morphologies. For instance, Gehry’s Uslra Oflice\nBuilding in Hanover. Germany (I999), has a simple prismatic form which twists in the\ndirection of the nearby open park area. By adding a fourth. temporal dimension to the\ndeformation processes, animation software adds a possibility to literally express the\nspace and form of an object’s metamorphosis. In keyshape (keyframe) animation.\ndifferent states of an object are located at discrete points in time, and the software then\ncomputes through interpolation a smooth, animated. time-encoded transition between\nthem. A designer could choose one of the interpolated states for further development, or\ncould use the interpolation as an iterative modeling technique to produce instances of\nthe object as it transitions, i.e. morphs from one state to another A particularly\ninteresting temporal modeling technique is morphing, in which dissimilar forms are\nblended to produce a range of hybrid forms that combine formal attributes of the “base“\nand “target” objects. Kolatan and Mac Donald used morphing in their projects. ln\n\"Housing\" a normative three-bedroom two-and-a-half bathroom colonial house was\nused as a \"base\" object that was then morphed into a range of every-day objects as\n\"targets.\" producing a large range of which they call “chimerical\" designs. In that way\nthey digitally blended cross-referenced sectional profiles of common household\nfurniture. such as a bed. sink, sofa, etc. to generate new hibrid forms that establish a\n\"chimerical condition between furniture, space, and surface. Kolatan and Mac Donald\nintentionally employed digital generative processes whose outcomes were “unknown\nand impossible to preconceive or predict \". Other techniques for the metamorphic\ngeneration of form include deformations of the modeling space around an object using a\nbounding box (lattice deformation), a spline curve or one of the coordinate system axes\nor planes, whereby an objects shape conforms to the changes in geometry of the\n\n34\n\nmodeling space. In path animation, for example, an object is deformed as it moves\nalong a selected path.\n\n35\n\n3.3 GENETIC ALGORITHM\n\nThe “rules” that direct the genesis of living organisms, that generate their form, are\nencoded in the strands of DNA. Variation within the same species is achieved through\ngene crossover and mutation, i.c. through the iterative exchange and change of\ninformation that governs the biological morphogenesis.\n\nThe concepts of biological growth and form. i.e. the evolutionary model of nature, can\nbe applied as the generative process for design form as well. Architectural concepts are\nexpressed as a set of generative rules, and their evolution and development can be\ndigitally encoded. The generative script of instructions produces a large number of\n“prototypical forms which are then evaluated on the basis of their performance in a\nsimulated environment.”-\" According to Frazer, the emergent forms are often\nunexpected.\n\nThe key concept behind the evolutionary approach to architecture is that of the genetic\nalgorithm, “a class of highly parallel evolutionary, adaptive search procedures. Their key\ncharacteristic is a “a string-like structure equivalent to the chromosomes of nature,“ to\nwhich the rules of reproduction, gene crossover and mutation are applied. Various\nparameters are encoded into “a string-like structure\" and their values changed, often\nrandomly, during the generative process. A number of similar forms, “pseudoorganisms,\" are generated , which are then selected from the generated populations\nbased on a predefined “fitness” criteria. These \"organisms,\" and the corresponding\nparameter values, are then crossbred, with the accompanying crossovers“ and\n“mutations“ thus passing “beneficial and survival-enhancing traits“. Optimum solutions\nare obtained by small incremental changes over several generations.\n\n36\n\nFor example, architect and designer Karl Chu had approach to digital morphogenesis\nthat is also known as the “proto-bionic\" design, and it is a formal system based on the\ngenerative logic Landermayer system and its implementation in digital modeling\nsoftware, where it is used for the simulation of plant growth. L-systems are based on a\nrecursive rule-based branching system, conceived on the simple technique of rewriting\nin which complex objects are created by successively replacing parts of an initially\nconstructed object using a set of simple rewriting rules. The generative rules of an Lsystem can be very succinctly expressed. A simple set of carefully defined rules can\nproduce a very complex object in a recursive process consisting of only a few levels. In\nboth approaches to generative design based on biological metaphors, the task of the\ndesigner is to define the common source of form, the genetic coding“ for a large family\nof similar objects, in which variety is achieved through different processes of\nreproduction.\n\n37\n\n3.4 ALGORITHM AND ARTIST\n\nGenetic Algorithm is basicly piece of software that is relatively old now, invented in 60\nwhich can mimic evolution ( sort of virtual evolutionary process in the computer). Even\nthough it sounds relatively new, it isn't. But what is new about it is it's utilisation by\nartists. These kind of programs allow us to treat forms like living organisms, to breed\nthem ( like people breed race horses ) through successive generations which are\nprogrammed ( instead of writing the program with head ) they are actually steering the\nevolution. Artist can use the virtual evolutionary process as one more tool, not to\nreplace the others but to add one more visualization to task of creating computer art.\nDeleuze: last years of science, non linear dynamics, fractal theory, chaos theory, theory\nof self-organization and comlexity have demonstrated beyond any doubt is that matter is\nmorphogeneticly charged, that it has power of morphogenesis of their own. And that this\nshould somehow alter the position of an artist to respect the material that he uses. The\nartist can play the role of god oufcourse, where he can have an image or cerebral\nproject of a form he wants to create, and then impose that form on the particular piece\nof material OR the artist can recognize that materials have creative powers of their own\nand enter into the partnership with the materials in the genesis of form.\nExample : Otto Frei\nIt can be applied in art in which artistic element ( the sign element -the brush stroke- the\nbasic form, motives are defined in a computer not by clicking with a mouse but\nprocedurally . This profiles of approach to computer art is now becoming more and\nmore well known in a sense that the software packages themselves come with this\nscripting capability. We can create works of art and then let them selves to performance\nsince every single element of work of art is produced in the computer. It can let self to a\nwider variety of applications than just clicking and drawing a form with a mouse.\n\n38\n\nGenes tease out the form out of the material which have their own morphogenetic\npotential. Complexity can only be teased out of matter in certain ways so if that is\nnecessary in nature, it is clearly necessary in a computer.\nEvolution is automatic search process- the genetic algorithm in computer is classified\nas a search algorithm. Artist many times do searching themselves. They draw several\nvariations or sketches, and they are trying to pick the best one, the fittest one. Gen.\nalgorithm is not going to replace the artist clearly, it is just one more visualization tool to\nincreasingly complex kit of tools that artist uses for creating new forms.\nAlgorithmic design In the world of design, the problems designers are called upon to\nsolve are not necessarily solvable in the traditional sense of finding a path between A\nand B. Apart from specific quantitative localized sub problems that occur within some\nstandardized patterns of construction, the general formal, aesthetic, or planning\nconsiderations are barely addressable as discrete solvable problems. Consequently, it\nmay be more appropriate to use the term problem-addressing rather than problemsolving. Whatever the choice is, an algorithm serves as a means for articulating the\nproblem whether solvable or addressable. More importantly, because of its translational\npower, an algorithm can carry out that articulation one step further and process it using\na computer’s arithmetic and logical power. The combination of both systems, that is,\nthat of the human and that of the computer, is where the true power of algorithms lies.\nAn algorithm is not a game, a cool name, another tool, or an obscure engineers’\nconspiracy but instead it is a way of thinking, and because of its newly introduced\ncounter-part, the computer, it allows human thoughts to extend beyond their limitations.\nBecause design is a way of thinking intrinsically weaved with the most existential human\ncharacteristics, that of logic, artificiality, creativity, and identity, algorithms serve as the\nmeans to explore beyond ,in parallel, or in lieu of traditional established ways of\nthinking. The notion of addressability versus solvability is important in design because it\nallows the algorithms to address a problem offering hints, suggestions, or alternatives\nwhich may never have occurred to the human designer. In such a synergetic\nrelationship the unpredictable, impossible, or unknown are not factors of fear but rather\ninvitations for exploration.\n\n39\n\n40\n\n5.1 3D SCANNING: from physical to digital\n\nFor some designers such as Frank Gehry, the direct tactility of a physical model is a\nmuch preferred way of designing than a “flat' digital manipulation of surfaces on a\ncomputer screen. In Gehry’s case, the digital technologies are not used as a medium of\nconception but as a medium of‘ translation in a process that takes as its input the\ngeometry of the physical model and produces as its output the digitally-encoded control\ninformation which is used to drive various fabrication machines. That means that\ndigital representations of geometry can be used in ways the original physical models\ncannot.\nThe process of translation from the physical to the digital realm is the inverse of\ncomputer-aided manufacturing. From a physical model a digital representation of its\ngeometry can be created using various three-dimensional scanning techniques in a\nprocess often referred to as \"reverse engineering.” A pattern of points called the \"point\ncloud\" is created from the physical model through scanning. and is then interpreted by\nthe conversion software to produce a close approximation of the model’s geometry.\nTypically patterns of scanned points are used to generate profile NURBS (Non-Uniform\nRational B-Splines) curves which are then used to generate lofted NURBS surfaces\n.The resulting surfaces can be compared to the scanned point cloud for an analysis of\ndeviations from the original physical model . A common method for three-dimensional\nscanning involves the use of a digitizing position probe to trace surface features of the\nphysical model. This procedure can be done manually using three-dimensional digitizing\narms or automatically using a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), which has a\ndigitizing position sensor that is mechanically kept in contact with the surface of the\nscanned object. An alternative is to use mm-contact scanning methods which require\nmore expensive scanning devices. but are faster and more accurate, less labor\nintensive and often more effective when scanning small-scale objects. These devices\ncommonly use laser light to illuminate the surface of a scanned object in a step-by-step\nfashion producing patterns of bright dots or lines which ate captured by digital cameras\n(two are often used).\n\n41\n\nThe recorded images are processed using optical recognition techniques to construct\nthe three-dimensional geometric model of the scanned object which can then be\nexported in a desired data format for use in digital analysis or modeling applications.\nThree-dimensional scanning techniques can be used to digitally capture not only the\nphysical models, but also existing or as-built conditions or even entire landscapes.\nLaser scanning technologies. based on different measurement techniques are\ncommonly used in surveying on construction sites worldwide . In each of the different\ndevices\navailable on the market. a laser beam is emitted by the scanner and the reflected beam\nis captured, and its properties analyzed to calculate the distances to the measured\nobject. Four pieces of information are captured for each individual point measurement:\nX, Y and Z coordinates plus the intensity of the reflected beam which can be used to\nassign different light intensities or even colors to the point cloud.\nLaser scanning technologies can create very' accurate three-dimensional models of\nexisting objects . It is conceivable that the laser scanning will also be used to\ncontinuously scan the building's structure as it is erected and to immediately detect\ndeviations from the geometry of digital model. The “point cloud\"\nis already Ill the designers vocabulary and the laser scanning has already rendered the\ntape measure obsolete on numerous design fields.\n\n42\n\n43\n\n5.2 ADDITIVE FABRICATION : from digital to physical\n\nThe use of additive manufacturing technologies for rapid prototyping takes as input\nvirtual computer aided designed models and transforms them into thin, horizontal and\nsuccessive cross-sections in the creation of physical three-dimensional objects .These\nprocesses assume, however, that such objects are geometrically defined without\nnecessarily considering their material makeup and composition . The basic strategy\nbehind additive manufacturing is typically to assign a constant material property to preshaped structural components defined as solids or closed surface polygons.\nFurthermore, both computer aided design tools as well as rapid prototyping processes\nare not set up to represent graduation and variation of properties within solids such as\nvaried density or elasticity. As a result, the design process is constrained to the\nassignment of discrete and homogeneous material properties to a given shape. It is also\ncharacterised by a methodological partition between virtual modelling and physical\nprototyping . Overall, current approaches to virtual and physical prototyping lack the\nability to model and fabricate continuously varying material properties as part of the\nmodelling and production phases respectively, resulting in material waste and\nstructurally non-efficient prototypes.\n\nNatural structures possess a high level of\n\nseamless integration and precision with which they serve their functions. A key\ndistinguishing trait of nature’s designs is its capability in\nthe biological world to generate complex structures of organic, or inorganic,\nmultifunctional composites such as shells, pearls, corals, teeth, wood, silk, horn,\ncollagen, and muscle fibres. Combined with extracellular matrices, these structural\nbiomaterials form microstructures engineered to adapt to prearranged external\nconstraints.\n\nSuch\n\nconstraints\n\ngenerally\n\ninclude\n\ncombinations\n\nof\n\nstructural,\n\nenvironmental and corporeal performance criteria. Since many biological materials are\nmade of fibrous heterogeneous compositions, their multi-functionality is typically\nachieved by mapping performance requirements to strategies of material structuring\n\n44\n\nand allocation. The shape of matter is therefore directly linked to the influences of force\nacting upon it . Material is concentrated in regions of high strength and dispersed in\nareas where stiffness is not required. It is a well-known fact that in nature shape is\ncheaper than material, yet material is cheap because it is effectively shaped,\nheterogeneously distributed, and efficiently structured. Nature’s ability to gradually\ndistribute material properties by way of locally optimizing regions of varied external\nrequirements, such as the bone’s ability to remodel under altering mechanical loads or\nthe wood’s capacity to modify its shape by way of containing moisture is facilitated\nfundamentally by its ability to simultaneously model, simulate and fabricate material\nstructures .The structural properties of wood, for instance, not unlike most biological\nmaterials, can widely vary when measured with the growth grain or against it such that\nits hardness and strength may differ for a given sample as measured in different\norientations . Compared to manmade materials, many natural materials, particularly in\nthe plant kingdom, mechanically outperform some of the most common materials used\nby engineers and architects. Woods have strength per unit weight comparable with that\nof the strongest steels; shell, bone, and antler have toughness an order of magnitude\ngreater than engineering ceramics; and mature bamboo stalks have slenderness ratios\nwhich are remarkable even by the standards of modern engineering . Yet Nature’s\nmaterials are less than half as dense as many of these artificial materials and are\ncharacterized by very low weight and are functional for the plant to sustain . What are\nthe attributes that make natural materials so effective? In The Mechanical Properties of\nNatural Materials, Gibson explores various classes of natural materials in examining the\nrelation between their composite microstructures and their exceptionally high values of\nmechanical performance . The function of these natural materials exploits their\nexceptional structural properties: woods and palms resist bending and buckling, silk\nstores elastic strain energy, muscle stores and releases elastic strain energy during\nlocomotion, and so on. Such relations have significant implications for the design of\nmechanically efficient engineering materials: when considering beams and plates of a\ngiven stiffness or strength, or columns of a given buckling resistance, woods, palms and\nbamboo are among the most efficient materials. Gibson reviews four classes of natural\nmaterials: woods, palm and bamboo, stems and quills. The results of the analyses\n\n45\n\nsuggest novel microstructures for mechanically efficient engineering materials for\nbending stiffness and elastic buckling resistance achieved by optimizing micro-structural\norganization to fit performance requirements such that the cellular structure can\nenhance performance for loading parallel to the . Common to all these examples are the\nexceptional properties of natural materials arising mainly through novel cellular\nmicrostructures that make for efficient engineering materials . Nature’s building blocks\nare therefore not as unique as their structuring in that it is not so much the material\nproperties of the components as their arrangement within the natural composites, which\ngive rise to such a vast range of properties. Thus we may postulate that Material\nStructure is an important design property of natural design as well as a significant body\nof design knowledge. A bio-inspired fabrication approach calls for a shift from shapecentric virtual and physical prototyping to material centric fabrication processes. In this\napproach, not unlike he bones’ re-modeling process , the distribution of material\nproperties is informed by structural and environmental performance criteria acting upon\nthe component, and contributes to its internal physical makeup. It thus requires a set of\nvirtual and physical prototyping tools and methods that support a variable-fabrication\napproach, not unlike Nature’s.\n\nVirtual prototyping\nLayered manufacturing technologies work hand in hand with computer-aided design\n(CAD) software to allow engineers and designers to fabricate their designs. The process\nbegins with a design or a sketch with set geometric parameters. Structural and\nbehavioral characteristics of the design are taken into account by the geometry of the\ndesign from analysis and testing. Before the layered manufactured product is\nprototyped, however, the design must be reproduced in CAD software with all\naccompanying dimensional constraints to be sent out for fabrication. Traditional CAD\nsoftware acts as a translator, converting a design on paper into a design\nunderstandable by a computer. The software application in this project, on the other\nhand, offers features that act as a platform for creative and structural design by allowing\nusers to generate organic forms by mapping the distribution of various material\n\n46\n\nproperties across the expanse of the form. Designs are driven by its properties and\nmaterial behaviors as opposed to its geometry. Layered manufacturing technologies\nhave revolutionized the process of prototyping geometrically complex designs. And yet,\nthe geometric modeling and CAD tools employed for such technologies have remained\nfairly traditional .Current limitations lie in the developments of structural materials for\nfabrication; however, beyond such anticipated improvements, and in light of reported\nadvancements in material engineering, major opportunities lie in the designer’s ability\nwithin the fabrication process to control the variation of material properties as a function\nof external constraints . This requires the re-appropriation of computational tools for\nmodeling, simulation and fabrication. The VPM approach, coupled with the VPRP\ntechnology, makes use of voxel-based graphics methodologies as an alternative\ntemplate for variable property rapid prototyping. Various advantages of this approach\nsuch as elimination of the artificial.STL format, easy accomplishments of tasks like\nestimation of errors in the physical parameters of the fabricated objects, tolerancing,\ninterference detection etc. have been reviewed in the literature . This paper\ndemonstrates an integrated approach to design and manufacturing promoting a direct\nlink between virtual performance-based design and physical prototyping. In the following\nsection we introduce some definitions considered essential to understanding the VPM\napproach and its corresponding VPRP technology, currently under development at MIT\n. Current CAD applications do not support the descriptions of internal material\ncomposition. However, some options exist which employ digital entities capable of\ndescribing micro-scale physical properties of materials and internal composition .\n\nPhysical prototyping\nLayered manufacturing describes a method of manufacturing that uses information from\nCAD files to dissect a design into numerous thin layers and produce the item by\nsuccessively depositing or bonding material to form these unique layers. Layered\nmanufacturing is also known as rapid prototyping as produce time is short and objects\nof varying complexity can be formed without the design and production of a\nmanufacturing system specifically for the object. Some examples of layered\n\n47\n\nmanufacturing include stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), fused\ndeposition modeling (FDM), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), 3D printing, and\nelectron beam melting (EBM). Since materials in layered manufacturing are limited and\nvary with the method used, objects produced from layered manufacturing usually\nundergo various secondary processes. Rapid fabrication (RF) and rapid manufacturing\n(RM technologies have emerged, since the mid 1980s, as promising platforms for\nbuilding construction automation . VPRP defers profoundly from such similar fabrication\ntechnologies in that it aims to produce material organizations of varied properties.\nGenerally classified by the material phase used in their extrusion whether liquid based\n(i.e. stereolithography), powder-based (i.e. selective laser sintering), or solid-based\nprocesses (i.e. fused deposition modeling), consistent to all such technologies is the\nuse of materials with homogeneous properties for prototyping and fabrication purposes.\n\nAdditive fabrication involves incremental forming by adding material in a layer-by-layer\nfashion, in a process which is the converse of milling. It is often referred to as layered\nmanufacturing, solid freeform fabrication, rapid prototyping, or desktop manufacturing.\nAll additive fabrication technologies share the same principle in that the digital (solid)\nmodel is sliced into two-dimensional layers (figure 3.18). The information of each layer\nis then transferred to the processing head of the manufacturing machine and the\nphysical product is generated incrementally in a layer-by-layer fashion.\nSince the first commercial system based on stereolithography was introduced by 3D\nsystems in 1988 a number of competing technologies have emerged on the market,\nutilizing a variety of materials and a range of curing processes based on light heat or\nchemicals.“ Stereolithography (SLA) is based on liquid polymers that solidify when\nexposed to laser light. A laser beam traces a cross-section of the model in a vat of lightsensitive liquid polymer. A thin solid layer is produced in the areas hit by the laser light.\nThe solified pan, which sits on a submerged platform, is then lowered by a small increment into the vat, and the laser beam then traces the next layer, i.e. the cross-section of\nthe digital model. This process is repeated until the entire model is completed. At the\nend of the process, the platform with the solidified model is raised from the vat, and the\n\n48\n\nmodel is then cured to remove extraneous liquid and to give it greater rigidity. In\nSelective Laser Sintering (SL S), the laser beam melts layer by layer of metal powder to\ncreate solid objects. In 3D Printing (3DP), layers of ceramic powder are glued to form\nobjects . Sheets of material (paper or plastic), either precut or on a roll, are glued\n(laminated) together and laser cut in the Laminated Object\n\nManufacture (L OM)\n\nprocess. In Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), each cross-section is produced by\nmelting aplastic filament that solidifies upon cooling. Multi-jet manufacture (MJM) uses a\nmodified printing head to deposit melted thermoplastic wax material in very thin layers,\none layer at a time, to create three-dimensional solids.\n\nIn one of her project in 2010, Neri Oxman have presented her project of the chair that\nhas been completely generated by the CAD systems and fabricated by the 3d printer:\n\nExample :\nThe chaise combines structural, environmental and corporeal performance by adapting\nits thickness, pattern density,stiffness, flexibility and translucency to load, curvature, and\nskin-pressured areas, respectively. A single continuous surface acting both as structure\nand as skin is locally modulated to cater for structural support on the one hand, and\ncorporeal performance on the other. Multiple\nalgorithms were generated that correspond to these variables such that stability is\nmediated with pleasure, and structural integrity with visual and sensual experience. In\nthis light, the chaise celebrates the negotiation between engineering and experiential\nperformance. It is a method, as much as it is an object of pleasure that promotes\nmaterial and structural integrity with the physical act of sitting and\nlying down against a hardsoft surface. The traditional chaise is transformed here to\npromote lounging of a different kind. It is designed as a three dimensional object that\nprovides for multiple seating positions each promoting a completely different\nexperience. The cellular pattern applied to its entirety is designed to increase the ratio of\nsurface area to volume in occupied areas where the body potentially rests. A pressure\nmap study was conducted that matches the softness and hardness of the cells to\ncushion and support sensitive and high-pressured areas. By analyzing anatomical\n\n49\n\nstructures that cause concentrated pressures, the chaise becomes softer and flexible\nwhere pressure needs to be relieved. The relative volume of each cellular cushion is\nlocally informed by pressure data averaged with values\nrepresenting structural support and flexibility. Its density is informed by global and local\nmean curvature values such that denser, smaller cells are organized in areas of steeper\ncurvature whereas larger cells are found in areas of shallow curvature. The chaise’s\nnatural relation of structural and sense datum is propagated in variable polymer\ncomposites offering a wide range of physical properties. Through these\nalgorithms force conditions naturally propagate functionality. Stiffer materials are\npositioned in surface areas under compression and softer, more flexible materials are\nplaced in surface areas under tension. State of the art technologies are applied here for\nthe first time to cater for a large range of physical properties and behaviours. The\nsurface patches are 3D printed using a new multi-jet matrix technology\nsimultaneously depositing materials of different properties corresponding to structural\nand skin-pressure mappings. The traditional chaise is transformed to promote lounging\nof a different kind. By analyzing anatomical structures that cause concentrated\npressures, the chaise becomes softer and flexible where pressure needs to be relieved.\nThe relative volume of each cellular cushion is locally informed by pressure data\naveraged with values representing structural support and flexibility. Its density is\ninformed by global and local mean curvature values such that denser, smaller cells are\norganized in areas of steeper curvature whereas larger cells are found in areas of\nshallow curvature.\nThe chaise’s natural relation of structural and sense datum is propagated in variable\npolymer composites offering a wide range of physical properties.

State of the art technologies are applied here for\nthe first time to cater for a large range of physical properties and behaviours.\n\n50\n\n51\n\n5. 3 MASS-CUSTOMIZATION\n\nThe ability to mass-produce one-off, highly differentiated building components with\nthe same facility as standardized parts. introduced the notion of \"mass-customization\"\ninto building design and production (it is just as easy and cost-efective for a CNC milling\nmachine to produce l,000 unique objects as to produce l,000 identical ones).\n\nAlmost every segment of the economy. and industrial production in particular. has been\naffected by mass-customization, sometimes in very radical ways. Levi’s, for example,\noffers customized jeans, manufactured from body measurements taken by a scanner in\none of its stores at a cost slightly more than a standard pair. Motorola’s Paging Products\nGroup lets its customers design their own pagers by choosing the desired frequency,\ntone, color, software, clips and other components (more than 29 million combinations\nare possible), and sells them at the same cost as their ofi'-the-shelf predecessors. In\nJapan, Panasonic sells bicycles that are built to individual rider‘s measurements, with\ncustomized color combinations and other options (with some ll million possible\nvariations), creating truly mass-produced, built-to-fit, i.c. mass-customized machines.\nMass customization is a particularly suitable production paradigm for the building\nindustry, since buildings are mostly one-off, highly customized products. A “custom”\nhouse will become available to a broader segment of society. Eventually, the technologies and “customization” methods that are developed in the consumer products industry\nwill be applied to products as well. ln furniture industry, individual components could be\nmass-customized to allow for optimal variance in response to differing needs .The\ndigitally-driven production processes will introduce a different logic of seriality in\narchitecture and design, one that is based on local variation and differentiation in series.\nlt is now possible to produce “series-manufactured, mathematically coherent but\ndilferentiated objects, as well as elaborate, precise and relatively cheap one-off\ncomponents.\n\n52\n\nMass customization is the new frontier in business competition for both manufacturing\nand service industries. At its core is a tremendous increase in variety and customization\nwithout a corresponding increase in costs. At its limit, it is the mass production of\nindividually customized goods and services. At its best, it provides strategic advantage\nand economic value.\n\n.\n\n53\n\n54\n\n6. CONCLUSION\n\nOriginally the role of computers in design was to replicate human endeavors and to take\nthe place of humans in the design process. Later the role shifted to create systems that\nwould be intelligent assistants to designers, relieving them from the need to perform the\nmore trivial tasks and augmenting their decision-making capabilities. Today, the roles of\ncomputers vary from drafting and modeling to form-based processing of architectural\ninformation. While the future of computers appears to include a variety of possible roles,\nit is worth exploring these roles in the context provided by the question: “Who designs?”\nIf one takes the position that designing is note exclusively a human activity and that\nideas exist independently of human beings, then it would be possible to design a\ncomputational mechanism which would associate those ideas.\n“nothing comes out of nothing and nothing disappears into nothing” which, if true,\nsignifies an inability to achieve something out of nothing, i.e. to create something new.\n\nNature\n\nIn previous chapters it was shown how Nature’s basic rule of selection can be combined\nwith computers in order to get an answer to different questions that start with: “What is\nthe optimal . . . ”. It will be useful to turn shortly to the forms generated in Nature in\norder to draw some parallels between natural and artificial structures. Direct comparison\nwould not be an easy task, since the fitness functions in structural design of objects and\nliving creatures can be quite different In deployable structures, GAs can be used as\neffectively, but the fitness functions would become more complex, and that is something\nthat will surely be a part of future research. That will be another step forward to getting\ncloser to the Nature’s engineering skills and aesthetics.\n\n55\n\nNatura non facit saltus\n\nA very important characteristic of our natural environment is suitably summed up in:\nNature does not make a leap. Nature doesn’t know anything, it tries. Each and every\none of its creations is influenced by a large number of factors from its environment, and\ntherefore basically randomly (accidentally) altered. Natural selection preserves the\nbetter design and relies on inheritance. Now the big question is, whether we have\nsurpassed Nature and do not use any random alteration, or whether our comprehensive\nknowledge and intelligence is just an illusion and we are basically using the same\nprinciple of inheritance? We rely on what we know and then try something new with\nsmall alterations, thus probably mistaking all the accumulated skills from the beginning\nof mankind for an illusion of conscious and comprehensive thinking. The basic principle\nof cell division at the microlevel, shows how every cell in Nature has its own centroid\naccording to which it tries to define its form. The geometry is then influenced by its size\nand strength (material properties) and by the neighbouring particles and their centroid\nand volume.\n\nThe Future\nUp until the recent past, FEM analysis of any structure was a complicated task that\nneeded lots of preparation and calculation time. Today, with the exponential growth of\nthe processor speed, not only can we calculate complicated structures in a matter of\nseconds, but we can create an iterative process that can do that millions of times.\nIn those iterative algorithms the future of structural design is being born. As mentioned\nbefore, our part will only be to ask the question right, and the answer will be given by a\n\n56\n\nmachine. It is irrelevant what kind of optimization algorithms will be used, but for now\nthe stochastic ones, like Genetic Algorithms, promise a lot. One of the main reasons is\ntheir generality, i.e., applicability to practically any optimization problem. It was proven\nthat, if they are set properly, they can be extremely efficient. Most of the possible\napplications of the merger of graphics and static analysis have not yet been\ninvestigated, and surely offer solutions beyond our imagination. It opens up huge\npossibilities, and represents the future of structural and formal design. Many procedures\nperformed by designers and engineers manually, can now be automatized. Computers\ncan be used to generate thousands or millions of possible combinations and solutions,\nsomething that we as human beings could never process. The only thing that we have\nto do is ask the question properly (which is not an easy task!) and then we can use\ndifferent optimization methods to get the answers. As mentioned before, a large effort\nwill be directed toward smart, parametric solution of the joint geometry. Parallel to that,\nnew materials have to be tested and applied in the structural design.\n\nAs far as the optimization of product design object's structures with the use of Genetic\nAlgorithms goes, this is just the beginning. Every single aspect of the application written\nis made in a way that it can be expanded easily. For example, the coding and decoding\npart can be altered to comprehend any kind of 3D structure. We can imagine an\noptimization of the structure for the entire free-formed skyscraper, or even an\noptimization of the fiber and molecular structure in materials (with the further\ndevelopment on nanotechnology). This can be done with simple alterations of the\npresented method. Deployable structures are becoming more popular, and with the\nproper set of dynamic fitness functions we can generate beautiful and efficient biostructures, that will be able to transform and adjust to the environment conditions, as\nwell as plants or animals can. The tools that we have today are slowly starting to get\nahead of us. Breakthroughs in science are challenging our imagination every day.\nBuckminster Fuller wrote about new inventions and how they have to wait 50 years until\nthey get applied in the fabrication process. I think that time-span is getting shorter and\nshorter now. New generations of designers and engineers, that have to know\n\n57\n\nprogramming languages as well as they know mathematics or art history, are being\neducated right now. The future of design is in their hands.\n\nAnd as for the conclusion, i would like to share the article from The Economist\nmagazine ( april 21st, 2012 ), in order to clarify the future idea of mass customization\nand it's direct relation to computer aided creation and fabrication:\n\" The third industrial evolution\"\nTHE first industrial revolution began in Britain in the late 18th century, with the\nmechanisation of the textile industry. Tasks previously done laboriously by hand in\nhundreds of weavers' cottages were brought together in a single cotton mill, and the\nfactory was born. The second industrial revolution came in the early 20th century, when\nHenry Ford mastered the moving assembly line and ushered in the age of mass\nproduction. The first two industrial revolutions made people richer and more urban. Now\na third revolution is under way. Manufacturing is going digital. As this week's special\nreport argues, this could change not just business, but much else besides.\nA number of remarkable technologies are converging: clever software, novel materials,\nmore dexterous robots, new processes (notably three-dimensional printing) and a whole\nrange of web-based services. The factory of the past was based on cranking out zillions\nof identical products: Ford famously said that car-buyers could have any colour they\nliked, as long as it was black. But the cost of producing much smaller batches of a wider\nvariety, with each product tailored precisely to each customer's whims, is falling. The\nfactory of the future will focus on mass customization—and may look more like those\nweavers' cottages than Ford's assembly line.\nThe old way of making things involved taking lots of parts and screwing or welding them\ntogether. Now a product can be designed on a computer and “printed” on a 3D printer,\nwhich creates a solid object by building up successive layers of material. The digital\ndesign can be tweaked with a few mouse clicks. The 3D printer can run unattended,\nand can make many things which are too complex for a traditional factory to handle. In\n\n58\n\ntime, these amazing machines may be able to make almost anything, anywhere—from\nyour garage to an African village.\nThe applications of 3D printing are especially mind-boggling. Already, hearing aids and\nhigh-tech parts of military jets are being printed in customized shapes. The geography\nof supply chains will change. An engineer working in the middle of a desert who finds he\nlacks a certain tool no longer has to have it delivered from the nearest city. He can\nsimply download the design and print it. The days when projects ground to a halt for\nwant of a piece of kit, or when customers complained that they could no longer find\nspare parts for things they had bought, will one day seem quaint.\nOther changes are nearly as momentous. New materials are lighter, stronger and more\ndurable than the old ones. Carbon fibre is replacing steel and aluminium in products\nranging from aeroplanes to mountain bikes. New techniques let engineers shape\nobjects at a tiny scale. Nanotechnology is giving products enhanced features, such as\nbandages that help heal cuts, engines that run more efficiently and crockery that cleans\nmore easily. Genetically engineered viruses are being developed to make items such as\nbatteries. And with the internet allowing ever more designers to collaborate on new\nproducts, the barriers to entry are falling. Ford needed heaps of capital to build his\ncolossal River Rouge factory; his modern equivalent can start with little besides a laptop\nand a hunger to invent.\nLike all revolutions, this one will be disruptive. Digital technology has already rocked the\nmedia and retailing industries, just as cotton mills crushed hand looms and the Model T\nput farriers out of work. Many people will look at the factories of the future and shudder.\nThey will not be full of grimy machines manned by men in oily overalls. Many will be\nsqueaky clean—and almost deserted. Some carmakers already produce twice as many\nvehicles per employee as they did only a decade or so ago. Most jobs will not be on the\nfactory floor but in the offices nearby, which will be full of designers, engineers, IT\nspecialists, logistics experts, marketing staff and other professionals. The manufacturing\njobs of the future will require more skills. Many dull, repetitive tasks will become\nobsolete: you no longer need riveters when a product has no rivets.\n\n59\n\n60\n\nREFERENCES :\n- Antoine Picon Culture numérique et architecture .
