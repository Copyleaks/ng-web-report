At that time I attempted to designa paperboard dwelling system in which -significantly varied structural configurations could be assembléd from a minimum number of types of mass-produced components. This project was a brief design effort involving a couple of scale models, which were unsuccessful in both their modular and their structural effectiveness. The general problem seemed to me even then to be extremely important; however, the course of my life was such that the idea slipped back into my unconscious for a number of years. As time passed, and I became inspired by the work of Charles Eames, Konrad Wachsmann, Buckminster Fuller, and D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, the problem gradually reemerged; and it became the basis of a serious and extensive investigation in 1965 when I was awarded aresearch fellowship by the Graham Foundation for a study of \"Structurally Autonomous, Geometrically Adaptable Cellular Systems.\" At that time, I knew virtually nothing about geometry, ar)d in particular about polyhedra and the related ideas which are the primary subject of this book. lt was uphill from there. The main themes of this book are: a systematic and, I hope, a comprehensive study of three-dimensional spatial systems; a theory of their interrelationships; and the possibilities for the application of such systems-or at least some of them-to structural and architectural design. I imagine that the book will find its greatest use amongst designers and architects. Yet the work presents a novel application of concepts usually only met with in the sciences; furthermore, a good part of it is devoted to concrete visualizations-by way of photographs of models -{)f structures dealt with more abstractly by scientists, who usually speak a mathematical parlance accessible only to initiates. Whether my variations on the theme of space-filling will have some application in the physical sciences I cannot say. Yet perhaps the visualizations contained herein may hold some interest for mathematicians, biologists, physicists, chemists, and, especially, crystallographers.\n \n X\n \n The form of the presentation in this book stems from a strong empírica! bias; hence, geometry is approached in a deliberately concrete way. By virtue of this approach, readers without mathemi:üical backgrounds should be able to follow the development of the subject. At the same time, I hope that my presentation will withstand the scrutiny of readers trained in mathematics and science. I have attempted to create a book that is self-contained, so that the development of ideas can be followed without the use of outside references. However, nume~ous references are given for the serious student of morphology and geometry. Although they have expanded into more comprehensive systems, most of the concepts presented in this book were described in preliminary form in a report to the Graham Foundation in the fali of 1966, entitled \"Synestructics, the Study of Universal Structure.\" Since \"practical application\" has been an important emphasis in my work, and since many proprietary inventions have evolved as part of this work, a company was founded in 1970, called Synestructics, Inc., to pursue the \"reduction to practice\" of such inventions. Although Synestructics, Inc. is not currently applying these ideas and inventions on an architectural scale, it is gradually moving in that direction and will accelerate its p.ctivity in that area as sufficient capital becomes available for development. The ultimate corporate goal of Synestructics, Inc. isto be fully engaged in the business of producing architectural systems. In the meantime, the company has introduced a line of \"geometrical\" educational toys and games, and playground equipment inc! uding \"SuperStructures,\" \"NetResults,\" \"Curved Space,\" ''TetraKite,\" \"SuperTetraKite,\" \"Sky Links Kite System,\" \"PuzzlePatterns,\" \"SnowCrystals,\" \"Great Shapes,\" and \"Rhombones: Better Blocks.\" Ali of these products are available in toy stores and through some educational distributors as well as directly from Synestructics, Inc. This book does not describe these products directly with the exception of SuperStructures® which is identified as the Universal Node® system in this book, and Curved Space (which exists as both a geometric toy and a large scale recreational environment), which is an application of systems descrrbed herewith as saddle polyhedra and continuous surfaces.\n \n xi\n \n I mention these products here because they ali represent three-dimensional visualizations and realizations of concepts that are often difficult to understand in the abstract or even with the help of illustrations. Those who find this book of interest may find some of these products useful. I owe thanks to many people who, during the course of my investigations and the preparation of this book, offered their encouragement, inspiration, and technical assistance. I would first like to thank the Graham Foundation and its former director, John Entenza, for awarding me a fellowship in 1965 for the initial research and a g rant in 1968 to prepare some further material towards the completion of this book. Konrad Wachsmann, Buckminster Fui ler, and Charles Eames provided both inspiration and direct encouragement, and for this I am most grateful. Most recently the completion of this book was supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington,\n \n D.C. I would like to thank Alan Schoen for his enthusiastic interest in my work, for his lively and inspired conversation, and for his helpful clarification of certain mathematical concepts. I am indebted to both Arthur Loeb and Edwin Schlossberg, not only for their continuing interest in my work, but also for their criticai review of and constructive suggestions for the original manuscript; and to Arthur Loeb and Gyorgy Kepes for bringing my work to the attention of the MIT Press. For their co IIective assistance in model building, illustration, photography, and other technical areas, I would also like to thank Robert Brooks, Roger Conrad, Toby Cowan, Robert Fui ler, Mark Jurey, and Steve Selkowitz. I would also like to thank the many individuais and institutions-listed in the Photo and Picture Credits-who supplied the beautiful photographs of structure in nature which appear in Chapter 2. Special gratitude is also dueto Keto Soosaar for his enthusiastic appreciation of my work, and for his encouragement resulting from ourongoing discussions of the implications and validity of specific structural system applications. I also owe him thanks for his contribution of the Curved Space structural analysis as reported in Chapter 14.\n \n Preface and Acknowledgments\n \n Finally, and most importantly, I would like to thank my wife, Susan, who not only built hundreds of models of ali kinds, did a large percentage of the inking of the drawings, and helped me with the photography, but also typed the manuscript and contributed extensively to its preparation and editing. Without her dedication and extensive help, the completion of this book would plainly not have been possible.\n \n Systems for Diversity\n \n I ntroduction\n \n Man's successful fit into the bui lt environment depends on the possibi lities for change and adaptation within a context of conservative resource use. Such possibilities are a function of diversity and efficiency of form, and such diversity of form can enhance man's relationship to his environment. Technological man's pervasive reliance upon standardized undifferentiated form minimizes the possibility for diversity.\n \n In [1.1] I show a geometric scheme that exemplifies the minimum inventory I maximum diversity concept. Four geometric modules, A, B, C, and D, combine into basic (cellular) units, which in turn form endless varieties by combination and permutation. Although this demonstration is only diagrammatic, it begins to illustrate the range of diversity that can be generated from a kit of standardized components.\n \n The work presented in this book attempts to provide a basis for a rapprochement between the principie of standardization and the need for diversity and change in envirbnmental structures. When properly used, the principie of component standàrdization is a system of g reat production and distribution efficiency; it can also be a system which conserves natural resources. In a fundamental way, standardization is a principie of modularity. We need to develop a building strategy with which diversity and change can be accomplished by modular systems which are efficient in their use of natural material and energy resources. Systems can be envisaged which consist of some minimum inventory of component types which can be alternatively combined to yield a great diversity of efficient structural form. We cal i these minimum inventory/maximum diversity systems. By such a \"system\" I mean a minimized inventory of component types (a kit of parts) along with rubrics whereby the components may be combined. In the best systems, as we shall see, the rubrics lead not to constriction, but to a maximization of different, though generically related, structural forms. We wi li uncover such rubrics by considering the properties of space-of form itself. One characteristic of successful systems wi li be that the rubrics-the rules of assemblageand the physical components themselves will be seen to be organically related: the rules will be seen to grow out of the parts, the parts out of the rules. How different from so much of contemporary architecture's divorce of material and method!\n \n xii\n \n 1.1 A minimum inventory/maximum diversity system.\n \n Structure in Nature In an attempt to understand the concept of minimum inventory/maximum diversity systems we are drawn to nature~ Consider the vast number of substances formed by the combinations and permutations of a relatively small number of chemical elements. There are innumerable other examples in nature of form and structure which are generated from the combinations of physically as well as chemically different components.\n \n 1.2 Snowflakes exhibit great diversity of form, governed by certain physical, geometrical, and chemical constraints.\n \n The snowflake is a most graphic example in nature of the minimum inventory I maximum diversity principie. In fact, it may be considered an archetype of physicogeometric expression. Ali planar snow crystals are found to have star-like forms with six corners (or subsets thereof). More specifically, they have the symmetry of a regular hexagon. However, within this six-fold form, no two snowflakes have ever been known to be exactly alike. Figure [1.2] shows 37 different snowflakes (Bentley and Humphreys, 1962). The form ranges from very simple and delicate stellate structures through complex filigreelike configurations to bold and relatively massive hexagonal plates. Not only are they ali six-sided, but only certain angular relationships occur in these symmetrically branching structures. lt is interesting to note that each individual snowflake exh i bits a high degree. of differentiation within its own form. This variety of pattern which occurs across the face of each individual crystal further emphasizes the minimum inventory/maximum diversity principie. The molecular structure of the snowflake is the building system by which this infinite diversity is generated. This building system consists of Cl')rtain physical, geometrical, and chemical constraints (rubrics) which govern the form options. The variety of the snowflake results from a least-energy interaction of its \"kit of parts\" with the environmental conditions of temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and atmospheric pressure under which it is formed.\n \n xiii\n \n lntroduction\n \n Crystal structures, in general, demonstrate diversity of form as a function of the least-energy internai arrangements of their atomic arrays. In biological structures, the DNA molecule suggests a minimum inventory/maximum diversity principle-although a complex one, with less dependence on physicogeometric constraints than on biochemical interactions. Forms in nature are always generated by structures in nature, and a characteristic range of diversity and differentiation is exhibited within the combinatorial limits of a particular formative process. In the present work we are concerned primarily with these aspects of structure in nature which manifest themselves in terms of physicogeometric phenomena (built form), since architectural structure operates by definition in this realm. A large part of the form determinants of crystal structures can be characterized as physicogeometric phenomena. Because of this, the relàtionship of crystals to building structures is more apparent than is the case with biological structures.\n \n lt can be readily seen that the principie of closest packing is equivalent to that of triangulation, and it is well known that triangulated frameworks exhibit inherent geometric stabi lity. Such properties enable framework structures to be built without moment joints, insuring axially loaded members; and this in turn results in high strength-per-weight minimum-energy structures. Planar and domical structures have taken advantage of triangulation for a number of years; the first truly threedimensional triangulated structures were probably Alexander Graham Bell's tetrahedral kites and space frames. The principie of closest packing/triangulation is one of remarkable universality. lt operates independently of scale or materiais, with the same energetically conservative effect. Whether at the molecular levei, the cellular levei, or at the man-made structural levei, its inherent stability always establishes a condition of minimullil potential energy. ·\n \n An integral part of the concept of minimum inventory/maximum diversity systems is the principie of conservation of resources. The formative processes in natural structure are clíaracteristically governed by least-energy responses. Perhaps the simplest expression of this is found in the principie of closest packing, a principie which even in its most elementary form is common in both the animate and inanimate worlds.\n \n That nature creates forms and structures according to the requirements of minimum energy is perhaps the most pervasive theme throughout D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's beautiful work, On Growth and Form. Thompson describes~ how nature, as a response to the action of force, creates a great diversity of forms from an inventory of basic principies. \"In short, the form of an object is a diagram of forces; in this sense, at least, that from it we can judge of or deduce the forces that are acting or have acted upon it; in this strict and particular sense, it is a diagram.\" (Thompson 1:16). We canassume that in this creation of form, nature's responses to force action tend to fulfill the conditions of minimum energy. Form as a diagram of forces is an important governing idea in the application of the minimum inventory/maximum diversity principie to building system design. lf a building system can be considered analogous to a molecular structure which is highly responsive to varied actions of force, it may offer the real possibility of generating building forms responsive to the human needs and natural requirements of diversity, adaptation, change, and the conservative use of hatural resources. In arder to facilitate a design strategy I have attempted an elaboration on the concept of force. A force may be considered as any factor which may act from within or from without to determine any given form. The form of any structure is determined by the interaction of two fundamental classes offorces: (1) intrinsic forces, and (2) extrinsic forces. lntrinsic forces are those governing factors which are inherent in any particular structural system; that is, the internai properties of a system which govern its possible arrangements and its potential performance. In the case of ou r archetypal snow crystals, the intrinsic force system would be its molecular structure which governs the nature or character of its infinitely varied patterns.\n \n Closest packing is a structural arrangement of inherent geometric stability that finds expression in the three-dimensional arrangement of polyhedral cells in biological systems as well as in the dense arrangement of spherical atoms in the structure of certain metais. lf the centers of closest packed equal spheres are joined, a three-dimensional arrangement of equilateral triangles is formed. lf the centers of closest packed polyhedral cells in a biological structure are joined through shared faces, a triangulated configuration will also result.\n \n xiv\n \n Form as a Diagram of Forces\n \n lntroduction\n \n Extrinsic forces are those governing influences which are externai to any particular structural system. They are the inventory of factors, largely environmental, which give direction to the form options allowed by the inherent combinatorial or formgiving properties of a given structural system. The extrinsic forces in our snowflake example wol,Jid be those specific environmental factors of temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and atmospheric pressure which interact with the molecular structure to synthesize form. Ali forms in nature are determined by the interaction of intrinsic with extrinsic forces. The snowflake typifies ali crystalline orderings. The possible externai . shape options that a given crystal may take are controlled by the internai symmetry of the atomic arrangement; that is, by the system with which the atoms themselves are arranged. The particular local form of a given crystal is determined by the interaction of externai environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) with the inherent principies governing the atomic arrangements. A given crystalline substance may take a variety of shapes; but certain limits to form, usually expressed as angular relationships, are governed by the inherent form-giving properties (the intrinsic force system) of the atomic arrangement [1.3].\n \n The ínteraction of intrinsic and extrinsic forces to produce form in nature are relatively comprehensible for the case of inanimate crystals, as the interactions tend to be domínated by physícogeometric phenomena. The process is much more complex and elusive as one examines biological form and structure. The division between intrinsic and extrinsic forces is not always clear and tends to be hierarchical. That is, at one scale a force may be considered extrinsic, but in a larger context, the same force may become intrinsic. This hierarchical phenomenon exists for both inanimate and animate structures. For example, a given molecular structure may constitute an intrinsic force system that contrais the options of possible crystalline cell shapes when they are in association with other cells, and the environment formed by the contiguous cells is the extrinsic force that determines which particular option a cell shape may take. The interaction of the extrinsic environmental force with the intrinsic molecular force determines the shapes of the cells in an array. This array of cell shapes then becomes an intrinsic force system that contrais the possible shape options of a larger form that reflects still another levei of extrinsic force [1.4]. Each successive levei of structure is the environment (extrinsic force system) for the preceding levei (intrinsic force system). This process can apparently progress ad infinitum. In the creation of the man-made environment extrinsic forces can be considered the design goals-the various criteria, be they whimsical, philosophical, esthetic, or performance-oríented, that may be imposed upon the designed form. lntrinsic forces in the design of the man-made e'nvironment can be considered the \"stateof-the-art\" technologies and the limitations of their use governed by the levei of skill and perceptions available and by the dogma of habit and bias that may prevail.\n \n 1.3 Externai form dictated by the allowable packings of internai modular elements.\n \n xv\n \n lntroduction\n \n 1.4 A hierarchy of intrinsic and extrinsic forces. The hexagonal shape represents an extrinsic response at the lowest levei; at higher leveis of organization, the hexagonal cell can itself be viewed as an intrinsic determinant of the larger form.\n \n In the present design context, the intrinsic force systems avai lable do not appear to be capable of anything approaching an optimum response to the complexity of extrinsic forces now évident in the manmade environment. The minimum inventory/maximum diversity principieis an attempt to develop a design strategy which embodies an intrinsic force system capable of effective responses to the environmental circumstances which now prevail and will continue to prevail in the future. Such environmental circumstances suggest the following summary of the concept of extrinsic forces as it relates specifically to the design of bui lding systems. The influences which are externai to the inherent properties of a form-giving (building) system constitute a set of extrinsic forces andare the criteria for the creation of building form. These extrinsic forces include: (a) prevailing environmental conditions of temperature, wind, humidity, earth-sun geometry, and their variations;* (b) limitations of resources including energy and materiais; (c) topographical conditions; (d) geological conditions; (e) building function including the change of its use over time; (f) relationship to the community; and (g) emotional ambience. *For abri lliant discussion of the response of different building forms to the stresses of environmental variation and how to optimize form to minimize the need for supportive maintenance energy, see Knowles.\n \n xvi\n \n The anticipation of effective building form as a response to these extrinsic forces suggests the following summary of intrinsic forces: a given building system embodies a set of intrinsic forces which determines the inherent properties of the system. These inherent properties include the building system's ability to: (a) con- . form to arrangements of minimum potential energy, i.e., structural efficiency relative to use of materiais; (b) provi de diversity of form in order to respond (adapt) optimally to the actions of an array of extrinsic forces; (c) accommodate change in response to the inevitable long term variations of certain extrinsic forces; (d) define a minimum inventory of component types in order to simplify and economize the production and use of the system; (e) take advantage of materiais that are consistent with an optimum response to the actions of extrinsic forces and to the economical producti~n of the system's components; and (f) make use of production methods that allow components to be produced economically. Although the development of sophisticated means by which to analyze extrinsic forces relevant to building design is extremely important (see Knowles), our present concern is the development of a sophisticated and responsive intrinsic force system. Successful design solutions are not possible without the appropriate interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic forces. The field of environmental design has been preoccupied with considerations of design criteria (extrinsic forces) to the neg lect of the i nherent properties of systems (intrinsic forces) and their implications for creating adaptive form. The present work assumes that the ability to respond effectively to the actions and stresses of extrinsic forces has as a prerequisite an understanding of a theory of intrinsic forces, and that intrinsic force systems do not inherently follow from criteria derived from an analysis of extrinsic forces.\n \n lntroduction\n \n Any environment for human use organizes and distributes energy in various forms. Crystalline material, gases, and liquids are ali juxtaposed in a system which exists in three-dimensional space. lt matters little what a given spatial complex may look like, be it formally \"geometric\" or be it amorphously \"organic\"-its stnJcture is still a matter of physical and geometric relationships. lt must work in three-dimensional physical space. Structure in nature suggests that there must be some fundamental principies and laws, an intrinsic force system, which can form the basis for the design of minimum inventory/maximum diversity building systems. lt must be possible to understand the fundamental and comprehensive phenomena which govern the adaptive form-giving potential of modular systems in three-dimensional physical space. Since modularity implies order and order implies symmetry, the intelligibility of a theory of modular structure will depend on an understanding of the extent to which principies of symmetry govern modular order in three-dimensional space. In addition to an understanding of the general nature of modular structure, specific physical characteristics of particular modular arrangements must be evaluated with respect to their structural efficiency in terms of energy utilization.\n \n An lntegrative Morphology\n \n Whether they are atoms, spheres, cells, linear members, or surfaces, the components of a physical system have specific size, weight, and shape. The possible ways in which such physical components can fit together into alternative structures are governed by physicogeometrical laws of symmetry. Although such laws can be described mathematically by the abstract relationship of points and lines in space, our present concern calls for a morphológical approach in which the elements of modular structures are represented i.n terms of built form.\n \n I~\n \n Since our concern is a system from which useful building forms can be assembled, we must look at the fundamental principies governing spatial differentiation and enclosure in three dimensions. Any volume which encloses space or which differentiates two or more regions of space can be formed by a collection of surface modules, i.e., polygons. Since any polygon can be defined by a closed framework, i.e., a circuit of edges, any volume can be ;minimally described as a framework. For example, a cube is composed of six square faces, each of which can be defined by a four-sided trame. The entire cube can be defined by and assembled from twelve linear components or branches. I could go on to give innumerable examptes of both finite systems like the cube, or infinite systems like a packing of cubes, ali of which can be defined as some kind of modular framework or network. The requirement of providing for diversity of form suggests that a comprehensive inventory of orderly and fundamental spatial alternatives represented by both finite and infinite networks would be useful, particularly since the state-of-the-art building design approaches exhibit an intrinsic force system dominated by an orthogonal spatial bias.\n \n xvii\n \n There can be no doubt that cube oriented geometry is extremely important and relevant to architectural design; however, it has serious modular limitations with respect to the generation of diversity of form, and as a structural framework it has inferior strength-to-weight properties when compared to triangulated systems. The inclusion of orthogonal geometry as an element in a broader view of spatial relationships in three-dimensional structures, ratherthan as the dominant principie, is bound to increase the inventory of options. Even chi ldren of kindergarten age know that cubes can be packed together to fi li space. At this early age a fundamental spatial bias is imposed which is pervasive in Western culture. Virtually ali examples of architecture consisting of aggregates of volumetric units, i.e., rooms, demonstrate this bias. lt is fairly rare that we actually see true cubes, but how many buildings have been built in which rooms are not defined or enclosed by four vertical and two horizontal surfaces, ali disposed at 90° to one another? Most of our cities utilize some form of rectangular grid for the plan of their streets. Cartesian coordinates are a boon to mensuration, it is true, but does it follow (particularly in the age of the computer, when calculations in nonorthogonal coordinates take hardly more time than those in rectangular coordinates) that designers must constrain their forms to the shape of the coordinates upon which they are erected? As we shall see, reliance upon the 90° angle as a basis for organizing space imposes extremely limited means to reach our goal of maximum diversity and minimum inventory. A cursory observation of natural structures shows that cubes rarely occur. This alone suggests that a careful st~dy of other alternatives is advisable. As an inventory of form options is assembled consisting of simple finite polyhedra, through polyhedral symmetrical spacefilling systems, to a broader class of infinite periodic three-dimensional networks, and beyond, it becomes increasing ly clea,r that the fui fi llment of the minimum inventory/maximum diversity principie depends upon the possibility of understanding the interrelatedness of an inventory of alternatives.\n \n lntroduction\n \n The possible common relationship among such alternatives has been explored and developed into an integrative morphological strategy. lt is an integrative strategy because it enables entire inventaries of systems to be generated as combinations and permutations of common sets of elements, and it is a morphological strategy because it is primarily a concrete physical embodiment of the inherent principies of symmetry and geometry which govern modular order in three-dimensional space rather than an abstract mathematical description of such principies. With this morphological approach, threedimensional ordering principies in nature can be understood in a direct empirical and sensorially apprehended way. As morphological embodiments of inherent modular principies, such a strategy not only constitutes intrinsic force systems, but can be both physical model systems and architectural building systems as well. Rather than attempt to set up \"architectural\" criteria for the discovery of such new spatial possibilities, it is far more useful to establish as our goal a knowledge of ali the possibilities for the orderly subdivision, modulation, structuring, and enclosing of space. We have to be prepared to pursue a course of study which may, at times, seem remote indeeél from the creation of improved environments for human use. Yet in the end this path will prove to have been the best, for conclusions drawn from a partial study of space or from a study of space guided by popular experience or assumed technical and engineering limitations cannot uncover fundamental and radical improvements.\n \n The Platonic Solids. Triangulation and Geometric Stability\n \n 1 as\n \n Geometry\n \n Plato was apparently the first person to attempt a geometrical description of structure in nature. He also explored the possibility of developing an inventory of basic geometric shapes (in this case, right triangles) which could be recombined to form the five regular polyhedra* [1.1 ]. Plato's Timaeus contains a detailed account for constructing four of the regular solids from two types of triang les, identifying the four solids with the four elements: the tetrahedron represented fire; the cube, earth; the octahedron, ai r; and the icosahedron, water. Apparently it did not disturb Plato that the pentagonal dodecahedron could not be formed with his basic triangles. The dodecahedron became for him the shape which envelops the entire universe. These five regular polyhedra became known as the Platonic solids (Benfy and Fikes 1966; Burke 1966). The five Platonic solids are the only convex polyhedra that are bounded by identical regular polygonal faces in which ali vertices are equivalent.\n \n Structure\n \n The triangle is the only polygon that is stable (rigid) by virtue of its geometry. This can be readi ly demonstrated by the construction of a triangular frame joined at its vertices with hingeable connectors. *Apolygon is a finite connected set of line\n \n segments which are joined to each other at their ends such that a closed circuit is formed consisting of edges (sides) and corners (vertices). lf the vertices are ali coplanar a plane polygon is formed; if not, a skew polygon is formed. A polygon is equilateral if its sides are ali equal, and equiangular if the interior angles formed at each vertex are ali equal. A plane polygon is considered regular if it is both equilateral and equiangular. A polyhedron is a volume bounded by plane surfaces. lt may be considered a finite connected set of plane polygons forming a closed volumetric figure, such that each si de of every polygon is shared with one other polygon, and that the sides of these polygons intersect at their ends in groups of three or more to form the vertices of the polyhedron. The polygons are the faces and their sides the edges of a polyhedron. A polyhedron is regular if its faces are identical (congruent) regular polygons and equal, and ali of its vertices are equivalent, i.e., ali its vertices are surrounded alike.\n \n 2\n \n Such a triangular frame remains rigid-in contrast to polygons of more than three sides, any of which will readily collapse when assembled with hinged joints. Of the Platonic polyhedra only the tetrahedra, octahedra, and icosahedra are composed of triangles, and are, therefore, the only figures of the five that are stable by virtue of their geometry. Again, if we construct ali five figures with struts as edges joined at their vertices by hingeable connectors, we see that the cu be and dodecahedra collapse, while the other three figures remain rigid. This demonstration has far-reaching significance for the study of structure: triangulation imparts strength to structures even before the physics of materiais is taken into account-it provides a head start to, and a guarantee of, structural rigidity. Although Plato's insights anticipated the concept of modular structures bui lt up from elementary constituent parts, his choices in the pairing of polyhedra with the four basic elements suggests that he may not h ave been aware of the physical implications of triangulation. lt is curious that he would have the unstable cube representing the earth, and the stable octahedron representing air. In any case, the inherent stability of triangulated polyhedra was a principie that hedid not elucidate. · Plato's triang les represent an attempt to establish a fundamental morphological system which could account for the variety of forms in nature. lt was, albeit primitive, a minimum inventory I maximum diversity system, perhaps the first vision of a geometrically based intrinsic force system. 1.1 The regular polyhedra of Plato (the \"Piatonic solids\"): tetrahedron (a), octahedron (b), hexahedron (c), icosahedron (d), ançJ dodecahedron (e).\n \n b\n \n c\n \n d\n \n e\n \n Triangulation and Closest Packing\n \n The repeated or iterated pattern of triangles is a pervasive geometrical arrangement in the physical world. lt is related to c/osest packing and can range in scale from structures easily seen with the unaided eye, e.g., the bee's honeycomb, to those requiring powerful magnification, e.g., the association of cells in tissues or closest packed atoms in certain crystals. lf circles are tightly packed, as densely as possible, and their centers joined, triangles are formed. When the centers of packed hexagons are joi ned, an array of triangles also results [i .2].\n \n C!osest Packing of Circ!es\n \n C!osest Packing of Hexagons\n \n 1.3 Figures formed by closest packed equal spheres.\n \n ~t::\n \n b. Regular Hexagon\n \n lf six equal spheres are tightly packed, an octahedron is formed [i.3d]. lf eight spheres are positioned so as to form the corners of a cube, an unstable condition is created. That isto say, when the sphere centers are joined in this configuration squares are formed, which have no geometrical stability. lt takes a minimum of i 4 c losest packed spheres to form a stable cube [i .3e]. Connecting ali centers here, of course, makes evident the diagonal bracing across the cube's six faces.\n \n &amp;lJ c. Tetrahedron\n \n ®\n \n e. Cube\n \n Considera stacking of cylinders of equal diameter. As cylinders are stacked upon each other, their natural tendency isto arrange themselves in a triangular order. The end view of such an arrangement looks like the packing of equal circles. This is simply the arrangement which requires the least effort to maintain-it is a minimum-energy configuration. In any case where we analyze the particular physical forces-of surface tension, gravitation, or whatever-that lead to a stable state of some physical system, we find triangulated solutions (i.e., triangulated arrangements) to be associated with the minimum-energy state, or, what is often the same thing, the minimum-resource state.\n \n d. Octahedron\n \n J\n \n *See Loeb ( 1966b) for another look at the same question.\n \n In a three-dimensional array of closest packed (as densely as possible) equal spheres, each sphere is exactly surrounded by twelve others. The centers of the outer spheres are the i 2 vertices of a polyhedron known as the cuboctahedron [i .3a]. In the plane, six spheres always surround a seventh, forming a regular hexagon [i .3b]. lf three spheres are packed together in a plane as tightly as possible and their centers joined, an equi lateral triang Ie is formed. lf a fourth sphere is placed upon the group of three spheres, the four vertices of the regular tetrahedron are established [i .3c].\n \n 1.2 Triangulation of two-dimensional closest packed arrays.\n \n a Cuboctahedron\n \n When packing many circles together, it is most economical (more circles can be placed in a given area) to impose \"triangular\" packing. In the limit of very many circles, ali of a common size, approximately 7% more circles may be placed in a g iven are a of plane su rface if the i r centers can be connected to form equilateral triang les rather than squares [i .4]*\n \n 3\n \n Triangulation and Closest Packing\n \n 1.4 Comparison of square and triangular packings of equal c i reles in a given area.\n \n Partitioning and Tessellation. Networks and Dual Networks\n \n lt is well known that, of ali plane figures, the circle encloses the greatest area of surface for a given circumference, oralternatively, encloses a given area with the smallest circumference. Likewise, of any three-dimensional shape the sphere matches the greatest volume to the least surface area. Do the circle and the sphere remain the most economical possibilities when we are concerned with the manycelled partitioning of space? Considerthe partitioning formed by closest packed circles: although each circle by itself is very economical (i.e., it encloses rnaximum area for its given perimeter) srnall concave tri ang les are formed between circles. Now, concave triangles match the least area with the greatest circumference. Consequently we can say that, considering the entire plane, circle packing is not the most economical system. However, let us allow the circles to change their shape sue h that they fi li up the concave triang les, forming hexagons [1.5]. This becomes the most economical rnethod for partitioning a surface into equal units of area. lt is worth reiterating what is here meant by \"economical partitioning.\" That partitioning is economical which divides up a space into cells of maximum size for a given amount of wall material. In the example just discussed, we have seen how simple geometrical reasoning has led us to a hexagonal tessellation of the plane in which there is no \"dead\" space between cells; ali is either enclosed, usable space or wall. Furthermore, though the foregoing demonstration is not to be considered a rigorous proof, it suggests that our hexagonal cells match minimum structure (the overall length of the walls) to maximum usable area.\n \n In addition to being the most economical partitioning of the plane, hexagonal tessellation is also the simplest. That is, a given plane surface cannot be continuously divided without at least three edges meeting at each point. lf only two edges meet ata point the plane cannot be continuously divided. lt has been shown (Courant and Robbins, pp. 354-361) that if three points are to be interconnected by means of a network whose total length is to be a minimum, they must be joined by three line segments meeting at an intermediate point at 120° angles, with the condition that in the triangle defined by the three points there are no ang les greater than 120 degrees. Furthermore, connecting an arbitrary number of random points in the plane in such a way as to minimize the total distance between the points results in a series of line segments meeting in threes at 120° angles within the area defined by the point array [1.6]. The packing of hexagons reveals the fundamental relationship of the triangular order of close packed circles with the requirements of minimal partitioning. Since the general sense of the closest packing of circles is that of associated finite units, i.e., a packing of circular disks or cylinders, and since it is not comprised of straight line-segments joined at vertices, it is usually not considered a network. On the other hand, a packing of hexagons may readily be considered a network since a network can be considered to be a connected set of straight line segments (edges) joined to each other at their ends to form vertices, such that two-dimensional or three-dimensional space is subdivided or partitioned. From any network we can construct a reciproca! or dual network. A dual network may be constructed on a surface by joining the center of each polygonal cell in a given network with the centers of ali of its neighboring cells through their common edges. In the case of the hexagon system, the reciproca! network is an array of triangles [1.2]. When the hexagons are ali exactly regular, the triangular network will be composed entirely of regular triang les meeting in groups of six at each vertex. Such a network which is equilateral, equiangular, and in which ali vertices are equal, may be considered a regular network.\n \n 1.5 Changing closest packed circles into closest packed hexagons.\n \n 4\n \n Geometry as Structure\n \n Sphere packings represent the threedimensional generalization of circle packings in the plane. The triangular order of sphere packings gives ri se to a threedimensional network of equi lateral triangles forming the faces of tetrahedra and octahedra in a space filling array.* ls there a three-dimensional analog to the hexagon packing? ls there a polyhedron which will uniformly partition threedimensional space with less total surface area per unit of enclosed volume than any other shape? The answer is affirmative but is more subtle than that for the twodimensional case. *\"Space filling\" means the combining of like or complementary bodies in a three-dimensional packing continuously repeated, in sue h a way that there is no unoccupied space. 1.6 A \"minimum-length\" connection of random points in a plane.\n \n Filling the Voids: The Kelvin Figure\n \n Justas the closest packed circles left concave spaces between them, so does an array of closest packed spheres. As we might suspect, these concave shapes have high surface area per unit volume and consequently depreciate the minimalsurface advantage of the spheres. If the spheres are swol.len to fi li in these concave voids, a polyhedron results with 12 identical rhombic faces. lt is known as the rhombic dodecahedron [1.7a].\n \n 1. 7 Rhombic dodecahedron (a), truncated octahedron (b), and lhe Kelvin minimal tetrakaidecahedron (c).\n \n Since in an array of closest packed spheres, each sphere is alike surrounded by 12 others, it is not so surprising that this polyhedron would have exactly 12 faces. A dual network for space filling polyhedra may be found by constructing edges which join the centers of every polyhedron in the space filling array with the centers of ali its neighboring polyhedra which share common faces. Doing this we would find that the network which is dual to the space filling array of rhombic dodecahedra is the space filling array of tetrahedra and octahedra in which 12 edges meet at the vertices that fali at the centers of the original rhombic dodecahedra.\n \n a\n \n b\n \n Can we say that the rhombic dodecahedron is the shape with the least surface area per unit of volume that will uniformly partition space? ls it the three-dimensional generalization of the hexagon? The answer is no, except in some special circumstances. We must look further. Lord Kelvin (1887) showed that there is one shape made up of plane surfaces that will uniformly partition space with less surface area than the rhombic dodecahedron. This shape is called thetruncated octahedron, a polyhedron bounded by six square faces and eight regular hexagonal faces, a total of 14 fac'es. The standard plane faced version of this shape [1.7b] has approximately 1% less surface area for a given volume than the rhombic dodecahedron. Kelvin also proposed a \"minimal tetrakaidecahedron\"* [1.7c], in which a very slight saddle curvature is given to the hexagon faces of the truncated ootahedron; the result is approximately O. 103% less surface for a given volume than for the truncated octahedron (Lifshitz).\n \n c\n \n *Tetrakaidecahedron means fourteen-hedra: a polyhedron with 14 faces. Tetra = four and deca = ten. Tetrakaideca =letra plus (kai) deca = fourteen.\n \n 5\n \n Filling the Voids: The Kelvin Figure\n \n The closest packing of truncated octahedra can be considered to be a denser packing than that of the rhombic dodecahedron because in a space filling array each truncated octahedron is surrounded by 14 others corresponding to its 14 faces, while the rhombic dodecahedron is surrounded by only 12 like cells. Space filling truncated octahedra give rise to a dual network consisting of congruent isosceles-triang le-faced tetrahedra known as tetragonal disphenoids (Coxeter 1963). This network consists of edges of two different lengths, 14 meeting at each vertex (in the ratio of 1:3). Like the packing of tetrahedra and octahedra, this system constitutes a very efficient, fully triangulated structural framework. Space filling truncated octahedra is thus evidently a minimum-energy system. As such, it must be considered to be the generalization to three dimensions of the hexagon. Nevertheless, we find that the rhombic dodecahedron, as well as the truncated octahedron, appears as the basis of the solution to certain minimal problems in nature; and thus we are hard put to identify one or the other as the most general solution. The rhombic dodecahedron and the truncated octahedron exhibit similar geometric characteristics when they are viewed in cellular arrays. VVith both systems, there are always three shared faces (partitions) meeting on an edge. For the rhombic dodecahedron these shared faces meet at ang les of 120°, whi Ie for the truncated octahedron they meet at 125°16', 109°28', and 125°16'. In space filling array, the rhombic dodecahedron has two classes of vertices: four edges meeting at a vertex at 109°28' ang les and eight edges meeting ata vertex at ang les of 70°32', in the ratio of two 4-connected vertices for every 8-connected vertex.* The space filling truncated octahedron has only one type of vertex, which is 4-connected, with alternating angles of 90° and 120°. Looking at the individual polyhedra, we find that the rhombic dodecahedron has eight 3-connected vertices (that isto say, eight with three edges surrounding each vertex) and six 4-connected vertices, a total of 14, and the truncated octahedron has 24 3-connected vertices. *In this book, an \"n-connected vertex\" will be taken to be one at which n edges meet.\n \n Many-Celled Soap Bubble Arrays Where equal tensions exist in ali the faces of a cellular array, the array equilibrates into an arrangement in which ali shared faces meet at ang les of 120° and ali vertices are joined alike by four edges meeting at angles of 109°28'. This is exhibited in the random array of soap bubbles shown in [1.8].* In soap-film behavior, nature has provided us with a most elegant demonstration of minimal principies. When studying a soap-film array, such as that shown in [1.8], we quickly note that neither pure rhombic dodecahedra nor pure truncated octahedra appear. The Kelvin minimal tetrakaidecahedron has been proposed as the archetypal soap-bubble cell. With the minimal tetrakaidecahedron Kelvin enlarged the class of truncated octahedra to include those whose faces are saddleshaped hexagons bounded by plane ares. The square faces of the truncated octahedra remain plane, but are necessarily also bounded by the same are edges. This transforms the truncated octahedron to the minimal tetrakaidecahedron and satisfies the requirement in space filling array that three interfaces meet on a ccmmon edge at 120° ang les and that four face edges meet at a common point at 109°28' ángles. The minimal tetrakaidecahedron, like the truncated octahedron, has a fully triangulated dual network (tetragonal disphenoidal network).\n \n *Wilh soap bubble arrays of two differenl volumes, Malzke foúnd an average of 13.53 faces and agai n observed lhal lhe majorily of face-s were penlagons. Some rare examples of lhe Kelvin figure were reported for leaf lissues by Macior and Malzke.\n \n Although the Kelvin tetrakaidecahedron is the mathematically ideal minimal-energy equivolume cell shape, it rarely occurs in nature, for the simple reason that nature rarely partitions equally. The few known cases where it has been observed shows it in fairly distorted form. Matzke (1946) conducted experiments to create equivolume soap bubble arrays. He was unable to actually form the Kelvin minimal tetrakaidecahedron, but in a sample of 600 bubbles was able to show that, as an average, the polyhedra had 13.70 faces, very close to the 14. He also observed that a majority of the faces that appeared were pentagons. lt is interesting to note that the tetrakaidecahedron has an average of 5.14 edges per face. Figure [1.9] shows camera Iuci da drawings made from bubble froths in Matzke's experiments.

The Law of Closest Packing and Triangulation. For any soap bubble array, either random or uniform, at least we can say that the cells will be organized according to a triangular order. More specifically, in a two-dimensional froth, cells meet in threes around each vertex and consequently always define triangles, and in a threedimensional soap froth, the cells meet in fours around each vertex and always define tetrahedra. In soap froth there is never any exception to this rule. A single soap bubble floating freely in space is spherical. This is the state of minimum potential energy. When in association with other cells, it becomes more economical for the sphere to change into a polyhedron. Let us now, following Thompson, consider the conjoining of bubbles that rest upon a plane surface. A single bubble is a simpie hemisphere [UOa]. When two bubbles of equal volume are combined they join forming a vertical planar interface between them [ 1.1 Ob ]. When viewed from above, the spherical surfaces and the interface form two vertices of three edges each where they contact the horizontal plane upon which they rest. Each of the two vertices is surrounded alike by one straight edge and two are edges. The surface areas of the two hemispheres are a minimum when the tangents of these are edges meet th~ straight edge such that they are ali surrounded by 120° angles. lf there is a difference in the size of two bubbles they will meet so that they still satisfy the 120° angle requirement; in such a case, therefore, ali three edges at each vertex will be curved.\n \n ''\n \n We may continue adding hemispherical bubbles to our structure, and not once will an intersect.ion appear in which there are other than three edges meeting ata point [ U Of-h]. lf the bubbles are ali of approximately equal volume ali the polygonal circuits that are formed will be very close in shape to hexagons, except those at the periphery of the array. lf there are great differences in the sizes of adjacent bubbles in a random array, shapes other than hexagons will appear: pentagons, heptagons, even octagons or more multisided circuits [1.11]. Nevertheless, there will still be no exception to the rule of three edges meeting ata point, and in sufficiently large arrays the shapes will tend to average out to ones of six sides. In ali cases, the dual network will be triangular, although not necessarily equilateral. In three-dimensional arrays of bubbles the rule appears to change to the extent that there are always four edges meeting at each vertex at ang les of 109°28'. In actuality, the view of three edges meeting ata point at 120° is simply aplan (cross sectional) view of the three partition faces meeting on a common edge at 120° angles.* *This is easily demonstrated with a wire frame tetrahedron dipped in soap. (See Thompson 11:497.)\n \n b.\n \n Q\n \n 8\n \n c.@\n \n d0 ffi e.\n \n f@\n \n g.w h@ 1.1 O Simple planar combinations of hemispherical soap bubbles viewed from above. The \"square\" array (e) is unstable. 1.11 Triangulation of a planar array of random bubbles viewed from above.\n \n lf three hemispherical bubbles are combined, it is found that they arrange themselves with three planar interfaces ali meeti ng at 120° ang les [ 1.1 Oc]. The three edges meeting at each point are preserved. When four hemispherical bubbles combine, they also only create intersections in which three edges meet ata point [ 1.1 Od]. lt is impossible to form a group of four hemispherical bubbles in such a way that they surround a common point in the manner shown in [ 1.1 Oe]. Sue h a \"square\" array is an unstable condition, for the surface areais not ata minimum in this arrangement. The intersection created by four cells on a surface [1.10d] is called the polar furrow (Thompson 11:4S7). This furrow, as we shall see, serves as a useful clue for the identification of closest packing in a variety of contexts.\n \n 7\n \n a.\n \n Simple Bubble Arrays\n \n A Law of Closest Packing and Triangulation can be proposed: when compactarrays of volumetric (morphological) units (bubbles, cells, atoms, etc.) are formed by any externai or internai attractive forces, they tend to have the greatest possible numbers of neighboring units while equalizing as nearly as possible the distances between their centers. The network which joins the centers of ali nearest neighbors is always triangulated (usually in multi pies of tetrahedra) and tends towards uniform edge lengths. Also, when such volumetric units consist (momentarily or permanently) of relatively fluid interfaces they tend to take the shape of polyhedra cells of minimum surface area relative to their volumes with faces meeti ng edges at ang les of 120° and edges meeting vertices at angles of 109°28'. These angles are imposed by the forces of surface tension and satisfy the conditions of minimum potential energy.* With its dual network of equilateral triangles, the rhombic-dodecahedral packing might be taken to be the minimum-energy system for a bubble array insofar as the distances between rhombic dodecahedron centers are ali exactly the same. This arrangement, equivalent to the twelve-around-one packing of closest packed spheres, might seem to be the most compact arrang~ment. But we have seen that the truncated octahedron packs with 14 neighbors, and, as such, is a denser or more compact arrangement than the sphere or rhombic-dodecahedral packing. *Loeb, inspired by Laves and Fuller, has proposed a similar idea for the structure of crystals: \"Crystal structures tend to assume canfiguratians in which a maximum number of identical atoms or ians are equidistant from each other; if more than a single type of atam or ian are present, then each atam or ion tends to be equidistant from as many as possible of each type of atam or ian. lt is a simple extension of the fact that a stable. system of three identical interacting particles will arrange itself in an equilateral triangle, that four such partieles will occupy the corners of a regular tetrahedron, etc.\" (Laeb 1967b).\n \n 8\n \n The dual network of the truncated octahedron consists of edges which differ in length by 15%. A homogeneous array of identical tetragonal disphenoids results. The tetrahedron is the simplest of ali possi ble polyhedra and is the strongest per unit of invested energy. The reciproca! net of the rhombic-dodecahedral array contains both tetrahedra and octahedra. This reflects the fact that both 4-connected and 8-connected vertices appear in the rhombic-dodecahedral array. An octahedron, although a highly efficient structure, may be considered to be somewhat less strong than a tetrahedron-even one that is slightly distorted, as in the case of the isosceles-faced tetragonal disphenoid. A simple explanation for the rare occurrence of Kelvin's ideal minimal tetrakaidecahedron might be that nature seeks a compromise solution which tends to have the higher density of packing of truncated-octahedra along with the uniform distances of the rhombic-dodecahedral packing. lt may be that if some means could be found to measure the distances between the centers of the adjacent equivolume bubbles of Matzke's study, it would be found that these distances differed by less than 15%, and tended to approach the ideal of a uniform distance between cells. The average of 13.70 faces that Matzke observed may constitute a compromise between maximum density and minimum difference in center-to-center distances. This may provide even less total surface area per unit of volume than does the Kelvin figure. Although it would be difficult to verify, such a hypothesis suggests that an efficient physical construct does not always conform to an ideal mathematical solution. In the study of three-dimensional physical structure, we see that nature frequently utilizes apparent distortions of ideal mathematical forms because the distortions are more economical from an energy standpoint.\n \n Geometry as Structure\n \n Closest Packed Unequal Spheres. Coordination Polyhedra and Polyhedral Domains Frank and Kasper (1958, 1959) have described the structures of complex metal alloys in terms of the packi ng of spheres in which the allowance of small variations of sphere diameters permits denser packings than the characteristic twelvearound-one packing of equal spheres. Such packings are not homogeneous but combine, for different alloys, in various combinations of 12, 14, 15, and 16 spheres packed around any given sphere. The networks that define the centers of these sphere packing structures consist exclusive/y of space filling arrangements of tetrahedra. They are not ali regular but differences in edge lengths are minimized as in the case of the more uniform tetragonal-disphenoidal packing. The number of spheres surrounding any given sphere is called the coordination (or coordination number) Z. lf in these sphere packings with coordinations of 12, 14, 15, or 16, the spheres are \"expanded\" to fill a[l the unoccupied space, polyhedra result with 12, 14, 15, and 16 faces, respectively. Such polyhedra are known as coordination polyhedra. Any given sphere packing will have a corresponding set of space filling coordination polyhedra. The dual network to any such space filling system will correspond exactly to the network derived from connecting the centers of spheres in the closest packed array represented by the space filling array of coordination polyhedra. Since both of these networks are equivalent, the number of edges meeting at each vertex will exactly correspond to the coordination number of the sphere or polyhedron representing said vertex. Therefore the number of edges meeting ata given vertex is also known as the vertex coordination Z.\n \n Since the coordination polyhedron represents the environment, or discrete region of space, associated with a given sphere in a closest packed array, or associated with a given vertex of a connected network, such a polyhedron may also be called the domain (or polyhedral domain) of the sphere, or likewise the domain (or polyhedral domain) of the vertex. In the case of the domain of the vertex, the polyhedral domain will have the same number of faces as there are edges joining the vertex found at its center. The network formed by the space fi li i ng array of such polyhedral domains is exactly reciproca! to the network connecting the vertices which it represents. For example, the rhombic dodecahedron is both the coordination polyhedron and the poly- · hedral domain for closest packed equal spheres, and for the network generated by the space filling of tetrahedra and octahedra. The network generated by the space filling array of rhombic dodecahedra is reciproca! to that of the space fillingof tetrahedra and octahedra. Since there are 12 spheres around every sphere in the closest packed array, 12 faces on the rhombic dodecahedron, and 12 edges meeting at each vertex in the network of space filling tetrahedra and octahedra, the coordination number for the sphere, the domain, and network is 12. The reader is reminded that \"connected\" also refers to the number of edges meeting at a vertex.\n \n The coordination polyhedra corresponding to the sphere packings of Z = 12, 14, 15, and 16 are bounded by pentagons and hexagons and their vertices are ali 3-connected. They are respectively a dodecahedron boúnded by 12 pentagons, a tetrakaidecahedron bounded by two hexagons and 12 pentagons, a pentakaidecahedron bounded by three hexagons and 12 pentagons, and an hexakaidecahedron bounded by four hexagons and 12 pentagons [ 1.12]. Although Frank and Kasper do not discuss these polyhedra intheir articles, they are described in another context by K. W. Allen. We will also take them up in some detai I Iater in this book. Owing to the predominance of pentagons, the 4-connected networks formed by various packing combinations of these four polyhedra have a remarkable resemblance to soap-bubble arrays, which, as we have already noted, also exhibit an overwhelming number of pentagons. lf slight warpage of the faces is permitted, ali four of the polyhedra just described can be constructed so that in any space filling array ali vertices are not only 4-connected but are also equally surrounded by 109°28' ang les. Also, the partitioning faces will then meet on common edges in groups ofthree at 120° angles. In the 28 different actual and hypothetical structures classified by Frank and Kasper, it is shown that the average coordination is 13.35, remarkably close to the 13.53 average number of faces of Matzke's unequal soap bubbles, and to his 13.70 average number of faces for equivolume bubbles. These complex alloy structures studied by Frank and Kasper seem to follow the law ofclosest packing and triangulation. * *Bernal (1959) has proposed a random triangulated configuration for the molecular structure of liquids which, although not necessarily describable as adense arrangement of spheres, consists of space filling tetrahedra in which the distance between neighboring atoms tends toward a minimum. Bernal's approach shows definite similarities to those others discussed here.\n \n 1.12 Coordination polyhedra corresponding to sphere packings of Z = 12, dodecahedron (a); 14, tetrakaidecahedron (b); 15, pentakaidecahedron (c); and 16, hexakaidecahedron (d).\n \n 9\n \n The Soap-Bubble Array as Archetype\n \n The Soap-Bubble Array as Archetype A remarkable series of papers by Lewis, Marvin, and Matzke has discussed soap bubbles, compression of lead shot, the cells of various plants, and human fat cells. A generally consistent behavior is exhibited in these diverse realms. The forms of the systems are manifestations of the least-energy principie. Ali of the systems tend to conform to the law of closest packing and triangulation, although there are many other forces at work, particularly in biological systems where growth rates an,d sequences contrai rnorphological dévelopment. Smith compared soap-filmfroth behavior to the microstructure of metais and their grain shapes. (Smith 1948, 1952, 1953, W. M. Williams and Smith 1952). In \"The Shape of Things\" Smith says, \"lt seems at first astonishing that the cells of things as different as a metal and a soap froth can be almost indistinguishable in shape, but this is easily understood when it is realized that the interfaces between crystals are themselves essentially liquid like. The atoms in the boundary between two crystal grains are subjected to the opposing fields of both lattices. Since both cannot be satisfied simultaneously, a layer of atoms (probably not more than three or four atam diameters thick) is unable to crystallize. This fluid interface, which must be continuous, has associated with it a high surface tension, which makes it tend to shrink in exactly the same way as a soap film. Only a crystal growing freely without contact with others can have the highly symmetrical polyhedral shape that is usually thought to typify a crystal.\" Soap bubble packing, then, can be taken as the mode! or type of ali systemsbiological, physical, chemical-in which there is an economical association of cellular modules. And, at this point we may conclude that triangulation and closest packing are truly equivalent and that closest packing is at the heart of those principies that operate regardless of scale.\n \n Hexagons, Hierarchies, and Scale lndependence\n \n 2 Closest Packing\n \n Perhaps the most familiar example of closest packing, and certainly the most sublime, is the honeycomb of the bee [2.1]. This system, in plan one of regular hexagons, contains the greatest amount of honey with the least amount of beeswax (Toth 1964a), and is the structure which requires the least energy for the bees to construct.\n \n in Nature\n \n 2.1 Bees' honeycomb.\n \n 2.2 Honeycomb cell structure.\n \n The bee's cell appears to be a simple hexagonal prism; however, because the honeycomb consists of two sets of contiguous cells, positioned back to back, it takes on a more complicated form. The back-to-back cells are staggered in such a way that the centers of the set of cells on one side are positioned exactly over half of the three-rayed intersections of cell walls of the set of cells on the other side. This can be seen by looking at [2.2] with care. This arrangement corresponds to a packing of two layers of rhombic dodecahedra (or of two layers of closest packed spheres). The bees' cell is simply a rhombic dodecahedron with one end opened up to form a flat hexagon, and as such it is a 10-faced polyhedron bounded by three rhomboidal faces from the rhombic dodecahedron which form the \"bottom\" of the cell, six trapezoidal faces which form the six sides of the cell, and one hexagonal face which is the cell opening [2.3]. * The order manifest in the structure of bees' or wasps' nests appears, though perhaps in lesser degree, throughout biological morphology, and we find it to be common in crystal structure. The very ubiquitousness of such energy-efficient solutions is important, because the development of a general morphological system rests on the possibi'lity of discovering fundamental relationships among the broadest range of possible structures. As we examine various natural structures and the reasons for them, we wi li be constantly reminded that closest packing is simply a reflection of nature's tendency to coordinate extrinsic and intrinsic forces in the most energy-economic way. *For a detailed discussion of the structure and formation of the honeycomb, see Thompson li: 525. 2.3 Single honeycomb cell, showing rhombic dodecahedron within.\n \n 10\n \n We perceive the possibility of ~ierarchic structure when we realize that closest packing is independent of absolute specific size. A large number of naturally occurring substances and systemsorganic, inorganic, animate, or inanimate-will prove to be closest packed /fÍen viewed at the appropriate levei of , magnification. But, what is more important, within the same substance similar packings or structures (hierarchies) wi li appear at grossly different scales. In many instances, a closest packed microstructure will determine the options that a closest packed macrostructure may take. We can think again of intrinsic and extrinsic forces, in which one force may become the other as we pass through different hierarchies of scale. Natural structures are (for the most part) three-dimensional, while photographs and compilations of them, as in this book, are usually 1two-dimensional representations, such as in the cross sectional views of a cellular structure. These \"two-dimensional samples\" of three-dimensional structures tend to be dominated by three-rayed vertices, which, as was pointed out in Chapter 1, are often cróss-sectional representations of three partition faces meeting on a common edge at equal angles of 120°. The reader is also reminded that in three dimensions the condition of three faces meeting on a common edge at 120° is a consequence of four edges meeting at a common vertex at 109°28'.\n \n 11\n \n Weibel describes a schematic model of the arrangement of alveo! i around the alveolar duct of the human lung [2.4]. This structure calls to mind a hexagonal honeycomb wrapped around a cylindrical surface with hexagonal openings facing inward. This alveolar system exhibits a hierarchical structure; the cell walls of the alveo! i are composed of very fine capillary networks which are also hexagonally structured. A schematic sketch of this capillary network [2.5] structure shows the juncture of three cell walls. The continuity of the three-rayed hexagonal network of the capillary structure is maintained at this intersection of three cell-wall surfaces. 2.4 Alveo Ii in the human lung (Weibel). 2.5 Three-rayed, hexagonal capillary network of alveoli (Weibel).\n \n Hexagons, Hierarchies\n \n Differential Growth, Edge Effects, and Other lnteractions\n \n The cracking and drying of mud also proceeds in a \"hexagonal\" manner, complete with polar furrows [2. 7].\n \n Although the basis of various twodimensional networks is the hexagonal cell, in biological systems particularly, we must take into account growth sequences, sequential solidification of various parts, and \"edge effects\"; ali these greatly influence final form. The dragonfly's wing is a very good illustration of this [2.6]. \"The wing is traversed by a few strong \"veins\" or ribs, more or less parai lei to one another, between which finer veins make a meshwork of \"cells\", these lesser veins being ali much of a muchness and exerting tensions insignificant compared with those of the greater veins. Where (a) two ribs run so near together that only one row of cells lies between, these cells are quadrangular in form, their thin partitions meeting the ribs at right angles on either side. Where (b) two rows of cells are intercalated between a pair of ribs, one row fits into the other by ang les of '120°, the result of co-equal tensions; but both meet the ribs at right angles, as in the former case. Where (c) the cell rows are numerous, ali their angles in common tend to be co-equal angles of '120°, and the cells resolve, consequently, into a hexagonal network.\" (Thompson 11:476-477) 2.6 Dragonfly wing.\n \n On cracked surfaces, such as on ceramic glaze, mud, etc., where the cracks do not form simultaneously, 3-connected vertices still appear; however, some areas tend to meet in a 90° configuration (later cracks being perpendicular to earlier ones), rather than in the '120° configuration growing out of situations where tensions or forces are the same in ali directions (isotropic force or growth). Given a condition of surface isotropy, geometrical considerations alone limit the possibilities, and consequently tend to produce the simplest of ali nets, the three-rayed hexagonal pattern. Many writers have remarked on this. Smith ('1954) states that \"if this limitation is maintained-that three edges must always meet ata point while varying polygon types are permittedthen in any sufficiently large net the average polygon will be a hexagon.\"* *Smith goes on to show that if Vis the number of vertices, P the number of polygons, and E the number of edges in any arbitr.ary finite sample of an infinite plane net, then V + P = E + 1. lf n is the number of sides of the average polygon in an infinite plane random net, then V/P = (n - 2)/2. Readers curious as to how an infinite net can have a finite number of elements may examine the strategem employed by Coxeter (1963, p. 58).\n \n 2. 7 Cracked mud.\n \n 12\n \n Closest Packing in Nature\n \n There are numerous structures in which a final stage obscures the overall determinant of a particular form. The pinecone is one such case. Seen before it has \"opened\" up into an array of radiating branches, it clearly exhibits the closest packing of morphological units [2.8]. 2.8 Pinecone\n \n Although the closest packed organization of the watermelon can be readi ly seen with the naked eye, it is not likely that we would associate it with our hexagonal structures if we were not acquainted with the concept of the polar furrow [2.9]. 2.9 Watermelon\n \n That nature's method of closest packing is independent of scale may be inferred from the preceding illustrations. Mudcrack cells [2. 7] are of the arder of meters to decimeters wide; the watermelon [2.9] and pinecones [2.8] span decimeters to centimeters; the dragonfly-wing and honeycomb cells bring us down to millimeters; whi Ie the alveo/ i and alveolar networks [2.4, 2.5] occupy microns only. Thus we have already spanned a range of scale of six orders of magnitude. The same structure appears in the region of fractions of a micron, as in [2. i O] which shows an electron micrograph of a cross section through the exocrine cells of the pancreas of a mouse. These cells are typical of mammalian ultrastructure. The light grey areas in the photograph are the nuclei of the cells, and we can see cell boundaries that meet in three-rayed intersections. When such cells are formed they tend to compress against each other as more cells divide and crowd (closest pack) i nto the avai lable space.\n \n A Catalog of Natural Forms\n \n Metais and Crystals\n \n The foregoing examples of hexagons in plane forms, hierarchies, and scale independence do not of course prove that nature must act in these ways. lndeed, as in empírica/ science generally, we can never prove that observed behavior is universal, for we can only infer from particular cases; and, if nature has not quite an infinite stock of possibilities, it at least always has one more than the total number we have investigated. Nonetheless, equipped only with a reasonable faith in nature's overall consistency, we can accept induction from particular cases as a reliable guide toward the truth. In this spirit I offer the following catalog of natural forms. lts essence is visual, and its excitement, I think, lies in the exhibited variations on the hexagonal theme. Perhaps the theme will inspire some readers to investigate areas not cataloged here, while the variations will inspire others to seek (or design) similarly satisfying forms.\n \n [2. i i] Heated a/um inum sheet. The surface of a heated aluminum sheet shows, at the early stages of melting, a network not unlike those exhibited by a twodimensional array of soap bubbles. lt not only consistently follows the rui e of three edges meeti ng ata point, but there is a strong tendency for each point to be surrounded by i 20° ang les.\n \n 2.1 O Ultrastructure of exocrine cells of mo use pancreas (3, 700X, Rhodin).\n \n i3\n \n A Catalog of Natural Forms\n \n 2.11 Surface of a heated aluminum sheet (2.5X, Smith).\n \n [2.12] A/uminum-tin alloy. A dark polyhedral network is formed by the tin surrounding the light cells (crystals) of aluminum. This photograph is virtually indistinguishable from a soap bubble froth seen with the unaided eye. This is even true to the extent that the vertices are typically surrounded by four edges (four cells) meeting at approximately 109°. \"The individual grains in a piece of metal or the bubbles in a soap froth must satisfy two conditions-they must be in juxtaposition soas to fi li space and their interfaces must conform to the laws of surface tension\" (W. M. Williams and Smith).\n \n [2.13] Etched aluminum surface.

The grain boundaries of a section through niobium metal, revealed through etching, show a similar pattern to that of the heated aluminum sheet. In both these cases, there appears to be a lack of uniformity, but careful study reveals very few, if any, exceptions to the three-rayed vertex surrounded by ang les of 120°. The etched niobium metal sample shows- a cross section through space filling polyhedra. Each metal grain is a polyhedral crystal which meshes with its neighbors in a closest packed array. The interface between adjacent crystals where regions of different crystallographic orientation meet is called a dislocation in the crystal lattice. The intrinsic forces within the crystal grain confront the extrinsic forces which arise from the environment of neighboring crystals.\n \n Closest Packing in Nature\n \n [2. 15] Fíeld íon mícroscope photograph of platínum. A dramatic verification of the concept of closest packing as a basic structural principie of nature is achieved with the use of the field ion microscope developed by Müller (1957, 1960). In this photo of platinum, closest packed arrays of individual atoms can be seen.\n \n 2.15 Field ion microscope image of platinum (600,000X, Müller).\n \n 2.16 Sphere packing models of metal structure: cork ball model, same model with certain balls coded with fluorescent paint, and field ion micrograph of tungsten (600,000X, Müller).\n \n [2. 16] Sphere packíng mode/s of metal structure. The field ion micrograph reveals various symmetrical collections of atoms which follow patterns determined by the possible combinations of planar regions of three-dimensional closest packed atoms. With an array of equal cork balls closest packed with their centers positioned on the vertices of a packing of tetragonal disphenoids, Müller has demonstrated the correspondence of sphere packing models to the actual crystal structure. The sequence reproduced here shows that the pattern exhibited by tungsten is the result of the geometry of the atomic packing.\n \n [2. 17] A crystal of retículated cerussite. This mineral forms an impressively uniform network structure which appears to be dominated by 60° angles. lt is what one might imagine a snow crystal would be like if it happened to take a threedimensional form rather than its familiar flat hexagonal shape. The externai forms of many crystals are well-known polyhedra, such as cubes, octahedra, and rhombic dodecahedra. The various possible options are determined by the internai structure of the atomic arrays. Likewise are the patterns revealed in the field ion micrographs determined by the internai structure of each crystal.\n \n 2.17 A crystal of reticulated cerussite (Smithsonian lnstitution).\n \n Plant Forms\n \n [2.18] Leaf structure.

A cross section of a reed shows a fairly uniform array of cells in conjunction with a finer froth where transitions are made to differing regions within the structure (epithelial and epidermal cells).\n \n 2.18 A typical leaf structure.\n \n [2.19] Poppy seeds. The poppy seed exhi bits a characteristic dimpled surface which consists of raised edges forming a three-rayed network. Such a pattern is formed by.the collapse of a smooth outer shell upon an inner shell dueto a loss of moisture. When the outer shell contracts, its surface area remains substantially unchanged and consequently ridges are formed to take up the excess surface. When it is realized that surface tension plays a role in shrinkage, it is clear that the forces which ac.t upon the poppy seed are not altogether different from those which act in the determination of soapfilm formations (Thompson 11:564).\n \n 2.20 Cross section of a reed (25X, Jírovec).\n \n [2.22] Phi!odendron. In enlarged view, the upper surface of the leaf of the philodendron appears to consist of highly irregular cell shapes. lt is an example of how far away a structure may get from the appearance of the hexagon cell, yet still satisfy its basic characteristics. This structure is most rema:rkable, indeed; the wiggly lines forming the cell boundafies still manage to meet in three-rayed 120° vertices. Here the average \"polygon\" still appears to be six-sided. Although the distribution of vertices appears to be quite random, the structure is still highly ordered. The dual network of such an arrangement is still fully triangulated; but because of the extremely asymmetric shapes of the cells, the dual network would require curvature of some of its edges. lt is difficult to say precisely what forces cause this leaf surface to be structured in this manner, but it is clear that the structure is a variant of close packing.\n \n [2.21] Cork cel/s. Microscopic cellular structure was first observed by Hooke in the seventeenth century. In his early studies with the microscope he found cork to consist of densely packed chambers somewhat resembling the bees' honeycomb. This was the beginning of the study of cells and cell shape. A modern microscopic view of cork shows the ubiquitous hexagonal cellular structure. 2.22 Upper surface of philodendron leaf (50X, Jírovec).\n \n 2.19 Poppy seeds (5X, Jírovec).\n \n [2.23] Mushroom.

The structure of the aquatic herb \"mare's tail\" is still another demonstration of hierarchical closest packing of cells. Not only is there a progressive concentric decrease, then increase, in relative cell size, but a peripheral structure appears as a gross framework of modulated cells in which not only the cells, but the framework of which they are the elements, meet at three-rayed intersections. Many such plants consist, not of spherical cells, but of columnar forms that are hexagonal in section yet are still three-dimensional polyhedral cells whose edges still tend to meet four around each vertex in a space-filling array. 2.24 Structure of an aquatic herb (\"mare's tail,\" 70X, Jírovec).\n \n [2.26] The rush Juncus; formation of stel/ate cells. A curious case that illustrates the duality of triangular networks and closest packed polyhedral cells can be seen in a microphotograph of a cross section of the cel/s in the pith of the rush Juncus. As we have seen, spherical cel/s that are forced to grow against each other fi// ali unoccupied space to create polyhedra. The triangulated ce/1 structure of Juncus indicates that some other process has taken place. Thompson has suggested a formative process for Juncus in which cel/s, rather than filling ali the unoccupied space, tend to col/apse except where the original contact was made. (Thompson 11:547) This has the effect of creating ai r voids which surround \"stel/ate\" cel/s in the pith. When these stellate cells are hooked together they form the triangulated network. A diagram of this process is shown in the figure. The possibility that ali the cells of the pith would be of equal size is unlikely. Consequently the stel/ate cel/s may have varying numbers of rays; and, recalling the arguments of Lewis (1925), I believe these probably tend to average closer to 14 than 12 as suggested by Thompson.\n \n [2.27] Diatoms. Diatoms, tiny marine algae with silicon dioxide skeletons, frequently consist of concentric or radiating hexagonal patterns with a uniformity approaching that of the bees' honeycomb. The forces acting within and without are relatively symmetrical and the resulting forms, although infinitely varied, arealmost always quite symmetrical. Diatoms take many different kinds of shapes, including squares, triangles, and longitudinal forms. Though they do not ali show hexagonal structures in their silicon di oxide skeletons, the triangular form shown in [2.27b] is structured with nearly regular hexagons.\n \n 2.26 Pith cells of the rush, Juncus (200X, Jírovec) anda diagram showing formation of stellate cells upon the collapse of closest packed hexagons.\n \n [2.25] Redwo'od r~ot.

The Radiolaria, numbering at least 4,000 species, each with its own characteristic arrangement of spicules and pseudopodia, are ali often spherical in form; as \"variations on the sphere,\" they are of great interest in the present study. Many, although not ali, of the radiolarian skeletons have straightforward hexagonal structuring on their surfaces [2.32].

An amusing example of a naturally occurring three-rayed hexagonal network isto be found in the pattern of the giraffe skin. The extremely uniform reptile skin is a packing of circles in which small triangles appear at the interstices.\n \n Close inspection of the three-rayed networks of the Radiolaria (as well as of pollen grains) reveals that not ali of the polygons are six-sided. Some polygons have fewer than six sides and occasional polygons of more than six sides are evident. lt can be shown that it is impossible with a system of hexagons, regular or irregular, to create a c/osed space (e.g., to completely cover the surface of a sphere) in which ali intersections .of the surface net are three-connected. 2.32 Spherical radiolarian skeletons (a), froth of radiolarian vesicles (b), and triangulated radiolarian skeletons (c) (Haeckel).\n \n b\n \n 2.28 Pollen grain of Morning Glory (a, 700X), and thrift pollen (b, 400X) (copyright 1969, Patrick Echlin and Cambridge Scientific lnstruments). 2.30 Giraffe skin. 2.31 Reptile skin (Brodatz).\n \n 18\n \n Closest Packing in Nature\n \n a\n \n The radiolarian skeletons consist of connected arrays of tiny cubular struts forming diverse and complex structural shells. These siliceous skeletons are built up upon protoplasmic bodies usually consisting of collections of component vesicles which are physically equivalent to cells although they are not cells in lhe usual sense. The vesicles are, in essence, constituent modules for the larger cell. They frequently form a froth of closest packed units spherically distributed (often in concentric spheres) in a closed structure [2.32b]. The hexagonally structured skeletons are formed as the inorganic material is deposited at the intersectrons of close packed vesicles. lt is important to stress that lhe hexagonal skeletons are incomplete structures since their physica/ efficiency is achieved in cooperation with other components of the organism (the close packed vesicles). The mistake should not be made that these hexagonal radiolarian skeletons are of themselves good models for the design of physical structures. They are stable (triangulated) only by virtue of their association with the rest of the organism to which they belong. There are a few species of Radiolaria in which there are actually employed fully triangulated spherical skeletons [2.32c].\n \n I do not know to what processes of growth these triangulated radiolarian structures can be attributed. They are essentially duais of the hexagonal skeletons whose formation has been reasonably well explained.* We can be sure that the radiolarian skeletons are nature's most economical structural solution to some given set of conditions. The similarity of these structures to Fuller's geodesic domes cannot but strike one. According to Makowski (in Davies), the French structural i nnovator Le Ricolais had in 1940 proposed spherical-shell structures based upon the design of the triangulated networks of the Radiolaria. With this proposai, Le Ricolais anticipated Fuller's independent invention and reduction to practice of the geodesic dome which dates from approximately 1948 (Marks). *Thompson explains in great detail the process of formation of many of the radiolarian forms. However, nowhere does he discuss the triangulated spherical skeletons.\n \n c\n \n b\n \n 19\n \n A Catalog of Natural Forms\n \n [2.33] Vo/vox. A polyhedral structure is seen in Volvox, a freshwater colonial protozoan. Volvox is a spherically organized colony of several hundred to several thousand zooids which occupy the periphery of a gelatinous colonial envelope. The zooids are each enclosed in gelatinous sheaths which are closest packed, forming the familiar three-rayed network on the surface of a sphere. Each zooid is linked to its neighbors by protoplasmic strands which forma triangulated dual network to the three-connected network formed by the closest packed zooid cells. 2.33 Volvox (courtesy of American Museum of Natural History).\n \n [2.34, 2.35] lnsect eyes. The surface structure of the compound eye of the bumblebee has nearly regular hexagonal faceting upon a segment of a spherical surface. The scanning electron microscope reveals the closest packed character of the lens elements of the fly's compound eye. The retinal structure of the moth presents a curious example of a hierarchical morphology. In the cross-sectional structure, circular units are arranged in almost perfect equilateral-triangular order, and are surrounded by a \"froth\" of tiny hexagons. The cells of this froth fitas a substructure to the relatively gross hexagonal network of the circular units.\n \n [2.36] Perítrophíc membrane.

When parallel bundles offilaments or wires are \"tensed\" they are compressed against each other. Under such forces they assume closest packing.\n \n 2.37 lnsect flight muscle filaments (200,000X, Huxley).\n \n [2.38] Adenovírus. Here can be seen an electron-microscope photograph of adenovirus, and also a photograph of a sphere packing model of the same form which reveals more clearly a 20-sided icosahedral configuration. Because the icosahedron gives ri se to the most symmetrical distribution of points (or anything) on the sphere, it is reasonable that these spherical virus particles would have icosahedral symmetry.* One can assume that the virus takes this configuration in order to satisfy requirements of minimum energy and that because of the high symmetry, there must be relatively symmetrical intrinsic and extrinsic forces acting in the formation of the virus. *lt is impossible to create a convex polyhedron with more than 20 equilateral trian')les and consequently the icosahedron is the generating figure for the most symmetrical possible class of polyhedra. The subdivision of the sphere based upon the icosahedron gives ri se to the most uniform cases of triangulated spherical structures. lt has been this property of the icosahedron that Fui ler has so aptly taken advantage of in the design of his domes.

The virus structures show ordered patterns approaching the uniformity of crystals. I have shown diverse examples that, for a variety of causes, exemplify patterns characteristic of close packing behavior. We cannot say that ali of the patterns shown are fully explainable only in terms of closest packing, ora law of triangulation, or even in terms of the forces of surface tension. I have simply attempted to note the occurrence of closely related, if not analogous or equivalent, patterns that do occur in nature. The differences in scale, environment, and substance do not noticeably alter the principies that I have been describing. There can be little doubt that we are dealing with some very fundamental relationships which in any case satisfy minimal principies consistently employed by nature.\n \n 3\n \n Triangulation of Built Forms\n \n In Chapter 1 we saw that the triangle is the only polygon that is stable by virtue of its geometry and, passing to three dimensions, that only fully triangulated polyhedra are geometrically stable (p. 3). We now proceed to a fuller study of the CEJnsequences of the triangulation of real structures in three dimensions.\n \n Some Principies of Built Structure\n \n lt is clear, then, that a built cube, or any other nontriangulated structure, will require rigid (i.e., nonrotating) joints if it is to be itself rigid, while a triangulated construction can get along with hinged (i.e., rotating) joints without collapsing. Now the difference in the effect of rigid and hinged joints is this: the former can transmit (in fact they generate) bending forces* (couples or moments) as well as axial forces, while the latter can transmit only axial forces [3.1]. This is important when we pass over from abstract geometry into the physical world, because nearly ali materiais can resist far more stress when it is applied axially (tension or compression) than when it is applied transversely (bending).** The same strut is more effective when it is loaded as a column than when it is loaded as a beam [3.2]. *In materiais science applied forces are called stresses, and the subsequent responses of materiais are called strains. I will have no occasion to talk about strains directly in this book, and will use \"force\" and \"stress\" interchangeably. The reader may have already noted that, following the common parlance of designers, I sometimes use \"force\" in a wider sense than a physicist or engineer would, giving it the sense of \"influence\" merely, as in \"environmental forces.\" In ali cases, the meaning intended will be clear from the context.\n \n 3.1 Loading a square and a triangular frame. 3.2 Applying stresses axially (tension or compression) and transversely (bending).\n \n Co\\umn\n \n 22\n \n **In this chapter we will not consider torsion (twisting) or shear (the sliding of one portion of a material over adjacent parts), although the latter can be considered a byproduct of bending.\n \n By coupling the fortunate inadequacy ot hinged joints to the geometrical stabi lity, we can allow ou r built torms to take advantage ot their struts' high axial strength, and avoid having to rely on their poor resistance to bending.* However, because nontriangulated structures require coupleinducing joints, such built torms must perforce respond to moments; they must, and do, distort easily under load. *A not inconsequential advantage ot manycelled triángulated structures, arising trom their propensity to distribute stress axially, is their ability to share stress applied to one vertex over a large number ot cells. This property could be illustrated by elaborating on the experiments ot p. 3. The property is tully exploited by the space trames discussed Iater in this chapter.\n \n 3.3 Loaded trames.\n \n cubi~\n \n The loaded Frames This interaction between purely geometric stability, the properties of joints, and the axial and transverse strengths of materiais is illustrated in the experiment with loaded trames that I will now describe. Without an appreciation of this interaction the experiment m ig ht appear to be simplistic; with it, as we will see, the experiment is the bridge between abstraction and a concrete functional geometry. The questions betore us are these: How will a nontriangulated (but, by virtue of its joints, rigid) trame compare to a triangulated one under load? Given that each is constructed of the same type and amount of material, which will collapse soonest? Will there be a difference in their behavior on the way to collapse? The comparison of nontriangulated and triangulated trames is taci litated by the relationship of the square-faced cube to the triangular-faced octahedron. Both polyhedra are comprised of 12 edges. Therefore, when a trame of each figure is constructed of strut members ot the same material, diameter, cross-sectional shape and area, and length, they may be considered to be equal in terms of the amount of material they use, or in terms of resource investment. In short, they would weigh and cost the same. Therefore, it is possible, by loading each of these equal weight structures, to directly compare the performance in terms of strength to weight ot nontriangulated and triangulated trameworks.\n \n (a) and octahedral (b)\n \n liiJ\n \n A cube was assembled out of twelve Va\" diameter polyethylene struts each 4%\" long; these were joined at its eight corners by means of rigid metal connectors. An octahedron was also assembled with twel~e of the same struts joined at each ot its six corners with a wire connection that functioned more or less as a multidirectional hinged joint. A plastic container, to contain lead shot, was placed on a plastic panel resting on the upper face of each structure. The plastic pane I was rigid, so that it did not deflect when loaded, and ali loads were transmitted through it to the supporting vertices.\n \n a\n \n b\n \n 23\n \n The Loaded Frames\n \n The tirst sequence in [3.3] shows the gradual collapse ot the loaded cube and the second sequence shows the gradual collapse of the loaded octahedron. The cube collapsed totally under a load of 774 balls of lead shot (1,180 grams) and the octahedron collapsed totally under a load of 1,488 balls (2,269 grams). The octahedron in this experiment is nearly twice as strong with the same amount ot material, even though it was constructed with flexible joints. The octahedron, when loaded with the 77 4 balls of lead shot that caused the cube to collapse, showed little orno sign of distortion dueto bending moments. Bending moments are induced by the rigid joints; it is these moments that give ri se to the \"S\" curves in the struts of the loaded cube. By contrast, the octahedron exhibits no such bending moments. lnstead, a simple are is induced by the axial stress in the members as they reach their compressive limits. We see trom [3.3], that the horizontal members of the octahedral trame do not bend. This is because they are loaded in tension; the hinging joints do not allow the bending of the oblique members to be shared with the horizontal members. lf the joints were rigid, the bending could be shared by ali members, thus increasing the total load capacity of the triangulated framework. Before the point where bending begins, however, it makes no structural difference whether the joints are hinged or rigid. The foregoing experiments were very simple, almost simplistic, but they do demonstrate the structural advantages of triangulated frameworks. One could go on trom here to make increas; ingly complex and sophisticated experiments which might include other variables such as volume and surface area as well as different methods of joining the struts. Ali the same, the inherent advantage of triangulated structures in terms of strength to weight is clearly established.\n \n Space Frames Alexander Graham Bel I discovered in his search for lightweight structures suitable for flight a framework built up from equilateral triangles. This system consists of regular tetrahedra and regular octahedra. Bel I used such structures, not only for his beautiful kites, but also as the basis of a windbreak and an observation tower [3.4]. Bell's essay of 1903 testifies to his awareness of the superior strength per unit weight properties of triangulated structures. Buckminster Fuller, Robert Le Ricolais, and others in recent years have designed structures which utilize this system pioneered by Bell (see McHale 1962; Makowski 1966a).\n \n 24\n \n Bell's kite is an early (though still very useful) example of what has come to be called space trame structure. Space frames are called for when large areas must be spanned; these structures combine lightness and enhanced resistance to bending. They can be recognized by their use of a single, or at most a small number, of strut lengths, joined by means of standardized connections. Because of their high resistance to bending, planar space frames have been typically used for roofs. Although they are justas applicable, they have been rarely used for walls or vertical supports, presumably dueto architectural design constraints (extrinsic forces), rather than dueto the inherent properties of space frames (intrinsic forces). Fuller's geodesic domes and other curved space frames do away, so to speak, with walls and roofs entirely, replacing vertical-compression elements (walls) and bending elements (roofs) by warped surfaces capable of distributing stresses \"isotropically\" throughout the structure. Let us consider the span-todepth ratio of a space frame. This is the ratio of the distance between vertical supporting structures (the span) and the depth or thickness of the frame [3.5]. A 30:1 ratio is generally considered to be the upper limit (Salvadori and Hei ler, p. 126).\n \n Looking at the tetrahedral/octahedral space frame in plan, we note that it fits into a triangular grid. Because of this, it does not appear to be as adaptable to rectilinear structures as certain other systems. The 90° bias of structural designers and architects has prevented a more frequent use of this and other structuresbased upon 60° or 120° grids. The tetrahedral/octahedral space frame can fit into a square grid, but if this is done with a single layer, the octahedra are cut into square pyramids and are not completely stable. This requires the addition of a long diagonal brace on the square face of the half-octahedron, or the use of rigid joints, both of which stratagems can reduce the simplicity and increase the weight of the system.\n \n a\n \n 3.4 Alexander Graham Bell's windbreak (a) and tower (b) (National Geographic Society).\n \n Some Principies of Built Structure\n \n In the 1959 Fuller exhibit at the Museum of Modem Art in New York, a tetrahedral/ octahedral space frame with a depth of approximately 3Vz feet was cantilevered 60 feet. Thus, if supported at two ends, such a system would have a 35:1 spanto-depth ratio. Even this is nota good indication of the potential of space frames. Out of the bias toward 90° geometry, we usually think of supporting space frames at only two (or four) opposite sides. But because space frames are based upon a 60° (or 120°) geometry, they can be conveniently supported on three (or six) sides. This alters the idea of span-todepth ratio, and suggests that ratios greater than 35 :I might be obtainable.*\n \n 3.5 Space trame span-to-depth ratio.\n \n I\n \n I\n \n l\n \n ~T\n \n *For surveys ot space trame systems and their applications see Makowski (1965), Wachsman, and Borrego.\n \n \\\n \n \\ \\.\n \n \\\n \n b\n \n 25\n \n Span\n \n Space Frames\n \n Locallnstability in Planar and Domical Space Frames As discussed in Chapter 1, any convex polyhedron bounded by plane polygons other than triang les suffers from geometrical instability. We can give a polyhedron overa/1 stability against distributed loads -i.e., stability against any load that can be resisted by a large part of the figure via distribution through the structural members of which it is made-by triangulating ali of its faces. However, the structure will still suffer from local instability. This instability arises within the now triangulated, but still planar, faces, because any vertex that is within the boundaries of, and coplanar to, a given face is not rigid with respect to forces directed perpendicular to the face.\n \n So the first way of dealing with local instability isto replace the \"monolayer\" faces by space frames. Thus we have still planar, but now thickened (and triangulated), faces. The second solution isto build up our surface space frame incrementally, by placing the vertices of the triangulating subdivisions above or below the polygon planes so that a periodically convex or concave surface is created. This approach is more economical than the first one, but it introduces additiona:l faceting over the parent polyhedron. Figure [3. 7] shows a faceted figure-a fully triangulated truncated octahedron which has become, in effect, a simple dome. 3. 7 A fully triangulated truncated octahedron.\n \n There are two ways to deal with this condition. 8oth stem from the fact that resistance to a load directed normal to a structure is proportional to the thickness of the structure inthe direction ofthe load. Or, what amounts to the same thing, resistance to compression is greater than resistance to bending. 8oth formulations can be illustrated with a piece of paper. As a sheet, it has virtually no resistance to an applied load. However, if it is folded accordion-style, it becomes rigid [3.6].\n \n One might say that the whole trick to designing successful domes is an awareness of the two methods of dealing with local loads.* The idea of span-to-depth ratio still applies; but in the case of domes we must formulate it by comparing the diameter of the dome to the number ot modular increments (polygons) of whiçh it is made. lf this ratio of circumference to number of modules gets too high, those regions on the dome's surface surrounding single vertices become nearly flat, and thus lose their resistance to concentrated loads. This may be shown schematically by means of polygons inscribed in semicircles [3.8]. For distributed loads, the semicircle's strength is reflected in the very low span-to-depth ratio that, for such loading, is taken as the diameter o ver the height, o r 2:1. However, this says nothing about the semicircle's resistance to concentrated loads. 8ut if the semicircle is divided into two modular increments, it wi/1 have a high resistance to a load concentrated at the vertex. lncreasing the modular frequency gives us more places (vertices) where concentrated loads may be resisted, but, at the same time, because of the increasing planarity in the neighborhoods of vertices, the strength at each vertex is decreasing. *A moment's reflection will show that a structure cannot be made fully stable, i.e., it cannot be fully triangulated, unless it is closed. Spheres and their polyhedral approximations are closed, even when free; whereas domes cannot be considered closed unless they are tied to the ground. The effect of closure upon stability will come up again !ater in this book.\n \n Truss Depth /\n \n ~\n \n 3.6 Folding a sheet increases its resistance to bending.\n \n 26\n \n 3.8 The hemisphere as a truss. lncreasing lhe modular incrementation of lhe truss decreases lhe ability of vertices to resist concentrated loads.\n \n Some Principies of 8uilt Structure\n \n Fuller's geodesic domes have been known'to span over 100ft. with no surface depth at ali, short of the diameter of the tubular metal struts; a balanced response to the conflicting demand for local and overall stability. However, with the 200foot Kaiser dome, faceting was not sufficient to resist the local loads, so the thickened-face space trame solution had to be added [3.9]. Even so, the Kaiser dome required a space trame only one foot deep-a 200:1 \"span-to-depth\" ratio! Fuller combined the advantage of the sphere (resistance to distributed loads) with that of the tetrahedral/octahedral space trame (resistance to local loads), by wrapping the double layer space trame around the sphere. Planarity invites bending moments; and is a generally poor way in which to build. Generally, any curved, and particularly any doubly curved, surface will have higher strength per unit of invested resources than a planar system built of an equivalent amount of the same material. This is a primary reason for the use of curved surfaces or their polyhedral approximations wherever flatness is not absolutely required. In either case, plane or curved, we can assume that triangulation provides the optimum structural framework.\n \n 3.9 Wrapping a space trame around a hemisphere solves the problem of concentrated loads.\n \n 27\n \n Local lnstabi Iity\n \n 4\n \n Ordering Principies and Geometry\n \n ( In this and the following chapter we will study the geometrical basis of the orderly subdivision of space. lf we can inventory ali possible ways in which space can be organized, we will come to know the intrinsic forces that determine the geometric options in three-dimensional space and, hence, can develop a comprehensive morphological system. We will begin by examining tessellations (tilings) of the plane and proceed from this to a description of polyhedra.\n \n Tessellations of the Plane\n \n Regular Tessellations\n \n A plane tessellation is an infinite set of polygons fitting together to cover the whole plane just once, so that every si de of each polygon belongs also to one other polygon (Coxeter 1963). As we shall see later, the plane tessellation is a special case of an infinite polyhedron.\n \n A regular tessellation is a pattern of congruent regular polygons filling the whole plane, on which ali vertices of the tessellation are surrounded alike (uniform). There are only three possible regular tessellations. They are the tessellations of triang les, of squares, and of hexagons. There are no other cases. This can be simply explained by pointing out that in order to subdivide lhe plane with polygons, the angles around each vertex must sum to 360°. In lhe case of regular tessellations this means that only polygons can be used that have face angles that can be whole-number subdivisions of 360°. The triangle, with face angles of 60°, divides 360° into 6 parts; therefore, a tessellation of triangles has six polygons meeting at each vertex. A square, with angles of 90°, divides into 360° into 4 parts; therefore, a tessellation of squares will have four polygons meeting at each vertex. A pentagon has face ang les of 108° which cannot be divided into 360° by a Whole number, and is therefore not capable of tessellating. A hexagon has 120° face angles, which divides 360° into 3 parts; therefore, a tessellation of hexagons will have three polygons meeting at each vertex. Less than three polygons rneeting at a vertex cannot subdivide lhe plane. Therefore, any polygon with face angles greater than 120° wi li not be capable of forming a tessellation.\n \n 4.1 Regular and semiregular tessellations of the plane .\n \n • 28\n \n Semiregular Tessellations\n \n Tessellations with Regular Polygons\n \n There is a second class of planar partitioning known as semi regular tessellations. This class requires that ali polygons be regular, and that ali vertices be congruent, but permits the use of more than one kind of polygon. In this case the 360° around each vertex can be matched by the summed face angles of more than one type of polygon. There are only eight possible cases of semiregular plane tessellations. They consist of various combinations of triangles, squares, hexagons, octagons, and dodecagons (12 sides). One of these, consisting of triang les and ·hexagons, can be assembled in right- or lefthanded form. Such figures (called enantiomorphs) are mirrar images of one another. The regular and semiregular tessellations are illustrated in [4.1].\n \n When some of these conditions of arder are relaxed an entirely new range of possibilities emerges. lf, for example, we only impose the requirement that the entire plane be filled exclusively with regular polygons, but do not require that ali vertices be surrounded by equal angles, we find that we can construct a new class of tessellations in which an infinite number of patterns are possible. lt is surprising to find, however, that there are sti li very few types of polygons that we may use. In fact we may use no more than those that appear in the semiregular tessellations. The reason, of course, is the same as before-each vertex must still be surrounded by exactly 360°, and therefore polygons may be combined around any vertex only when thei r face ang les sum to 360°. Some examples of this infinite class of tessellation are shown in [ 4.2]. 4.2 Tessellations with regular polygons.\n \n 29\n \n Tessellations of the Plane\n \n Tessellations and Symmetry\n \n Though I defer unti I the following chapter a systematic study of the relationship between symmetry and space filling, before we proceed further we will need a working appreciation of the ideas of rotational and mirror symmetry. The rotational symmetry of any figure is determined by counting the number of times it repeats or reproduces itself in one revolution about an axis. Only four kinds of rotational symmetry are possible in the uniform subdivision of space: 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold [ 4.3]. A polygon has mirror symmetry when one si de is the reflection of the other si de about a common line which bisects the polygorl) (This is also known as bilateral symmeily.) lt is possible to uniformly subdivide space with figures having only mirror symmetry and with figures having no symmetry at ali [4.4]. Though the drawings give two-dimensional examples, we shall later see that the same laws of symmetry hold in three dimensions, and that any given three-dimensional uniform structure will consist of various combinations of the four rotational symmetries, the mirror symmetry, and/ or no symmetry.\n \n a\n \n b\n \n c\n \n d\n \n We have seen that the regular pentagon will not serve as a tile in the regular tessellation of the plane. Another way of saying this is that figures cannot repeat themselves on 5-fold axes of symmetry. There is a distorted pentagon which will tile the plane, but it has only mirror symmetry [ 4.5]. 4.5 A mirror-symmetric pentagon that fills the plane.\n \n 4.6 Open patterns with regular polygons.\n \n 4.4 Tessellations of polygons with mirrar symmetry (a) and no symmetry (b).\n \n b\n \n 30\n \n lf we eliminate the requirements that ali of the plane be filled and that ali vertices be congruent, but simply consider periodic subdivisions of the plane, with regular polygons, a third class of possibilities emerges. With the remova! of the need to fi li ali spaces with polygons, it is no longer necessary that we use polygons with face angles that can be combined to give 360°. We will still have 360° at each vertex; it is just that a vertex does not have to be entirely surrounded by regular polygons. Such a condition gives rise to \"open spaces\" of non-regular polygons, many of which are concave. In this class, polygons of 5, 9, 1O, and 20 sides may be used. Some examples are shown in [ 4.6]* *These examples were the results of some empírica! studies conducted by the author with 2nd year architecture students at the University of Southern California.\n \n 4.3 Tessellations of polygons with n-fold symmetries: 2-fold (a), 3-fold (b), 4-fold (c), and 6-fold (d).\n \n a\n \n Open Patterns with Regular Polygons\n \n Ordering Principies and Geometry\n \n Dual Tessellations\n \n Concentric Patterns with Regular Pentagons\n \n Although the pentagon does not tessellate the plane, it has the curious property that it generates infinite concentrically repeating open patterns [ 4. ?a]. Such concentric open patterns have only one axis of rotational symmetry, about the center of the central pentagon-the only one which shares ali of its edges with other pentagons. This kind of pattern is quite different from an infinite tessellation of regular hexagons where ali cells are symmetrically equivalent, i.e., the environment around each cell is like that around every other. A variety of concentric patterns can be assembled with pentagons and I or decagons [4.7b]. Because the decagon has twice as many sides as a pentagon, their symmetry properties are similar. We observe there are two great classes of regular figures: first, pentagons, septagons, decagons, etc., that give rise to concentric packing systems; and second, tri ang les, sq uares, hexagons, nonagons, etc., that repeat inthe plane in true crystallographic fashion-that is, with no unique center of symmetry. Only those regular polygons with numbers of sides that are divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6 are capable of infinite repetition in the plane, i.e., only those regular polygons having multi pies of 2, 3, 4, or 6-fold symmetry can be the basis of a periodic open pattern. Here Iam considering the general case, in which it is not required that a// the space be fi lled with regular polygons-only that the polygons could be fit together to generate a repetitive pattern. We can further surmise that any regular polygon which is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, or 6 will be capable of generating concentric patterns with a center of symmetry. From this it is apparent that any regular polygon that is divisible by 5 can generate concentric patterns with a uni que axis of symmetry for the infinite array.\n \n The concept of the reciproca! or dual network was important to our discussion of closest packed systems. As we shall see, it is also fundamental to the understanding of the properties of ali periodic spatial systems. We have already noted the duality of triangular networks and hexagonal networks. A dual network is formed by joining the centers of each polygon to ali neighboring polygons through the shared edges. Only one of the regular and semiregular plane tessellations is dual to itself-namely, the square grid. The dual network always forms polygons which are the domains of the vertices; i.e., polygonal domains will have the same number of edges as there are edges meeting at the vertex it encloses.* Any network of a plane tessellation with congruent vertices will have a unique plane-filling domain formed by its dual network. In the case of the array of squares, there are four edges meeting at each vertex at 90°. When the centers of each square face are joined with edges to the centers of ali neighboring squares, another array of squares is generated. The polygonal domain of the vertex is a square. Since the tessellations of triangles and hexagons are dual to each other, they form the polygonal domains of each other's networks. In the case of the semi regular tessellations, the dual networks form congruent polygons, but none are regular. Each polygonal domain is capable of repeating itself to fi li the plane. Of the eight cases only one has rotational symmetry (2-fold), one has no symmetry and six have mirror symmetry\n \n [4.8]. *These two-dimensional polygonal domains are analogous to the three-dimensional polyhedral domains discussed in Chapter I, pp. 8-9.\n \n Periodic structures generated as open patterns of regular polygons is a subject that, to my knowledge, has been little studied and has only been briefly investigated here.\n \n 31\n \n Tessellations of the Plane\n \n a\n \n b\n \n 4. 7 Concentric repeating patterns with regular pentagons (a), and regular pentagons I regular decagons (b). 4.8 Dual networks of regular and semi regular tessellations.\n \n t-\n \n -j --j-\n \n -t- +1-+\n \n -~\n \n -+--\n \n +-+ -t- + -+ -+ +- + -+- + -+·1-t +- +-i- -r- +-i L _ _j_\n \n I\n \n I\n \n Polyhedra and Their Duais\n \n Regular Polyhedra and Their Duais\n \n As mentioned earlier, in the plane ifis necessary that ali vertices be surrounded by polygons whose face ang les sum to 360°. In a finite polyhedron it is necessary that ali vertices be surrounded by polygons whose face angles sum to less than 360°; thus a three-dimensional convex figureis formed. When ali of the vertices of such a polyhedron share a common sphere it may be considered to be a finite tessellation of the sphere. *\n \n The first important class of polyhedra are those that are convex and regular. They are composed of regular and equal polygonal faces with ali of their vertices equivalently surrounded. There are only five possible cases, the so called Platonic solids, discussed in Chapter 1 (see\n \n *An example of a fundamental space relationship that can be expressed algebraically is Euler's theorem for polyhedra. lt states that for any polyhedron that is singly connected with nonintersecting faces, lhe number of faces (P), the number of vertices (V), and lhe number of edges (E), satisfythe equation P+V= E+ 2. This concisely states lhe fact that there is always a consistent relationship among lhe inventory of components of any finite modular structure. For example, the tetrahedrón has 4 faces plus 4 vertices which equal its 6 edges plus 2. The octahedron has 8 faces plus 6 vertices which equal12 edges plus 2, etc. In t t dimensions the equation changes slightly. I any finite arbitrary sample of an infinite plane essellation, the number of polygons, lhe number of vertices, and the number of edges satisfy P + V= E + 1 (see footnote, p. 12). In any random or symmetrical array of packed polygons this relationship holds.\n \n [U]). Justas it is possible to generate dual networks for the plane tessellations, it is possible to generate polyhedral duais. The dual polyhedron is formed in a manner analogous to that described for the plane tessellation. However, for polyhedra the reciprocation process is somewhat more complicated: a point perpendicularly above the center of each face of a given polyhedron is joined with new edges to similar points above ali neighboring faces such that the new edges that connect these points intersect the edges of the original polyhedron, thus forming the edges of a new dual polyhedron [ 4.9]. This pair of dual polyhedra must enclose a common sphere that is tangent to both, at the points where their respective edges intersect. lt is usually true that the respective edges of dual polyhedra perpendicularly bisect each other. lt follows from this process of reciprocation that any given polyhedron and its dual will have the same number of edges, and the inventaries of faces and vertices will be exactly reversed.\n \n 4.9 Dual regular polyhedra.\n \n 32\n \n Ordering Principies and Geometry\n \n We saw that of the plane tessellations the only self-dual was the array of squares. There is only one polyhedron that is a self-dual. lt is the regular tetrahedron, which is the only figure to have the same number of vertices as faces. The cube and the regular octahedron are dual. They each have twelve edges, and the cuba has six faces and eight vertices, while the octahedron has eight faces and six vertices. The pentagonal dodecahedron and icosahedron are dual. They each have thirty edges. Whi Ie the dodecahedron has twelve faces and twenty vertices, the icosahedron has twenty faces and twelve vertices. Like the regular plane tessellations, the duais of regular polyhedra are also regular polyhedra, which is a unique property of these regular figures. The duality of the regular polyhedra is shown in [4.9].\n \n Semiregular Polyhedra and Their Duais\n \n The existence of the semiregular plane tessellations suggests an equivalent class of polyhedra. The semiregular polyhedra, like their two-dimensional counterparts, require that ali polygons be regular but not equal, and that ali vertices be equivalently surrounded. A set of thirteen semiregular figures are usually referred to as the Archimedean solids, since Archimedes was supposedly the first to have studied them. Archimedes' book on the subject has been lost. Kepler made the first complete investigation of ali possible semiregular polyhedra.\n \n 4.1 O a b c d e f g h i j k I m\n \n The thirteen Archimedean polyhedra consist of various combinations of triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons, octagons, and decagons. Recai! that neither the pentagon nor decagon appear in the plane tessellations, and note that the dodecagon, which does appear in the plane tessellations, does not appear in any of these polyhedra. No single polyhedron is constructed of ali six types of polygons. Ten of these Archimedean figures utilize only two kinds of polygons, and the remaining three utilize three kinds of polygons. These thirteen polyhedra are shown in [4.10].\n \n The thirteen Archimedean polyhedra: Truncated tetrahedron Cuboctahedron Snub cuboctahedron Truncated octahedron Rhombicuboctahedron Truncated cube Truncated cuboctahedron Truncated icosahedron lcosidodecahedron Snub icosidodecahedron Rhombicosidodecahedron Truncated dodecahedron Truncated icosidodecahedron\n \n 33\n \n Polyhedra and their Duais\n \n For each of the convex regular and semiregular polyhedra, ali vertices fali on a common sphere. That is, the vertices of any one of these polyhedra are always equidistant from a common center. Ali of the Archimedean polyhedra can be derived from the five Platonic figures by truncations (cutting off) of vertices and I or edges. The obvious examples are the truncated tetrahedron, truncated octahedron, truncated cube, truncated dodecahedron, and the truncated icosahedron. The cuboctahedron can be simply derived from the truncation of the cube or octahedron, etc. Careful examination will reveal that ali the Archimedean polyhedra can be generated by means of such truncations.\n \n The duais of the Archimedean polyhedra exhibit many similarities to the duais of the semiregular tessellations. No dual to an Archimedean polyhedron is composed of regular polygons o r even necessari ly of polygons of equal edge, but ali of its faces are congruent. The inventory of faces consists of three-, four-, and fivesided polygons which appear with the following symmetries: two with 2-fold symmetry (rhombic faces), nine with mirrar symmetry, and two with no symmetry. Seven of the thirteen dual polyhedra are bounded by congruent triang les and for this reason some have more than passing interest for our study. Ali thirteen of the dual polyhedra are shown and named in\n \n [4.11].\n \n b\n \n 4.11\n \n Duais of lhe Archimedean polyhedra:\n \n Figure a Triakis tetrahedron b Rhombic dodecahedron c Pentagonal icositetrahedron d Tetrakis hexahedron e Trapezoidal icositetrahedron f Triakis octahedron g Hexakis octahedron h Pentakis dodecahedron i Rhombic triacontahedron j Pentagonal hexecontahedron k Trapezoidal hexecontahedron I Triakis icosahedron m Hexakis icosahedron\n \n Dual of Truncated tetrahedron Cuboctahedron Snub cuboctahedron Truncated octahedron Rhombicuboctahedron Truncated cube Truncated cuboctahedron Truncated icosahedron lcosidodecahedron Snub icosidodecahedron Rhombicosidodecahedron Truncated dodecahedron Truncated icosidodecahedron\n \n 34\n \n Ordering Principies and Geometry\n \n The two figures with rhombic faces, the rhombic dodecahedron and the rhombic triacontahedron, are particularly significant as they are the only duais which have equal edge lengths. We recai! from ou r study of cell aggregates that the rhombic dodecahedron is an often-metwith space filling polyhedron.\n \n Unlike the semiregular tessellations, there are two infinite groups consisting of the prisms and antiprisms, in addition to the Archimedean figures. The prisms and antiprisms correspond to the infinite number of possible polygons. A semiregular prism is made up of two parai lei regular polygons of any number of sides, connected in equatorial fashion by square faces [4.12]. The antiprisms are likethe prisms except that the equatorial polygons are equilateral triang les [ 4.13]. Two of the regular polyhedra fali into one each of these categories. The cube is a square prism, and the octahedron is a triangular antiprism. The duais of prisms are called the dipyramids (double pyramids), whose faces are congruent isosceles triangles [4.14]. The duais ofthe antiprisms are called trapezohedra andare double pyramid-like figures bounded by congruent trapezia [ 4.15].\n \n (\n \n Before we can proceed further, I must define the dihedral angle. The dihedral angle is the angle formed between the planes of two adjacent polygons, the angle taken in a plane perpendicular to the common edge [4.16]. Ali ofthe dihedral angles for each of the regular polyhedra are equal. However, of the semiregular polyhedra, only the cuboctahedron and the icosidodecahedron have equal dihedral angles. There are nine Archimedean figures which have two dihedral angles and two which have three. The dihedral angle will become quite an important concept as we consider the problem of space filling polyhedra.* *For a complete atlas of specifications including angular data for regular and semi regular polyhedra see Cundy and Rollett.\n \n 4.12 Semiregular prisms.\n \n 4.14 Dipyramids, the duais of prisms.\n \n 4.13 Semiregular antiprisms.\n \n 4.15 Trapezohedra, the duais of antiprisms.\n \n 4.16 Dihedral angle: the angle formed between planes. \\\n \n \\\n \n \\\n \n 35\n \n Polyhedra and their Duais\n \n Compound, Quasiregular, and Stellated Polyhedra When the cube and octahedron are interlinked with their edges bisecting each other at right ang les, a compound polyhedron is formed. The 14 apices of this compound polyhedron are the 14 vertices of the rhombic dodecahedron. The edges of the compound figure form the long and short diagonais of the rhombic faces of the dodecahedron [ 4.17]. When the pentagonal (regular) dodecahedron and icosahedron are interlinked in similar fashion, the resulting 32 apices are the vertices of the rhombic triacontahedron and its edges form the long and short diagonais of the rhombic faces of the triacontahedron [ 4.18]. Two tetrahedra (remember, the tetrahedron is self-dual) can be inter! inked to form a compound called by Kepler the stella octangula. lts eight apices are the vertices of a cube and its edges are the diagonais of the cube faces [ 4.19]. lt is illuminating to consider the polyhedra which form the centers or nuclei of the foregoing three compounds. The stella octangula can be formed by placing eight regular tetrahedra on the faces of a regular octahedron. The cube-and-octahedron compound has a cuboctahedron as its nucleus. The compound can be formed when six square pyramids and eight triangular pyramids are placed on the faces of the cuboctahedron (assuming, of course, that the proper face ang les are used for the triangular faces of the pyramids). The icosahedron-anddodecahedron has as its nucleus the icosidodecahedron. The compound can be formed by placing twenty triangular pyramids and twelve pentagonal pyramids on the faces of the icosidodecahedron, again assuming that the pro per angles are used. These three polyhedra, the octahedron, the cuboctahedron, and icosidodecahedron, are sometimes known as the quasiregular polyhedra.\n \n Such a polyhedron has ali of its dihedral ang les equal, its vertices are congruent, and its faces are of two kinds, each face of one kind being entirely surrounded by the faces of the other kind. Ali three cases have four-connected vertices and they are the only examples of regular and semiregular figures to have plane equatorial polygons. The octahedron is quasiregular only when its triangular faces are treated as two subsets of four each, such that three of one set always surround one of the other set. The duais of these quasiregular polyhedra are the figures generated by the compounds for which they form nuclei. The cube is dual to the octahedron; the rhombic dodecahedron is dual to the cuboctahedron; and the rhombic triacontahedron is dual to the icosidodecahedron.\n \n The intersection of faces reflects a relatively more abstract concept of space than we have heretofore discussed, simply because it is physically impossible to achieve without actually cutting up the polygons into irregular parts. In the formal classification of these stellated forms, the intersecting polygons form new edges and vertices which are not counted in fhe inventory of properties. Although these stellated forms have some morphological interest, they are of minar importance in the present study. They will contribute little to our theory of spatial modularity. *See also Coxeter et ai., 1938, for a discussion of a special family of stellated polyhedra derived from lhe icosahedron.\n \n We have so far limited our discussion of regular and semiregular polyhe:dra to convex figures composed of convex regular plane polygons. There is a very large class of nonconvex uniform polyhedra. They are loosely referred to as stellated polyhedra. A detailed account of these figures can be found in \"Uniform Polyhedra\" (Coxeter, Lonquet-Higgins, and Miller 1954), where, in addition to the regular and semiregular convex polyhedra, fiftyseven other polyhedra are described.* Among these are four stellated forms known as the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are those that have regular faces. However, because their faces and edges intersect, these forms are generally far more complex than the simple convex polyhedra. Although they are composed of plane polygons, because of the intersections multifaceted polyhedra are formed with both convex and concave regions. This is characteristic of ali of the stellated polyhedra.\n \n 4.17 Rhombic dodecahedron formed as a compound of lhe cube and octahedron.\n \n ( ~\n \n 4.18 Rhombic triacontahedron formed as a compound of lhe pentagonal dodecahedron and lhe icosahedron. 4.19 Cube formed as a compound of two tetrahedra.\n \n 36\n \n Ordering Principies and Geometry\n \n Convex Polyhedra Composed of Regular Polygons\n \n So far we have seen that by restricting ourselves to regular, convex plane polygons and a uniformity of vertices for any given figure, the class of possible types of polyhedra that can be formed is very limited: the five Platonic, the thirteen Archimedean polyhedra, and the two infinite families of prisms and antiprisms. lf we relax the requirement of uniformity short of the use of regular plane polygons (as we did with the plane tessellations), does this give rise to another set of possible polyhedra? We saw that there is no apparent limit to the number of different tessellation pàtterns which can be assembled with the five regular polygons that qualify as tiles. However, in the case of convex polyhedra ther~ are a surprisingly small number of possibilities. Johnson (1966) has propo~ed that in addition to the regular and semiregular polyhedra there are just 92 others. lt is remarkable to realize that the only kinds of faces that a regular-faced solid (beyond prisms and antiprisms) may have are triang les, squares, pentagons, hexagons, octagons, and decagons. The most surprising thing of ali is that the list of allowable polygons is precisely the same as that for the regular and semiregular polyhedra. This is another example of a minumum inventory of components that wi I! yield diversity of form.\n \n lt is possible with an inventory of six regu\\ lar polygons to assemble exactly 120 ) convex polyhedra, including the appropriate finite set of prisms and antiprisms. Of these 120, there are only 1O convex polyhedra that can be made which have congruent regular faces. In addition to the five Platonic polyhedra, there are five others ali bounded by equilateral triangles, although it is only in the Platonic figures that ali vertices are equidistant from a common center. Of these ten polyhedra, ali but the cube and the dodecahedron have triangular faces. We have already noted a special interest in triangulated polyhedra, because of their effectiveness as physical structures, and we can now enumerate ali eight cases of convex deltahedra (polyhedra bounded by equilateral triangles). The convex deltahedra are as follows: tetrahedron-four faces; triangular dipyramid-six faces; octahedron-eight; pentagonal dipyramid-ten; snub disphenoidtwelve; triaugmented triangular prismfourteen; gyroelongated square dipyramid-sixteen; and icosahedrontwenty faces. These are shown in [ 4.20]. The names of the twelve-, fourteen-, and sixteen-hedra are dueto Johnson (1966).\n \n a\n \n 4.20 a b c d e f g h\n \n The convex deltahedra: Tetrahedron (4-hedron) Triangular dipyramid (6-hedron) Octahedron (8-hedron) Pentagonal dipyramid (1 0-hedron) 12-hedron 14-hedron 16-hedron lcosahedron (20-hedron)\n \n 37\n \n Convex Polyhedra\n \n We have now a prototypical array of geometric structures that reveals a richness and diversity within the constraints of an extraordinary order. lt seems at times almost unbelievable, for example, that there can be only five convex regular polyhedra. This may seem to be a frustrating limitation. However, I hope to show that it is rather a beautiful and useful phenomenon. Without knowledge of these geometric structures and their relationships, the possibility of developing a comprehensive morphological system for modular structures is nil.\n \n b\n \n c\n \n d\n \n e\n \n g\n \n h\n \n 5\n \n Symmetry and Space Filling\n \n With this underlying background in plane tessellations and finite polyhedra, we must now move to a subject which, if it is not the most exciting in ali geometry, is certainly of the highest importance in our search for a theory of modularity: the concept of space filling polyhedra, which ultimately leads us to the general properties of three-dimensional periodic space. By space filling is meant the packing together of closed three-dimensional bodies in an unbounded or infinite array such that ali the space is occupied without intersections of contiguous cells. The obvious question comes to the fore: with an inventory of finite polyhedra on hand, which, if any, will pack together to fi li ali space? The question has even more importance than may be immediately apparent as it must be noted from the outset that there is no limit to the number of possible space filling polyhedra. This isto emphasize that the discovery of previously unknown space filling polyhedra is of no particular significance in itself. Space filling polyhedra (old or new) only have significance in the degree to which they relate to some ordering principie. Whether such ordering principies are derived from mathematical criteria or physical constraints or both is immaterial, so longas the determining parameters are well defined. The real significance of the space filling polyhedra is therefore related to the significance of the ordering principies themselves. For the moment we are content to examine space filling possibilities within the constraints that have evolved through the historical search for ordering principies in nature and in mathematics. Hence the Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra are considered. Later in this examination some new possibilities are proposed based on parameters which have developed from the goals of the present work.\n \n 38\n \n Symmetry Classes\n \n The cube is the only Platonic polyhedron that will repeat to fi li ali space. lt is the most symmetrical variation on the infinite class of three-dimensional figures known as parallelepipeds. The parallelepipeds are prisms whose bases and sides arE;) parallelograms; they are, therefore, sixfaced polyhedra. Any parallelepiped will fi li space by the congruent repetition of itself [5.1 ]. The subdivision of space by means of congruent parallelepipeds may be characterized in terms of six symmetry classes or systems. These classes form six of the seven crystal systems of crystallography. The seven crystal classes rely upon various combinations of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 6-fold or no rotational symmetry; together, they provide a . descriptive scheme of space partitioning. As already mentioned, the cube is the most symmetrical case; that is, it has the greatest number of symmetry axes of any parallelepiped or parallelohedron. A cube has three axes of 4-fold symmetry, four axes of 3-fold symmetry, and six axes of 2-fold symmetry [5.2a]. This is a consequence not only of the fact that a cube's face and dihedral angles are ali equal to 90°, but also of the fact that ali of its edges are equal. lt will be noted that only the cube is metrically determinate in these seven symmetry classes; i.e., it is the only parallelepiped in which there is a unique set of dimensional relationships that cannot be varied without destroying some aspect of its symmetry. The six parallelepiped classes can be generated by making a series of systematic changes in the edge lengths and face angles of the cube while preserving only parallelism. Three sets of parai lei planes are defined by the faces of any parallelepiped. 5.1 Any paral1elepiped will fill space by repetition.\n \n The next most symmetrical parallelepiped class after the cube is the tetragonal system. A tetragonal parallelepiped, like the cube, is also a square prism. Ali of its face angles are 90°. lt differs from the cube in only one regard-its height will be either greater or less than its base but not equal to its base. The tetragonal system has one axis of 4-fold symmetry and four axes of 2-fold symmetry [5.2b]. In the orthorhombic system ali face angles are still 90°, but the base has two unequal sides making it a rectangle rather than a square; and the height is yet a third length. The orthorhombic system has only three 2-fold axes of symmetry [5.2c].\n \n The monoclinic system is nonrectangular on one set of planes, with the other two sets of planes rectangular. lt has only one 2-fold axis of symmetry [5.2d]. Although the trigonal system has no 90° angles, ali of its edges are équal and ali of its six faces are congruent. This gives rise to one 3-fold axis of symmetry making it slightly more symmetrical than the monoclinic [5.2e]. The triclinic system has no symmetry. lt has no 90° angles, and only those edges, and therefore faces, which are parallel are equal [5.2f].\n \n The hexagonal system is based upon the right hexagonal prism. This prism has six right parallelograms for sides and two re~ar hexagons parallel to each other on opposite ends. lt is nota parallelepiped, but is a parallelohedron because only its sides are parallelograms rather than its bases and sides. The hexagonal system has one 6-fold axis and six 2-fold axes of symmetry [5.2g]. lt is considered the most symmetrical system after the cube.* *We can rank lhe various symmetry classes by considering lhe total number of symmetry axes of each class: 1. Cubic-13 axes; 2. Hexagonal-? axes; 3. Tetragonal-5 axes; 4. Orthorhombic-3 axes; 5. Trigonal-1 axis; 6. Monoclinic-1 axis; 7. Triclinic-no symmetry axes.\n \n a\n \n c\n \n b\n \n e\n \n d\n \n g\n \n 5.2 The seven symmetry classes: cubic (a); tetragonal (b); orthorhombic (c); monoclinic (d); trigonal (e); triclinic (f); hexagonal (g).\n \n 39\n \n Symmetry Classes\n \n Lattices and Unit Cells In 1848 Bravais showed that there was a maximum of fourteen space lattices or groups of points differing by symmetry and geometry whose translational repetition in space maintained the symmetrical arrangements of the points of a unit cell. Bravais perceived that these fourteen space lattices corresponded to seven crystal symmetry classes.* In these seven crystal symmetry classes, the parallelepiped (or hex prism)** is the unit ce/1 or elementary repeat unit. In crystallography, a unit cell is defined as the basic repeating unit or module that, by simple translation, will define the infinite structure. Translation is a fundamental symmetry operation in which a given unit is repeated by sliding it along an axis or set of axes. Such axes are usually the set described by the edges of a given parallelepiped defined by the unit cell.\n \n In the cubic system, there can be an additional lattice site placed at the center of the unit cell, thus forming the body centered cubic lattice (bcc). Or, lattice sites can be placed forming the face centered cubic lattices (fcc) [5.3]. In the tetragonal system, in addition to the primitive lattice, it is only possible to have a body centered lattice. However, in the orthorhombic system three other lattices are possible in addition to the primitive. Body centered and face centered lattices are augmented by a lattice with sites added only on two opposite and parai lei faces of the unit cell. The system is usually designated C-face centered orthorhombic or simply orthorhombic-C. In the monoclinic system, only a similar C-face centered lattice appears, bringing the total number of lattices up to fourteen\n \n [5.4].\n \n When points are placed at the corners of a given unit cell, aprimitive lattice is formed. These points are called lattice sites. These lattice sites are symmetrically equivalent in the sense that they have identical surroundings or environments, i.e., each lattice site is equivalent to every other lattice site. For four of the seven primitive lattices, we can add additional points to face centers and cell body centers so that more lattices can be formed in which ali the points are symmetrically equivalent.\n \n Despite the fact that the unit cells and lattices are usually illustrated as parallelepipeds or parallelohedra with edges, from a crystallographer's point of view it is only the lattice sites that are of concern. There is usually no consideration of the nature of the connections between the lattice sites. Because of this the concept of.the lattice as understood by crystallographers issomewhat abstract; nevertheless, we will find that the foregoing identification of the seven crystal classes will have its role to play in our development of a morphological system for the organization of physical components in space.* The three cubic lattices-primitive, bcc, and fccare the most significant Bravais lattices in the sense that when each lattice point is connected to each of its nearest neighbors with edges, important fundamental three-dimensional networks result. Of the fourteen Bravais lattices, these cubic systems will be given the greatest emphasis in the remainder of this book. *For a discussion of the relationships between point arrays and connected networks (a polyhedron can be considered a connected network), see Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen's Chapter 11.\n \n 5.4 Tetragonal, trigonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic, triclinic, and hexagonallattices.\n \n *lt was determined by Federov (1880) and independently by Schoenflies (1891) that with the 14 Bravais lattices it was possible to generate by means of various symmetry operations \"space groups\" constituting only 230 possible symmetrical ways of arranging points in space. lt is these 230 space groups that form the heart of the analysis of crystals.

Among the Archimedean polyhedra and the infinite family of prisms and antiprisms, we find that there are exactly three space fillers: the truncated octahedron, the hexagonal prism, and the triangular prism. We are already familiar with the packings of the truncated octahedron from our discussion of the geometry of closest packed cells [1.7b]. Recai! that it isthe space filling polyhedron with the least interface area. As we have already noted, in space filling array ali of its vertices are identical, with four edges meeting at each point. The space filling triangular and hexagonal prisms are generated from the plane tessellations of triangles and hexagons [5.5]. ! Of th~ thirteen Archimedean duais, only the rhombic dodecahedron will fill ali space. lt was mentioned along with the truncated octahedron in our discussion of naturally occurring cellular structures [1. ?a]. Among the duais of the prisms and antiprisms (dipyramids and trapezohedra}, there are no space fillers. Of the class of 92 finite polyhedra bounded by regular polygons, there are also no known space fillers. Both the rhombic dodecahedron and truncated octahedron have fui I cubic symmetry [5.6]. The hexagonal prism has one axis of 6-fold symmetry and six axes of 2-fold symmetry. The triangular prism has one axis of 3-fold symmetry and three axes of 2-fold symmetry. Within this set of tive space filling polyhedra-cube, truncated octahedron, hexagonal prism, triangular prism, and rhombic dodecahedron-we find only 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold symmetry axes.\n \n 5.5 Space filling triangular (a) and hexagonal (b) prisms. 5.6 The rhombic dodecahedron and truncated octahedron have fui I cubic symmetry.\n \n B\n \n Symmetry is not the only factor that allows us to discover candidates for space fi li i ng. Another factor i s the com p lementarity of adjacent dihedral ang les. In a space filling array of polyhedra the dihedral angles formed by faces meeting around a common edge must sum to 360°. This is equivalent to the requirement of 360° around each vertex of a plane tessellation.\n \n Rhombic Dodecahedron\n \n Truncated Octahedron\n \n 2-foldaxis\n \n 41\n \n Space Filling Polyhedra\n \n 3-foldaxis\n \n 4-fold axis\n \n The Tetrahedron and Octahedron and Space Filling\n \n There is no mystery concerning the cube as a space fi Iler, but it is use fui to examine the properties of the other four regular polyhedra to see if there are clear reasons why they will not fi li space. Because the octahedron is the dual of the cube, it has the same symmetry. However, it will not fi li space. Although the symmetry is there, its dihedral angle of 109° 28' makes it impossible for the octahedron to pack with itself to occupy ali of space. We have already noted, however, that octahedra will combine with tetrahedra to forma fully triangulated network, which in tum describes a space filling array of these polyhedra. This structure is the dual network of the packing of rhombic dodecahedra and it is the lattice which positions equal spheres in closed packed array. In fact, this structure is an fcc lattice [5.3, 5.1 Oa].\n \n Octahedra and tetrahedra will fill space when packed in the ratio of 1:2. This is easily shown by placing tetrahedra on two opposite faces of an octahedron. The result is a space filling parallelepiped with six rhombic faces with ang les of 120° and 60° [5. 7]. lt should be noted that the tetrahedron's faces are parai lei to half of the faces of the octahedron, and this explains the ability to forma multi pie space filling system. The dihedral angle of the tetrahedron is 70°32', which is compatible with the 109°28' dihedral angle of the octahedron: combining two tetrahedra and two octahedra around a common edge accounts for 360°. The tetrahedron is less symmetrical than the octahedron (or cube). lt has four axes of 3-fold symmetry and three axes of 2-fold symmetry [5.8]. Because they are symmetrically equivalent, either the cube or the octahedron may be used to identify figures with sim i lar symmetry, i. e., the same figure may be designated as having octahedral or cubic symmetry. Because the cube is the space fi i ler, and presumably beca use it is more familiar, the term cubic symmetry is more generally used.\n \n The lcosahedron and Dodecahedron and Space Filling\n \n The icosahedron and the dodecahedron are dual to each other so they have the same symmetry. The icosahedron is the most symmetrical of ali possible polyhedra. lt is mathematically and physically impossible to describe or construct a polyhedron of higher symmetry. The icosahedron has twenty equilateral triangular faces. There is no convex polyhedron with more than twenty identical regular faces. A triangular face may be divided into six congruent right triangles. When this is done on each face of the icosahedron, a polyhedron can be derived which has 120 congruent faces. This is the greatest number of identical modules which can be used to form a closed polyhedron. The icosahedron becomes, therefore, the most symmetrical system for the subdivision of a spherical surface into modular units. As I pointed out in Chapter 2 it is this property of high symmetry that Fui ler has exploited with his geodesic domes and which many vírus structures take advantage of. However, this high symmetry makes it impossible to fi li space with an icosahedron. * *Coxeter, DuVal, and Petrie have shown that the icosahedron can generate 59 stellated forms dueto its high symmetry. No other polyhedron can generate that many derivativa forms.\n \n 5.7 Two tetrahedra and one octahedron combine to forma space filling parallelipiped. 5.8 Symmetry axes of the regular tetrahedron: four 3-fold axes and three 2-fold axes.\n \n 42\n \n Symmetry and Space Filling\n \n The icosahedron has the following axes of symmetry: six 5-fold axes, ten 3-fold axes, and fifteen 2-fold axes [5.9]. Since the dodecahedron is the dual of the icosahedron, it has the same symmetry. We note that these two figures have six axes of 5-fold symmetry. lt has already been shown in the discussion of plane tessellations that regular pentagons cannot be combined to fi li the plane. Only figures with 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold symmetry can subdivide space. In spite of the fact that the pentagonal dodecahedron appears as if it might fi li space, it will not quite do it. lts face angles are 108° (very close to the tetrahedral angles of 109°28'), and its dihedral angles are 116°34' (which is close to the 120° angle found in plane tessellations). The fact that the icosahedron and dodecahedron have elements of 2-fold and 3-fold symmetry suggests that they may have some capability of spatial periodicity, if not complete space filling. Such questions are explored Iater, along with distortions of these two figure~, made in order to accomplish at least approximate space filling.\n \n Regular and Semiregular Polyhedra as Multiple Space Fillers A multiple space filling system is one in which thereis more than one kind of polyhedron. As we have just seen, among the tive Platonic polyhedra, the only multi pie space filling system is one composed of tetrahedra and octahedra. However, there are also multiple space filling systems which utilize, in various combinations, both the regular and semi regular polyhedra. The first requirement of multiple space filling is that different polyhedra must have matching parai lei faces in common. With this in mind, it becomes readily apparent that the semi regular duais do not qualify, as no two figures have the same faces in common. Of the thirteen Archimedean figures, six are derived from the icosahedron and consequently have fui I icosahedral symmetry which disqualifies them, even from multi pie space filling systems. Of the remaining seven, one-the truncated tetrahedron-has tetrahedral symmetry and the other sixcuboctahedron, truncated octahedron, truncated cube, rhombicuboctahedron, truncated cuboctahedron, and snub cuboctahedron-have fui I cubic symmetry. Of these six, the snub cuboctahedron has extra faces which are not parailei to the faces of any of the others. lt is, therefore, disqualified.\n \n 5.9 Symmetry of the icosahedron and its dual, the pentagonal dodecahedron.\n \n 2-foldaxis\n \n 3-fold axis\n \n 43\n \n Of the Archimedean and Platonic figures, then, there are altogether nine polyhedra that qualify as candidates for multip le space filling systems. In the larger class of semiregular polyhedra, which includes the prisms as well as the Archimedean figures, a look at the semiregular plane tessellations reveals which of the prisms will qualify for multiple space filling. We have already seen that triang les, squares, hexagons, octagons, and dodecagons are the only polygons that can combine in various arrangements to form plane tessellations [4.1]. Any polygon can be used for the ends of a right prism, and if ali the sides are taken to be squares, we have a collection of semiregular polyhedra. (The cube, of course, is regular.) From this, it follows that triangular, hexagonal, octagonal, and dodecagonal prisms qualify as candidates for multiple space filling systems. Further, the eight semi regular tessellations can be considered multiple space filling systems which combine up to three different cell shapes, e.g., cube, hexagonal prism, and dodecagonal prism. Recai I that the semi regular tessellations have ali their vertices congruent and that if this requirement is waived, there can be an infinite number of plane tessellations composed of regular polygons. The same principie holds with the space filling prisms, i.e., there is an infinite number of multiple systems once the requirement of congruent vertices is abandoned. In the interest of simplicity we will only consider the uniform cases on the assumption that the most interesting nonuniform permutations are derived from them.\n \n tcosahedron\n \n We can classify multiple space filling systems according to how many different types of polyhedra the systems require. A space filling system consisting of one type of polyhedron is c.alled a unary space filling system. Multi pie systems consisting of two, three, and four types of polyhedra are called binary, ternary, and quaternary space fi lling systems, respectively.*\n \n Dodecahedron\n \n *I have discovered no system composed exclusively of regular and semi regular figures that utilizes more than four types of polyhedra.\n \n 5-foldaxis\n \n Regular and Semiregular Polyhedra\n \n In addition to the eight multiple-prism (from the semi regular tessellations) space filling systems, there are eleven more space filling possibilities utilizing the Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra. These eleven are shown in [5.1 O].* These range from the binary tetrahedral I octahedral system to the quaternary system composed of the rhombicuboctahedron, octagonal prism, truncated cube, and cube. Unlike the multiple prism packings, these systems do not give ri se to infinite numbers of space filling permutations. There is a simple reason for this. Only the cube, out of the nine polyhedra in this class, can be repeated to forma larger version of itself. In the case of the prism forms (including the cube again) of the five qualifying polyhedra, both the cube (square prism) and the triangular prism wi li repeat to form larger versions of themselves, and the triangular prism can also be placed to form hexagonal prisms. In summary, the five qualifying prisms give ri se to an infinite number of possible space filling permutations. This is consiqtent with the general nature of the prism · class of semiregular figures since there are an infinite number of finite prisms. The Archimedean polyhedra compose a finite class, and we find that their high symmetry limits the inventory of space filling possi bi lities. In order to set limits on the number of space filling prism systems, the requirement was established that ali vertices in the array must be congruent. Now, in the case of the finite set of eleven multi pie space filling systems which are composed of various combinations of the Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, ali vertices are congruent. Thus, ali of the space filling systems we have so far mentioned (which total 23 cases) consisting of regular and semiregular polyhedra, including the unary systems and the prism family, can be considered to be uniform structures since in each system ali vertices are equally surrounded by the same number of edges. This uniformity has important consequences for the reciproca! space filling arrangements (dual nets) of these 23 space filling systems .. *Andreini was lhe first to enumerate these.\n \n 5.1 O Space filling by combinations of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra.\n \n Dual Space Filling The concept of the dual network or recíproca! space fíllíng has been defíned ín Chapter 1. In revíew, ít ís formed by connectíng the centers of each polyhedron ín a space fíllíng array to ali neíghbors wíth whích ít shares a common face. lt follows from the defínítíon that íf ali vertíces ín a space fíllíng array are congruent (uníform), the dual network wíll forma unary space fíllíng system composed of a síngle kínd of polyhedron. Such a polyhedron has also been descríbed as a domaín of a vertex ín Chapter 1 (pp. 8-9). lf there ís more than one kínd of vertex ín a space fíllíng structure, íts dual space fíllíng wíll be composed of as many dífferent kínds of polyhedra as there are dífferent kínds of vertíces.\n \n a.

However, three of these original 23 uníform systems have dual space fíllíng systems whích are also comprísed of regular or semíregular polyhedra. Whíle the dual of a síngle cube ís an octahedron, the space fíllíng of cubes ís a self-dual and ís the only such case. n. TrirectangularDipyramid\n \n The triangular prísm and the hexagonal prísm space fíllíng systems are dual to each other. Therefore, only 20 new polyhedra are formed wíth the dual space fíllíng systems. Actually one of these ís already famílíar as the domaín of the dual network of the tetrahedral I octahedral system: namely the rhombíc dodecahedron, the only Archímedean dual polyhedron that wíll fíll space. lt ís both a fíníte dual polyhedron and the domaín of an ínfíníte dual space fíllíng system. Subtractíng the rhombíc dodecahedron then, there are stíll19 space fíllíng polyhedra whích have not been díscussed. These are í llustrated ín [5.11].

These space filling systems must be oriented to the triangular net. This explains the necessity of the orthorhombic prism, which is a replacement for the square prism (cube), in those space filling systems which conventionally incorporate triangular, hexagonal, and/or dodecagonal prisms in combination with the cube.\n \n Figure [ 6.5] shows closest packed spheres generating the truncated octahedron and a corresponding similarly oriented model showing the tetrahedral/ octahedral network of equi lateral triangles, which also generates the truncated octahedron. Figure [6.6] shows a similar set of spheres generating the truncated cuboctahedron.\n \n The fact that ali of these polyhedra can be classified in terms of closest packed spheres is remarkable, even granting that subtle metric problems remain. Ali of the symmetry properties of the polyhedra are preserved, except for the octagonal prism and dodecagonal prism, which here have lower symmetry than their semi regular counterparts. The closest packing of spheres serves to show the interrelatedness of the various systems. lt demonstrates an array of orderly permutations of a •simple overall system. Since ali the vertices of tetrahedra and octahedra in a space filling array correspond to centers of closest packed spheres, any of the vertices of the polyhedra classified in Table 6.1 can also be defined by the vertices in the tetrahedral/ octahedral space fi lling. Beca use of the usefulness of triangulated structures, this becomes a tantalizing bit of knowledge.\n \n b\n \n 6.6 A closest packing of spheres (a), and a tetrahedral/octahedral network, both ofwhich generate the truncated cuboctahedron (b).\n \n b\n \n 6.5 A clósest packing of spheres (a), anda tetrahedral/octahedral network, both of which generate the truncated octahedron (b).\n \n 59\n \n Spheres as Morphological Units\n \n In Table 6.1 only the minimum number of generating spheres has been given for each polyhedron. lt is possible, of course, to closest pack spheres to form any of these same polyhedra with large numbers of spheres along each edge. Fuller has shown this with his concentric sphere packing (Marks). For example, exactly twelve spheres will pack concentrically around a center sphere forming the vertices of the cuboctahedron (No. 5, Cubic System, Table 6.1; see also [1.3a]. Additional concentric layers of spheres may be indefinitely packed around this same nucleus resulting in larger and larger cuboctahedra [6.7]*\n \n The cuboctahedron is the only polyhedron of the regular and semiregular figures that can be formed from a concentric packing of spheres. This concentric structure also yields a modified cuboctahedron which is twisted 60° on one equatorial plane [6.8]. This configuration arises out of hexagonal closest packing, and defines a shape of less symmetry than the cuboctahedron defined by cubic closest packed spheres. lt is the triangular orthobicupola of [5.12]. 6.8 The triangular orthobicupola is a hexagonal closest packed structure.\n \n *Fuller has shown that the number of spheres on each successive layer is given by 1On 2 + 2, where n is the number of the layer (or the number of intervals between spheres on a given edge, as this will always correspond to the number of the layer). Fuller refers to this modular incrementation as the frequency of the system.\n \n Justas the rhombic dodecahedron is the domain of the cubic closest packing, the trapezorhombic dodecahedron is the domain of hexagonal closest packing. Other polyhedra can be built up in various ways-the tetrahedron, for example, grows by addition of additional layers of packed spheres to one face only. This isshown in [6.9]. That larger polyhedra can be built up from equal spheres means that tetrahedra and octahedra may also be accumulated to yield larger and larger polyhedra. The implications of this, when combi ned with the inherent triangulation of these systems, are examined !ater in the book. An appreciation of the packing properties of tetrahedra and octahedra is the basis of a spatial sensibility which enables optimum use of the principie of triangulation for architectural structures. The dual space filling systems are absent from Table 6.1. Ali of these systems can be classified according to the closest packing of spheres; however, this does not prove to be very convenient. For example, it takes a minimum of 93 spheres to form the vertices of the rhombic dodecahedron, and even at that, the rhombic faces are not well illu;:;trated. In general, the sphere packing system is cumbersome, if not altogether ineffective, for classifying the polyhedra of the dual nets. This is particularly true of the cubic system.\n \n 6. 7 Generating cuboctahed ra by the concentric closest packing of spheres (after Fuller).\n \n One Frequé.ncy\n \n 6.9 Enlarging the tetrahedron by adding layers of spheres to one face.\n \n Two Frequency\n \n Three Frequency\n \n 60\n \n Toward a Morphological System\n \n Although ou r concern has been the classification of those regular and semi regular polyhedra which are components of space filling systems, the icosahedron has some interesting properties in relation to sphere packing that should not go unnoticed. Fuller has pointed out that if the center sphere of a 13-sphere cuboctahedral array is allowed to \"shrink\" in diameter, the twelve outer spheres shift into a new contracted position to form the twelve vertices of the icosahedron. This constitutes the most symmetrical distribution of spheres closest packed around a common center point [6.10a].\n \n However, this system is not capable of repeating itself in concentric layers as is the cuboctahedron packing. Single shells of spheres can be formed with any arbitrarily large number of spheres along each edge of the icosahedron, but they cannot form concentric contiguous layers of spheres. lf ali spheres are equal, twenty planar triangular arrays are formed corresponding to the twenty triangular faces of the icosahedron [6.1 Ob,c].* *A variation of the equation that accounts for the number of spheres in the outer shell of the cuboctahedron also accounts for the number of spheres on the outer icosahedral shell. This may be written as 10(m-1) 2 + 2, where m is here the number of spheres along each edge of the icosahedron. This packing principie of the icosahedron is closely related to the structure of the Fui ler (1969a) geodesic domes and, as Horne and others have observed, to the structure of certain viruses (Horne 1963a; Horne and Wildy).\n \n 6.10 Twelve spheres packed around a point form the icosahedron (a); and twenty planar triangular arrays of spheres around a point form the 20 faces of the icosahedron shell (b, c).\n \n a\n \n b\n \n 61\n \n c\n \n Spheres as Morphological Units\n \n Limitations of Spheres as Morphological Units\n \n The sphere packing approach is quite an effective morphological accounting system, but it does have limitations. Although we know that the centers of spheres can be joined to form an equilateral triangular network, the sphere itself has no finite characteristic symmetry that can be related to the discrete geometric relationships and finite symmetries that ou r polyhedron exhibit lt has an infinite number of symmetry axes of infinite-fold rotational symmetry; it is simply toa symmetrical. In fact, as far as periodic arrangements in three-dimensional space are concerned, the sphere itself can be considered an amorphous (shapeless) element. The interconnections that join the sphere centers to define the edges of various polyhedra classified by sphere packings are after ali, only imaginary constructions. Even though their positions and direction are determined by the manner in which spheres must assoei ate in closest packing, there is still much interpreting to do.\n \n 6.11 The rhombic dodecahedron as a morphological unit: cubic closest packing.\n \n Tetrahedron Truncated Tetrahedron\n \n Rhombicuboctahedron\n \n Cube\n \n Octahedron\n \n Truncated Cube\n \n Tetragonal Prism\n \n Truncated Octahedron\n \n Cuboctahedron Truncated Cuboctahedron\n \n Octagonal Prism\n \n 6.12 The trapezorhom bic dodecahed ron as a morphological unit: hexagonal closest packing.\n \n I\n \n '\n \n ' '\n \n Triangular Prism (A)\n \n Triangular Prism (B)\n \n Hexagonal Prism (B)\n \n 62\n \n Toward a Morphological System\n \n Orthorhombic Prism\n \n Hexagonal Prism (A)\n \n Dodecagonal Prism\n \n Polyhedra as Morphological Units\n \n lf we are to have a morphological basis for modular structure, we must be able to account specifically for ali of the components-the interconnections as well as the vertices. Our morphological units in and of themselves must account for specific angular relationships, which the spheres do not provide in any direct way. We must find an at0mic or morphological unit which is defined inherently in terms of its relationships to the whole, so that its very shape predicts the manner of its association with other like forms. Because the rhombic dodecahedron is the doma in of the sphere in closest packed array, it may be considered as an alternative morphological unit. But, to cover ali cases arising from sphere packil')g, it must be paired with the trapezorhombic dodecahedron. Then, the first figure will serve as the morphological unit for structures based upon cubic closest packing; and the second (which is the dual of the triangular orthobicupola), for systems based upon hexagonal closest packing [6.11, 6.12]. With this we see that relatively subtle differances of geometric relationships, e.g., cubic vs. hexagonal closest packing, can be differentiated (perhaps even predicted) by the inherent limitations given by the shape of particular morphological units. The sites of the'fcc lattice correspond to the centers of spheres in cubic closest packing (see p. 40). Therefore, the rhombic dodecahedron is also the domain of the fcc lattice. Similarly, the truncated octahedron is the domain of the bcc l(l.ttice. We, have also seen that the dual riet of space filling truncated octahedra is the space filling of tetragonal disphenoids which forms a fully triangulated net with vertex coordination of fourteen. Remember that the crystallographic lattices are not concerned with the interconnections of points in space, but only with relative point locations defined in terms of symmetry. The tetragonal disphenoid array is formed when both nearest and next nearest neighbors are connected from each point in the bcc lattice, which explains how these structures are related.\n \n 63\n \n The truncated octahedron can also be considered a morphological unit. We have seen that twelve spheres (or rhombic dodecahedra) can be packed around a center sphere (or rhombic dodecahedron), forming the twelve vertices of the cuboctahedron. The truncated octahedron exhibits similar behavior. lf truncated octahedra are placed on the fourteen faces of a nuclear truncated octahedron, their centers form the fourteen vertices of the rhombic dodecahedron. Concentric layers may be added and each new layer reveals still a larger rhombic dodecahedron. * The rhombic dodecahedron is itself a dual space filling polyhedron. This suggests that truncated octahedron packings may be able to account, at least to some degree, for some of the other dual space filling polyhedra. A few dual space fillings can be accounted for by packings of truncated octahedra; however, the bulk of these polyhedra are difficult to organize with the truncated octahedron as the morphological unit. The regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and cube can also be formed by combining truncated octahedra; however, the truncated octahedron does not serve very well as an accounting system for the more complex figures. For example, it takes 80 truncated octahedra to define a single larger truncated octahedron, whereas it takes only 38 spheres to define the same figure. Space filling polyhedra are morphological units of more specific geometric content than spheres. For example, the rhombic dodecahedron and the trapezorhombic dodecahedron of themselves reveal the differences between cubic closest packing and hexagonal closest packing. The rhombic dodecahedron has fui I cubic symmetry, while the trapezorhombic dodecahedron has only one axis of 3-fold symmetry and three axes of 2-fold symmetry. The truncated octahedron also has fui I cubic symmetry; but its faces have no planes in common with the rhombic dodecahedron and, therefore, its packing arrangement is different. *The number of truncated octahedra on each layer is given by the equation 12n 2 + 2, where n is the number of the layer. The first layer has 14 truncated octahedra, the second has 50, the third has 11 O, etc. This equation was reported by J. W. Marvin (1939a).\n \n Polyhedra as Morphological Units\n \n Since, as morphological units, the rhombic dodecahedron and truncated octahedron can generate a variety of different polyhedra in the cubic system, perhaps a morphological unit could be derived which would combine the properties of both figures. Such a combination may provide a basis for a more integrative morpholog ical system. lf we are to pursue this line of thought, it will be necessary (at least temporarily) to abandon the hexagonal system, i.e., trapezorhombic dodecahedron packings. With the hexagonal system set aside, is it possible to develop a universal morphological system which can account for ali of the figures which comprise the various space filling polyhedra of the cubic system? The space filling nets of both the truncated octahedron and rhombic dodecahedron are fully triangulated. For the former, the dual net consists of congruent isosceles triang les, and for the latter, it consists of congruente qui lateral triangles. The fact that both of the polyhedra have cubic symmetry suggests that the dual nets might be related in some simple way to each other.\n \n To review the symmetry involved: cubic symmetry is that of three axes of 4-fold symmetry, four axes of 3-fold symmetry, and six axes of 2-fold symmetry. In the space filiing net of tetrahedra and octahedra, each vertex has a coordination of twelve corresponding to the twelve faces of the rhombic dodecahedron which forms the dual net. This rhombic dodecahedron is a domain in the sense that as the space filiing dual of the tetrahedral/ octahedral system, it accounts for the discrete geometrical and symmetrical arrangements which define the typical vertex. The edges of the network emanating from the center of the rhombic dodecahedron pass through the centers of each face andare perpendicular to the faces [6.13]. These edges are equivalent to the six axes of 2-fold rotational symmetry of the cube.\n \n The truncated octahedron is the domain of the tetragonal disphenoidal space filiing network. Each vertex in this structure isalikejoined byfourteenedges. When these fourteen edges emanate fromthe center of the truncated octahedron, six pass perpendicularly through the centers of the six square faces and eight pass perpendicularly through the centers of the eight hexagonal faces [ 6.14]. The six edges are directed along the three 4-fold axes of the cube and the eight edges are directed along the four 3-fold axes of the cube. 6.14 The truncated octahedron is the domain of the 14-connected tetragonal d isphenoid network.\n \n 6.13 The rhombic dodecahedron is the doma in of the 12-connected tetrahedral/octahedral network.\n \n Thus, there are three sets of planes which are perpendicular to the three sets of symmetry axes of the cube. These three sets are calied cube, octahedron, and dodecahedron planes. They are paraliel to the faces of the cube, octahedron, and rhombic dodecahedron, respectively [6.15]. The cleavage planes ofthe cu,bic closest packing of spheres correspond to these planes. lt is significant that for ali of the polyhedra of tetrahedral or cubic symmetry which com pose space filiing systems, the faces are paraliel to one or more of the three sets of cubic planes and this includes ali of the dual space filiers. The rhombic dodecahedron's faces are paraliel to only one set of planes, while the truncated octahedron has faces parailei to the cube planes, as weli as to the octahedron planes. Among the semiregular polyhedra, only the rhombicuboctahedron and the truncated cuboctahedron incorporate ali three planes. Neither of these polyhedra wili fi li space alone, and, therefore, it is impossible to forma space filiing morphological unit which combines ali three planes. 6.15 The cubic planes: cube (a), octahedron (b), and dodecahedron planes (c).\n \n c\n \n 64\n \n Toward a Morphological System\n \n Morphological Networks\n \n Abstraction and Built Form: The Morphological Node and Branches\n \n We have seen that the edges of the tetrahedral I octahedral network plus the tetragonal disphenoidal network include ali of the symmetry axes of the cube. Since we cannot represent these directions with a single space filling morphological unit, perhaps a more versatile and visceral morphological scheme could be derived by way of a morpho/ogica/ network. lt may be possible to form a network which can incorporate ali three types of cubic axes in one system, perhaps a universal cubic network in which the elements of1 position and direction can be concretized as bui lt form. lf we consider ali of the thirteen symmetry axes of the cube passing through the center of the cube, a vertex is formed in which 26 edges meet [6.16]. Of the 26 edges originating from this vertex, six are directed toward the centers of the cube faces, eight are directed toward the corners of the cube, and twelve are directed toward the midpoints of the edges. The same 26 directions may be derived from the octahedron because of its duality with the cube. lf the 26 edges originate from the center of the octahedron, six are directed toward the vertices, eight are directed toward the faces, and, as in the cube, twelve are directed toward the midpoints ofthe edges [6.17].\n \n 6.16 Twenty-six edges originating from the center ofthe cube (symmetry axes of the cube). 6.17 Twenty-six edges originating from the center of the octahed ron (symmetry axes of cube = symmetry axes of octahedron).\n \n 8oth the rhombicuboctahedron and the truncated cuboctahedron have 26 faces which are perpendicular to the directions of the aforementioned 26 edges. When the edges originate from the center of either of these polyhedra they are directed towards the centers of each face. These are the only semiregular polyhedra in which this is true. These two polyhedra are the only ones which incorporate ali three sets of cubic planes; it is not surprising, then, that they have this relationship to the 26 edges. We may consider either of these polyhedra to be the domain of a 26-connected network; however, we have already noted that neither of these polyhedra can fi li space alone. This suggests that it is not possible to form a uniform network in which every node is equally joined by 26 edges. lt will be shown Iater that for every 26-connected vertex, exactly three 6-connected vertices are required.\n \n 65\n \n Abstraction and Built Form\n \n The concept of symmetry axes is relatively abstract. In the rest of this chapter I will expand on the concretization of this concept, so as to reduce the abstraction of symmetry to catalogable, buildable form. The notions of \"vertex\" and \"edge\" are also abstract, although to a lesser degree than that of symmetry axes. lt is easy enough to visualize hard spheres or polyhedra as physical units or modules. The idea of vertex and edge needs to be given in a similarly concrete form. lf we are to define vertices and edges in terms of specific physical form, we must find edge and vertex morphological units that embody the appropriate geometry and symmetry. We have seen that the doma in of the 26connected vertex is either the rhombicuboctahedron or the truncated cuboctahedron. Perhaps one of these could be viewed as a vertex with a set of complementary edges with cross-sectional shapes that would match faces on the polyhedral domain. At this point, it will be useful to adopt some new terminology. Vertices, actually built as specific physical entities, shall be designated as nades, and built physical edges shall be called branches.\n \n A framework consisting of 26 cubes placed around a central cube can be used to generate a rhombicuboctahedron of proportions particularly well suited for use as our morphological nade. Figure [6.18a] shows such an array of cubes in which the octahedron planes are placed in the eight corner cubes. Dodecahedron planes are placed in the twelve cubes which li e between pairs of corner cubes, and the six cubes at the centers of each side contain simple cube planes. Thus the rhombicuboctahedron is bounded by six square faces, eight triangular faces, and twelve rectangular faces. Because of the rectangular faces it does not strictly qualify as a semiregular polyhedron, but the individual faces and the rotation axes to which they are perpendicular have the same n-fold rotational symmetries. That is, the rectangular faces have 2-fold rotational symmetry and they are perpendicular to the six axes of 2-fold symmetry; the triangular faces have 3-fold rotational symmetry and are perpendicular to the four axes of 3-fold symmetry, and the square faces with 4-fold symmetry are . perpendicular to the three axesof 4-fold symmetry.\n \n The specially proportioned rhombicuboctahedron is then the ideal form for our morphological node. * lts square, triangular, and rectangular faces serve to identify the character of the morphological branches that must meet at this node. Secause there are three sets of symmetry axes there must be three different branches. The rhombicuboctahedron accounts for these three branches with its three faces and dictates that the branches have cross-sectional shapes which correspond in symmetry to the axes they represent. Therefore, the branches will have rectangular, triangular and square cross sections corresponding to 2-, 3-, and 4-fold symmetry axes respectively [6.18b]. A most interesting fact may now be noted. The branch of triangular cross-section must be twisted along its symmetry axis exactly 60° so that when two rhombicuboctahedral morphological nades are joined by a 3-fold branch they are properly oriented to each other. lf a nontwisted 3-fold branch is used the nades become cubically disoriented. Here we have a manifestation of a subtle and fundamental difference between cubic symmetry and hexagonal symmetry. With the nontwisted branch it is possible, in combination with the twisted triangular branch, to build certain hexagonal structures.\n \n The Physical Model System\n \n In orderto facilitate the empirical exploration and assembly of various modular networks, I have developed a model system. lt is based on the foregoing morphological node and is shown in [6.19].* The model system consists of a molded plasc tic node and extruded plastic brancrres. The node is our specially proportioned rhombicuboctahedron with 26 spokes emanating from its faces: six square spokes, eight triangular spokes, and twelve rectangular spokes. There is a set of three branch types corresponding in cross-sectional shape to the spokes on the node. The branches are hollow and are designed so they will just friction-fit around the proper spoke. The node, including its spokes, of [6.19] is 1.25 inches in diameter. *This system is protected by U.S. Patent 3600825 \"Synthesized Natural Geometric Structures\" and six additional patents in Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, ltaly, and Japan.\n \n *Aithough the truncated cuboctahedron has 26 faces, ali of these faces do not reflect the symmetry of the rotation axes to which they are normal. For example, it has hexagonal faces perpendicular to the 3-fold octahedral axis and octagon faces perpendicular to the 4fold axes.\n \n 6.19 Morphological nade connectors and branches.\n \n a\n \n b 6.18 Cubic planes generate rhombicuboctahedral envelope of morphological nade (a); cross sections of morphological branches having 4-, 2-, and 3-fold symmetry (b).\n \n 66\n \n Toward a Morphological System\n \n Since the spokes on the node and the branches are shaped accordi ng to the symmetry of the rotation axes they represent, when networks are assembled, no matter how randomly, the nodes always remain properly oriented with respect to one another. In orderto achieve the twist in the threefold branch mentioned above, it is necessary to provi de a three-fold splice which incorporates the 60° twist. When two short lengths are joined to each end of the splice, a properly twisted 3-fold branch results. This twist can also be an integral part of aone-piece molded branch. · This physical model system embodies principies of symmetrywhich govern · modular order in three-dimensional space, and it makes such principies accessible to direct sensory experience. This system is a sophisticated \"Tinker Toy\" with which we can study modular systems as physicogeometrical constructions rather than analytical, algebraic abstractions.\n \n The Universal Network and the Universal Node System\n \n I have already hinted at the possibility of a universal cubic network (p. 65). We now move toward the realization of that ideal with the just-described universal cubic node. In the interest of brevity I shall reter to this as the Universal Node.®* The Universal Node connector, with its 26 spokes, has fui I cubic symmetry. Figure [6.20] shows three views of the node along each of the symmetry axes. In order to fully realize a universal cubic network it is necessary to establish not only the characteristic node and the cross sections of the corresponding branches but the relative !engths of the branches as well. *The term Universal Nade is a registered trade mark of Synestructics, Inc.\n \n A convenient notation for identifying the three branches can be borrowed from crystallography in which points, vector directions and crystal planes are established in terms of an x, y, z (rectangular) coordinate system. Set eight cubes as octants surrounding the origin x = y = z = O of a coordinate system. Because only signs change in the various octants of the coordinate system, and not the distances to corresponding points, it is only necessary to consider the octant in which ali the values are positive, i.e., the upper right top quadrant. The coordinates are those of the point toward which a given vector is directed from the origin. The cube edges emanating from the origin (the lower left rear corner of the cube) have the following coordinates: x = +1, y =O, z =O; x = O, y = + 1, z = O; and x = O, y = O, z = + 1 [6.21a]. The coordinates of these points may be abbreviated as 100, 01 O, 001, keeping in mind that the numbers are always in x,y,z order. The direction indices or the vector directions to these points (i.e., the set of three vector components that wi li carry one from the origin to the points) are enclosed in square brackets: [1 00], [01 O], [001]. The Miller indices of any plane have the coordinates of the direction to which the plane is perpendicular. To distinguish thern from vector directions, the Miller índices of a plane are placed in curved brackets. The planes (faces) perpendicular to the [100], [010], and [110] directionswould be indicated as: (1 00), (01 0), and (001 ).\n \n 6.20 Symmetry axes of the Universal Nade connector.\n \n 3-fold axis\n \n 2-fold axis\n \n 4-fold axis\n \n 6.21 Various points x, y, z on the cube in the first octant of a rectangular coordinate system. The direction indices of these points are denoted by [x y z]. Shown are the cube edges (a), face diagonais (b), and body diagonal (c).\n \n z\n \n z\n \n z\n \n origin\n \n a\n \n 67\n \n X\n \n Abstraction and Built Forrn\n \n b\n \n X\n \n c\n \n X\n \n The direction índices of the octant face diagonais starting from the originare [110], [101], and [011] (see [6.21b]). There is only one body diagonal emanating from the origin into the first octant; its direction índices are [111] (see [6.21 c]). Only the signs change when we write the direction índices for the edge, face and body directions for the other octants. When ali of the sign combinations and permutations are combined with ali possible triplets of O and 1, ali 26 directions of the Universal Node connector will have been accounted for. Because, up to sign changes, there are only three unique sets of coordinate combinations, we may reter to each set simply as the [100], [110], and [111] directions. We wi li henceforth designate ou r three branches accordingly: cube edge direction, [100] branch; cube face diagonal direction [110] branch; and cube body diagonal direction, .[ 111] branch.\n \n When they are in their proper dual relationship, the nodes of the rhombic dodecahedral array fali at the centers of every tetrahedron and octahedron with the nades of the tetrahedral/octahedral array at the centers of the rhombic dodecahedra. These nodes may be connected to each other in sue h a way that a superimposition of tetrahed ral/ octahed rai and tetragonal disphenoidal arrays are formed. This gives rise to a network consisting of both 26- and 14-connected nades and the inadvertent appearance of 4-connected nades where [ 100] and [ 11 O] branches cross each other. A model ofthis network is seen in [6.22]. The model is seen to be in the form of a truncated octahedron.\n \n The edge length ratios of the branches are obtained by means of the Pythagorean theorem. lf the cube edge is A units long, then the face diagonal is AV2 units long, and the body diagonal AV3 units. We will see that various multiples of these ratios account for ali of the edges that appear in the space fi lling inventory of the cubic system in Table 5.1. lt is important to note, however, that these are ratios of the distance between nodal centers and not to the actual lengths of the branches, which, dueto the necessary bulk of the nodes, will be somewhat shorter depending on the radii of the nades.\n \n 6.22 Tetrahedral/octahedral and tetragonal disphenoid arrays combine to forma network of 26/14/4-connected nodes. 6.23 The universal network. Note the 26- and 6-connected nades here and in the following figure.\n \n We can now proceed to the development of a universal network that combines the tetrahedral/octahedral space filling net with the tetragonal disphenoidal space filling net. The tetragonal disphenoidal network can be derived from the tetrahedral/octahedral network and vice versa. In this respect, it is useful to consider the relationship of the tetrahedral/ octahedral network (composed of [110] branches) superimposed on its dual rhombic dodecahedral network (composed of [ 111] branches).\n \n 68\n \n The 26-connected nades are formed at the 12-connected nodes of the tetrahedral/octahedral array where the 14 add itional branches o f the tetragonal d isphenoid network meet. The additional 14-connected nades of the 26-, 14-, and 4-connected network are at the centers of the rhombic dodecahedra. We may açjd 12 more [110] branchestothese 14connected nodes so that they are also 26-connected. When this is done the 4-connected nades become 6-connected as the new [ 11 O] branches cross the intersection ofthe original [100] and [110] branches. lt is impossible to forma network consisting entirely of 26-connected nodes. For every 26-connected nade, there must be three 6-connected nodes. This network is shown in [6.23] and [6.24]. The important thing is that both the 4- and 6-connected nodes are subsets of the Universal Node. In the forme r, the branches are attached to two spokes in the appropriate [ 100] directions and two spokes in the appropriate [ 11 O] directions [6.25], while in the latter, the branches are still attached to two spokes in the [100] directions but now have four [110] directions [6.26].\n \n Toward a Morphological System\n \n 6.24 Detail of the universal network. 6.25 Four-connected subset of Universal Node connectorwith two [110] and two [100] branches. 6.26 Six-connected subset of Universal Node connector with four [11 O] and two [1 00] branches.\n \n We see from this construction that the respective typical nodes of the tetrahedral/ octahedral [6.27] and tetragonal disphenoidal [6.28] systems are also subsets of the Universal Node connector. Further examination shows that the characteristic vertices of ali of the polyhedral space filling systems consisting of regular and semiregular polyhedra of the cubic system are subsets of the Universal Node. The vertices of ali the individual polyhedra which com pose these space filling systems maytherefore also be considered subsets of the Universal Node connector. Ali of the edges of these space filling nets or individual polyhedra are various combinations of [ 100] and [ 11 O] branches. What is even more remarkable is that a// of the space filling nets which are dual to the systems composed of regular and semiregular polyhedra may be assembled from Universal Node connectors and various combinations of [100], [ 11 O], and [ 111] branches. Note that [ 111] branches on ly appear in the dual nets. The network consisting of 26- and 6-connectednodes[a23]and[a24]canbe considered to be the universal cubic network in which ali of the cubic space filling systems and their dual nets exist simultaneously in a single construct. Any given space filling network is then a subset of this universal network. The interrelatedness of ali these systems is manifested in a minimum inventory of morphological component types which can be assembled into a vast array of diverse structures. Not only do the various plane faced polyhedral systems appear as subsets of the universal network, but a very large class of uniform and semiuniform* periodic networks not composed of plane faced polyhedra are also included.\n \n When ali of the nodes of the universal network are considered as an array of points, the sites of the primitive cubic lattice are defined. When only the 26-connected nodes are considered as an array of points, the sites of the bcc lattice are defined. Remember that the nodal positions of the tetragonal disphenoid net also define a bcc lattice. When only the 6-connected nodes are considered, a structure is formed in which the nodal position coincides with the vertices of the 4-connected net of [ 5.18a] defining % of the sites of the primitive cubic lattice. The minimum repeatable unit of the universal network is shown in [6.29]. By a cyclic rotation in 90° increments on each of the [ 100] branches of this repeat unit, the universal net is formed. Repetition clearly reveals the unit to be the source of the ratio of three 6-connected nodes to one 26-connected node, since there are six 6-connected and two 26-connected nodes. 6/2 = 3/1. The concepts of the Universal Node and universal network provi de the basis for an integrative morphological system. This system allows us to organize known three-dimensional structures in concrete physical terms, by way of models. As we shall see, it is also a powerful means for the discovery and classification of new systems of modular order in threedimensional physicogeometric space.\n \n *To review, uriform refers to infinite periodic networks in which ali nodes are of one kind (congruent). Semiuniform refers to infinite periodic networks which have infinite sets of congruent nodes of more than one type.\n \n 6.29 The minimum repeatable unit of the universal network.\n \n 6.27 Twelve-connected subset of Universal Node connector with all12 [110] branches. 6.28 Fourteen-connected subset of Universal Node connector with ali 6 [100] branches and ali eight [111] branches.\n \n 69\n \n Abstraction and Bui lt Form\n \n 7\n \n Classifying Finite Polyhedra with the lntegrative Morphological System\n \n Principies of Order and the Universal No de System\n \n 7.1\n \n 7.7\n \n Both the finite polyhedra and the space filling networks can be generated and classified by means of ou r integrative morphological system. As has already been said, the regular and semiregular polyhedra which were generated by the cubic closest packing of spheres (Table 6.1) are finite subsets of the universal net. Table 7.1 lists these ten polyhedra and provides recipes for their assembly from the kit of parts which is the Universal Node system. Such \"recipes\" are perfectly consistent with ou r interest in dealing with modular structures in terms of physical relationships among components. We can give a structural recipe for each of these polyhedra by giving the morphological features characteristic of each node. The characteristic Universal Node subset can be given in terrns of the direction indices of the occupied nodal spokes. This is identified in Table 7.1 as the \"Branch Directions at Node.\" In this column is indicated how many spokes are occupied in .a given direction and the total number of occupied spokes (\"Overall Coordination\"). '\n \n 7.3\n \n Because the physical design of the Universal Node and its associated branches embodies the principjes of symmetry which govern the combinatorial possibilities within a large class of periodic structures, a deep-rooted empirical understanding of complex relationships evolves with its use. Because the crosssectional shapes of the branches correspond to the shapes of their respective spokes on the Universal Node connector, and because these both reflect axes of symmetry, it is impossible to assemble any periodic array in which the Node is incorrectly oriented. By simply taking note of typical vertices, it is possible to \"blindly\" assemble from nodes and branches the whole of a finite, ora representative sample of an infinite, space filling system. This capability reflects the holistic character of the Universal Node and the universal network. The Universal Node and the universal network are completely interdependent. One cannot exist without the other and they define each other. Although the principies of symmetry embodied in the Universal Node connector can be expressed in terms of a cube or octahedron, the coordinated branch ratios and their multiples are defined by the periodic association of nodes. An individual cube, for example, is only a subset of the universal net and is a periodic (modular) association of nodes.\n \n 70\n \n @ '\n \n 7.4\n \n 7.6\n \n 7.10\n \n 7.12\n \n 7. 1-7.12 Regular and semi regular polyhedra assembled with the Universal Node System. Tetrahedron (7. 1); cube (7.2); octahedron (7.3); truncated tetrahedron (7.4); cuboctahedron (7.5); truncated octahedron (7.6); truncated cube (7. 7); rhombicuboctahedron (7.8); truncated cuboctahedron (7.9); octagonal prism (7. 1O); triangular prism (7. 11 ); hexagonal prism (7.12).\n \n The next column gives the total number of nodes for each complete polyhedron. In the next column the numbers and kinds of branches are given and the relative distances between nodes along each branch, i.e., the edge lengths between node centers are given. The total number of branches for a given polyhedron is equal to the total number of nodes multiplied by the overall coordination divided by two. Next, the inventory and description of the polygonal faces of each polyhedron are given. This includes the total number of faces, the number of each type of face, the kind of face, its symmetry, and the included angles of the face. Also, the face plane directions (Miller indices) are given. They are important in the construction of the dual space filling nets, as they predict the directions of the component branches of the constituent polyhedra. lt can be seen from Table 7.1 that ali but two of the cubic polyhedra have faces in the [111] direction, yet there are no cubic polyhedra in this table with [111] branches.\n \n In the last column is shown relative volumes of the polyhedra when the volume of the tetrahedron is taken as unity. Note that ali of the polyhedra have volumes which are whole-integer multi pies of the tetrahedron. This occurs because the universal network provides a modular dimensional correlation among these diverse polyhedra. Two polyhedra in the hexagonal systemthe triangular prism and hexagonal prism-are also identified in Table 7.1. Photographs of assembled models of these polyhedra are shown in [7. 1][7. 12]. We have now classified the finite polyhedra by means of our integrative morphological system. We now turn to a consideration of infinite periodic systems by returning to the various space filling systems we have identified in Table 5.1.\n \n Classifying Space Filling Systems with the lntegrative Morphological System\n \n Recai I that in our morphological system each vertex of any given space filling system is a subset of the Universal Node. The network of every space filling system will have its dual space filling system or network. There will be a different kind of polyhedron in the dual system for each different kind of vertex in the original system. A space filling system with vertices ali of one kind gives rise to a dual space filling arrangement composed of only one kind of polyhedron. A system composed of two kinds of vertices will give ri se to a dual space filling composed of two kinds of polyhedra, etc. Ali of the space filling systems composed of regular and semiregular polyhedra (Table 5.1) have vertices of one kind, so they will each have dual networks composed of a single type-but in general, a different type for each-of space filling polyhedron. Only those dual space filling systems that are dual to unary systems will themselves have vertices of a single type. For example, the cubic array is a self dual, and the truncated octahedral array has as its dual the array of tetragonal disphenoids. These are the only dual space filling systems that have ali vertices of a single type among the plane faced polyhedra. The binary, etc., space filling systems of Table 5.1 have vertices of one type; but, because they are composed of more than one kind of polyhedron, they give rise to dual nets composed of as many kinds of vertices as there are different polyhedra within the systems. For example, the tetrahedral/octahedral array has one kind of vertex but is binary. lt therefore has a single polyhedron as its space filling dual; but the latter-the rhombic dodecahedron-haq two kinds of vertices. The space filling of rhombicuboctahedron/ octagonal prism/truncated cube/cube has one kind of polyhedron in its dual net but four different kinds of vertices, one for each polyhedron of the parent system.\n \n 71\n \n Classifying Space Filling Systems\n \n Nodal Polyhedra\n \n Space filling systems that are dual to one another form the polyhedral domains of each other's vertices. A given polyhedron in a unary or multi pie space filling system will always define a vertex of its dual space filling network. The polyhedral domain will have the same number of faces as there are edges emanating from the vertex it surrounds. The edges will usually be perpendicular to the faces and will pass through face centers. As it encloses a vertex such a polyhedral domain will define a subset of the Universal Node, and may, therefore, be called a nodal po!yhedron. These nodal polyhedra are figures which characterize the coordination of the Universal Node or any of its subsets. Here again, coordination refers to the number of branches or struts that meet at a node. For example, the nodal polyhedron of the simple cubic net is a cube-one square face for each of its six [1 00] branches. The nodal polyhedron for the truncated octahedron net is the tetragonal disphenoid with one isosceles triangular face for each of the four [11 O] branches. Or, to look at the same structure the other way round, the truncated octahedron is the nodal polyhedron for the 14-connected tetragonal disphenoid net. In this case, the Universal Node has six [1 00] branches and eight [111] branches; these correspond to the six square and eight hexagonal faces of the truncated octahedron, respectively. The nodal polyhedron o f the 12-connected tetrahedral/octahedral (fcc) net is the rhombic dodecahedron. The rhombic dodecahedral net, however, requires two nodal polyhedra, one for each of its two kinds of nodal subsets.

Table 7.2 lists the fourteen cubic space filling systems and the nodal polyhedra that define their vertices. Thistable, likeTable 7.1, provides the recipes for the physical assembly of various modular structures. The face plane directions for each nodal polyhedron are identical to the branch directions of the node of the corresponding space filling system.\n \n The Universal Node provides six combinations of two branches which define altogether fourteen possible branch angles of less than 180°. Not ali the combinations are needed in the cubic space filling systems but they will ali eventually come into play as we explore the many modul.ar options provided by the Universal Node. In [7.13] are shown tive sections through the Universal Node connector taken normal to the various symmetry axes. Note that the section in the center is normal to a [112] axis. This axis does not appear in the Universal Node; it is not an axis of rotational symmetry, even though such symmetry is suggested by the sectional view. At the bottom of [7.13] is a list showing the fourteen possible branch ; angles of the six possible combinations oi spokes. lt is only coincidental that there are fourteen angles and fourteen space filling structures, or for that matter, the fourteen faces of the truncated octahedron. As we shall see, this particular set of fourteen angles gives to the Universal Node its extraordinary modularconfiguration capability.\n \n The faces of each nodal polyhedron are characterized by giving the number of each kind of face, the polygonal type, the symmetry, and the face angles. Both the directions and lengths are given for the branches that circumscribe each face, and, finally, the total number of branches for the entire polyhedron.\n \n Photographs of models of the space filling systems described in Table 7.2 and their nodal polyhedra are given in [7.14 ]-[7.27]. From the figures it can be seen that many of the dual space filling systems described by the nodal polyhedra have identical nets. The same net is associated, with different nodal polyhedra by virtue of the various ways in which polygonal circuits may be spanned. An example of this is given by nodal polyhedra of Nos. 5 and 6 of Table 7.2. The former is a square pyramid and the latter is the tetragonal octahedron which is exactly two of the square pyramids put together. They are both associated with the same net, but must be considered distinct space fillers.\n \n Note that although only [1 00], [11 0], and [111] branches appear, each branch needs to be provided in full and half lengths. Also, while [111] branches do not occur among the regular and semiregular polyhedra, they do appear quite frequently as edges of the nodal polyhedra. As a matter of fact, only the cube and octagonal prism do not have faces in the [111] directions.\n \n 7.13 The fourteen possible branch angles of less than 180° of the Universal Node connector: [

Hexagonal Space Filling Systems as Subsets of the Universal Network\n \n Because these five dual nets of the hexagonal system's prism space fillers involve planar combinations of 30°, 60°, 120°, and 90° in single polygons, they cannot be fit into the Universal Node system [ 4.8]. This reflects the most interesting fact that it is not possible to define a two-dimensional universal network. The reason for this is that there is no unique necessary planar relationship between the equilateral triangle and the square. We have seen that in three-dimensional space this relationship is trivial, as the Universal Node ably demonstrates. There is a fundamental integrative simplicity to periodic structures in three-dimensional space which is not equaled in two dimensions. Can the assumption that is frequently made about the relative simplicity of two-dimensional space be faulty? To the extent that a universal network in two dimensions is not really possible, the correlative aspects of two-dimensional space are far less elegant than the relationships demonstrated in three-dimensional space by the universal network.\n \n A most remarkable and unexpected discovery is that four of the hexagonal space filling configurations are subsets of the universal cubic net! These are the triangular prism, hexagonal prism, and the two different multi pie systems of triangular and hexagonal prisms (Table 5.1, Nos. 3, 4, 11, 12). Thetriangularand hexagonal prisms are dual to each other. The dual nets of the two forms of the triangular prism/hexagonal prism binary space filling systems can also be accounted for by the Universal Node system. This means that altogether only five of the twenty-three space filling systems we have inventoried in Table 5.1 cannot be accounted for as simple subsets of the universal net. However, the topological equivalents* of these five remaining space filling systems may be formed as subsets of the universal net. These are the packings of triangular prisms and cubes (2 cases); triangular and dodecagonal prisms; triangular prisms, cubes, and hexagonal prisms; and hexagonal prisr)ls, cubes, and dodecagonal prisms (Table 5.1, Nos. 13-15, 21, 22).\n \n 7.28 Topological equivalents of 5 space filling prism combinations of the hexagonal system as subsets of the universal network, shown in plan.\n \n Figure [7.28] shows in plan how this is possible. The cubes become rhombic prisms and the dodecagons become large hexagons with six additional nades at the midpoints of their edges. Ali of these but one (hex prism/rhombic prism/dodecagon prism) form uniform nets. However, it is not possible to form any of the dual nets of these five systems with the Universal Node kit of parts. *Networks (or polyhedra) may be considered topologically equivalent so long as their nades have the same characteristic coordination and the spatial distribution and inventory of their branches (and polygons) are the same, regardless of whether linear dimensions and angular relationships are the same. For example a simpie cube is topologically equivalent to any parallelipiped, and likewise a simple cubic network is topologically equivalent to any network describing a space filling array of parallelepipeds.\n \n 80\n \n Principies of Order\n \n Table 7.3 shows the nine hexagonal space til Iing prism systems; it is in a form identical to that of Table 7.2, except that nodal polyhedra are not given. Figures [7.29]-[7.37] show models of these systems. 7.29-7.37 Hexagonal space filling systems built according to the recipes ofTable 7.3.\n \n Another discovery is that although the hexagonal packing of tetrahedra and octahedra cannot be formed with the Universal Node connector, its dual net of trapezorhombic dodecahedra can by introducing a non-twisted [111] branch as an additional component. Because of this it cannot be formed as a subset of the universal net, but by use of nontwisted [111] branches in combinations with twisted [111] branches it is possible to assemble this configuration [7.38]. We have seen that it is possible to assemble with the Universal Node kit of parts topologically equivalent versions of certain prism systems in the hexagonal family.\n \n 7.38 The network of space filling trapezorhombic dodecahedra\n \n 7.32\n \n 7.37\n \n 81\n \n Classifying Space Filling Systems\n \n Table 7.3 Hexagonal Space Filling Systems\n \n Space Filling Systems\n \n ~~~~~~ Ratio\n \n Branch Directions _B_:ra::_n..:.c__ h_A::_ng:::..l_es.:..___at_N_:o:..:d..:.e_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ Z [1 00] [11 O] [111] [1 00]-[1 00] [11 0]-[11 O] [111]-[111] [1 00]-[11 O] [11 0]-[111] [1 00]-[111]\n \n 8\n \n 6\n \n 2\n \n 5\n \n 3\n \n 2\n \n 2\n \n 6\n \n 4\n \n 2\n \n 60°, 120°\n \n 90o\n \n 8\n \n 7\n \n 5\n \n 2\n \n 60°, 120°\n \n 90o\n \n 2\n \n 7\n \n 5\n \n 2\n \n 60°, 120°\n \n 90o\n \n 2\n \n 7\n \n 5\n \n 2\n \n 60°, 120°\n \n 90o\n \n 2\n \n 5\n \n 3\n \n 2\n \n 60°, 120°, 180°\n \n 90o\n \n 6\n \n 4\n \n 2\n \n 60°, 120°\n \n 90o\n \n 5\n \n 3\n \n 2\n \n 60°, 120°, 180°, 120°\n \n 90o, 90o\n \n 1 Triangular prism [7.29]\n \n 2\n \n Hexagonal prism [7.30]\n \n 3\n \n Triangular prism Hexagonal prism [7.31]\n \n 4\n \n Triangular prism Hexagonal prism [7.32]\n \n 5\n \n Triangular prism Rhombic prism (cube) [7.33]\n \n 6\n \n Triangular prism Rhombic prism (cube) [7.34]\n \n 7\n \n Triangular prism 12-prism [7.35]\n \n 8\n \n 9\n \n Hexagonal prism Triangular prism\n \n 2\n \n Rhombic prism [7.36]\n \n 3\n \n Hexagonal prism\n \n 2\n \n 12-prism\n \n 1\n \n Rhombic prism [7.37]\n \n 3\n \n 82\n \n Principies of Order\n \n Table 7.4 Dodecahedral Space Filling Systems\n \n Space Filling System\n \n Space Filling Ratio\n \n z [100]\n \n [110] [111] [100]-[100] [110]-[110] [111]-[111] [100]-[110] [110]-[111] [100]-[111]\n \n 4\n \n 4\n \n [7.40]\n \n 5 1\n \n 4\n \n Trapezorhombic dodecahedron\n \n 4\n \n 4\n \n 8\n \n 8\n \n 1 Elongated dodecahedron\n \n 2\n \n Branch Directions Branch Angles at Node\n \n [7.38]\n \n 3\n \n 4\n \n Octahedrally truncated rhombic dodecahedron Tetrahedron\n \n 8\n \n 8\n \n 144°44'\n \n 60°\n \n 3\n \n 70°32'\n \n 2\n \n [7.41]\n \n 4\n \n Cubically truncated rhombic dodecahedron\n \n 90o\n \n 4 3\n \n 125°1 fi 109°28'\n \n 4\n \n 4\n \n Cube\n \n [7.42]\n \n 5 Cubocta-\n \n 90o\n \n 4 3\n \n hedrally truncated rhombic dodecahedron\n \n 4\n \n 3\n \n 6\n \n 4\n \n 125°1 fi 144°44'\n \n 60°\n \n Cube Tetrahedron\n \n 2\n \n 6 Truncated rhombicuboctahedron\n \n 2\n \n 60°\n \n 2\n \n 90o\n \n 6\n \n 4\n \n 4\n \n 3\n \n 60°, 120°\n \n 4 1\n \n 2\n \n 60°\n \n 109°28'\n \n 90o\n \n 70°32'\n \n 90o\n \n Cuboctahedron 1 Octahedron\n \n 2\n \n Triangular prism\n \n 8\n \n 7 Truncated rhombicuboctahedron Truncated cube Truncated tetrahedron\n \n 2\n \n Triangular prism\n \n 8\n \n 83\n \n Classifying Space Filling Systems\n \n 90°, 144°44' 135°\n \n 90o\n \n 125°16'\n \n lt is also possible to assemble a topological equivalent in the hexagonal system of the tetrahedral/octahedral net. This is shown in [7.39]. lt is achieved by the use of [11 O] and [ 100] branches. At each node, nine [11 O] branches and three [1 00] branches meet to forma uniform structure. In this configuration every other layer is collapsed by 50%, with regular octahedra stacked vertically on collapsed octahedra having the symmetry of the hexagonal prism.\n \n Dodecahedral Space Filling Systems\n \n There are four more space filling systems that are, along with their duais, subsets of the universal net. These are the elongated dodecahedron and the three truncated versions of the rhombic dodecahedron which combine with cubes and/or tetrahedra to fill ali space (see Chapter 5 [5.15]). The recipes for these systems along with the trapezorhombic dodecahedral system are given in the usual form in Table 7.4. Nodal polyhedra are not given in the table; they may be easily constructed. The elongated dodecahedral and two of the three truncated rhombic dodecahedral systems are shown in [7.40]-[7.42]. The two truncated rhombicuboctahedral systems described in Chapter 5 (p. 49) are also included in Table 7.4 (Nos. 6, 7), but are not illustrated here.\n \n 7.39 Topological equivalenl in lhe hexagonal syslem of lhe lelrahedral/oclahedral network.\n \n 7.40 Network of space filling elongaled dodecahedron (see Table 7.4). 7.41 Network of space filling lruncaled rhombic dodecahedra/lelrahedra (see Table 7.4).\n \n 84\n \n Principies of Order\n \n We have discovered that Universal Node imposes an inherent arder. Every new structure assembled with this integrative morphological system is instantly understood and may be classified in terms of its relation to the whole. The Universal Node itself allows us to anticipate and then to build a diverse array of alternative modular configurations, in which the notion of subsets of the whole emerges as an ordering principie.\n \n 7.42 Network of space filling lruncaled dodecahedra/cubes (see Table 7.4).\n \n Triangulated Structures Derived from the Universal Network\n \n In our inventory of periodic structures based on the universal network, we have seen very few triangulated systems, particularly those in which a minimum deviation in branch lengths is exhibited.* We are familiar with the tetrahedron/octahedron system [7.16a] (which is composed of equilateral triangles) and the space filling of tetragonal disphenoids that forms the 14-connected bcc network [7.15b]. The bcc network is composed of two branch lengths ([100] and [111 ]) which vary in length by only 15%. The space filling tetragonal octahedron [7.19b] is composed of the same two branches and forms a triangular network with 8c and 14-connected nades. There are some other triangulated systems among the dual nets (nodal polyhedra) of Table 7.2, but their edge-length ratios deviate considerably (by approximately 39%) from the equilateral ideal. In spite of this, .any of these networks might serve as useful structures in certain appl ications. *Triangulated structures tend to be more energyefficient when differences in branch lengths are minimized. See the Law of Closest Packing and Triangulation in Chapter 1.\n \n 85\n \n There are two other efficient periodic triangulated systems which can be considered subsets of the universal net and which relate to lhe tetragonal disphenoid and tetragonal octahedron. They are based upon two dual nets from the space filling of regular and semiregular polyhedra (Table 7.2)-namely, the space filling of rhombic dodecahedra [7.16b] and rhombic hexahedra [7.17b]. Both of these systems are composed of the same rhombic face, which is formed by four [111] branches. This rhombic face may be easily subdivided into two isosceles triangles by placing a [100] branch across its short diagonal. The triangles, like those of the tetragonal disphenoid and tetragonal octahedron, are formed with branches that differ in length by only 15%, and therefore constitute an efficient basis for triangulated systems. Both the triangulated rhombic dodecahedron and hexahedron networks have 10-connected and 8-connected nades ([7.43a], dodecahedra; and [7.43b], hexahedra). lt is important to point out that neither of these systems suffers from any local instabilities because no new vertices are formed and, therefore, no unsupported planar sets of triangles are to be found. We have Iisted ali but one of those periodic systems composed of equilateral triangles or approximately equilateral triangles that are subsets of the universal network. This is not to say that there are no other systems which relate to the universal net. We will find again and again that the universal node-net concept is constantly reappearing in different forms. We will find that the same principies of symmetry upon which the Universal Nade is based govern an array of periodic structures which, although they are not : subsets of the universal net, do relate to. it in sophisticated and subtle ways. ·\n \n Triangulated Structures\n \n b 7.43 Network of space filling triangulated rhombic dodecahedra (a); network of space filling triangulated rhombic hexahedra (b).\n \n 8\n \n In our inventory of space filling systems we have seen two major subsets of the Universal Node: the 6-connected node of the sim pie cubic network which incorporates ali of the [ 100] directions available on the no de [8.1 a]; and the 12-connected node of the tetrahedral/octahedral fcc network which incorporates ali of the [ 11 O] directions of the node [8.1 b]. We have notas yet observed the result of connecting the eight [111] directions of the node [8.1c]. This results in an 8-connected [8.1 d] network that does not define any plane-faced polyhedron. lts nodes are the site of the bcc lattice, and it is closely related to the network formed by space filling tetragonal disphenoids [8.1 e]. lf the [1 00] branches are removed from this latter tetrahedral network, the 8-connected bcc net results.\n \n Saddle Polyhedra andthe Universal Network. The Cube Revisited\n \n We now have three uniform networks; these constitute the most symmetrical possibilities for the periodic subdivision of space. They are equivalent to the simpie cubic, body centered cubic, and face centered cubic lattices and, therefore, ali have fui I cubic symmetry. We note that symmetry can be preserved even with _ \"incomplete\" nodes, i.e., a node with spokes for only the six [ 100] directions, will still retain fui I cubic symmetry, as will a node with only the eight [111] directions, o r one with only the twelve [ 11 O] directions [8.2]. There are no other periodic networks in which the nodes have this much symmetry.* The universal network is a combination of the three most symmetrical coordinate systems into one comprehensive system. *The 14-connected node of the unary tetrahedron (tetragonal disphenoidal) system has fui I cubic symmetry but because it has two kinds of branches, ([100] and [111] branches), it does not forma completely homogeneous structure. As I have already pointed out, this 14-connected net is a combination ofthe simple cubic and bcc nets.\n \n b\n \n a\n \n e\n \n d\n \n 8.1 The Un iversa I No de con nector with ali six possible [I 00] branches attached (a); with ali twelve possible [110] branches attached (b); with ali eight possible [111] branches attached (c). Note the repeating network with ali eight possible [111] branches at each node. Nodes fali at sites of bcc lattice (d); repeating network with ali eight possible [111] branches, and with addition of ali six possible [100] branches at each node. Nodes of this 14-connected network also fali at sites of bcc lattice (e).\n \n 86\n \n Minimal Surfaces, Mean Curvature The simple cubic and the fcc networks both have their dual nets, but what of the bcc network just described? lts edges do not define any polyhedron---at /east not any plane-faced polyhedron. The generation of dual space fillers is a reciprocation process: the centers of contiguous polyhedral cells are joined through their common faces .forming a dual space filling network. lf we do not have a polyhedral cell then how can we have a dual space filling network? In ou r earlier discussion (Chapter 5, p. 50; [5. 18]-[5. 19]) of threedimensional connected networks which do not form plane-faced polyhedra, it was pointed out that various kinds of skew polygonal circuits are formed. lt is possible to span such a nonplanar skew polygon with a so-called minimal surface, forming a doubly curved saddle shaped module. A minimal surface is a surface of zero mean curvature; such a surface can be associated with any closed polygon. lf the polygon is flat, the minimal surface will be flat. lf the polygon is skew, then the minimal surface will be warped, with its positive curvature exactly equal to its negative curvature; hence the surface wi li be of a saddle shape. Directions\n \n Symmetry\n \n 2·fold\n \n 3·fold\n \n 4·fold\n \n 8.2 Full cubic symmetry is preserved in nades with only [1 00] spokes, or [11 O] spokes, or [111] spokes.\n \n 87\n \n Minimal Surfaces, Mean Curvature\n \n lt was shown by Euler that ali mini mal surfaces must have zero mean curvature at every point of the surface* and that ali such surfaces that are nonplanar must be saddle shaped. A minimal surface can be easily formed by immersing a wire trame in a soap solution. Upon removing it, we find that a very thin film of soap spans the trame, arranging itself so as to have the smallest possible area. The film is stressed in pure tension and is in a state of minimal potential energy. lf such a surface is duplicated in a rigid material, it can form an extremely strong structure of very small thickness with resistance to both compression and tension forces. Although thsy can be easily formed and studied empirically, such minimal surfaces are extremely difficult to treat mathematically.** *Courant and Robbins have defined the minimal surface as follows. \"Consider the perpendicular to the surface at [a point] P, and ali planes containing it. These planes will intersect the surface in curves which, in general, have different curvatures at P. Now consider the curves of minimum and maximum curvature, respectively. (In general, the planes containing these curves will be perpendicular to each other.) One-half the sum ot these two curvatures is the mean curvature of the surface at P.\" **In the 1870s, the Belgian physicist Plateau experimented with minimal-surface soap films. The general problem of mini mal surfaces is usually referred to as Plateau's problem. Mathematically Plateau's problem is exceedingly difficult as it isconnected with the solution of a parti ai differential equation, ora system of such equations.\n \n Saddle Surfaces and lnterstitial Domains Some areas on a saddle surface are flatter than others and, therefore, ali points on the surface do not respond equally well to concentrated loads. When such saddle surfaces are associated in a periodic array, the physical interaction of one surface on another produces a compensatory effect which greatly increases their efficiency as structures. An isolated saddle polygon is nota fully stable structure. lt requires the cooperative effect of associated saddle po/ygons if its advantages as a doub/y curved surface are to be fully realized. This is true whether the surface is a tension system, as in the case of the soap film, ora surface of rigid material capab/e of resisting tension and compression forces. The significance of saddle figures for the theory of modular structure is that threedimensional periodic connected networks that do not describe plane faced polyhedra nonetheless form saddle figures of various kinds. In previous chapters we a/ways started with a polyhedron ora set of polyhedra and then found ways in which these could be generated and combined. For the saddle figures, we are, at least initially, faced with a different problem: the saddle figure must be generated from an existing network. lt is a problem of partitioning off some fundamental vo/umetric region or set of regions with sadd/e (or plane) faces to forma space filling figure ora set of space filling figures. We sha/1 reler to this fundamental spatial region (ora set of regions) as the interstítial domain(s)* of lhe network. The inlerstitial domain is formed by spanning with a minimal surface the group oi po/ygonal circuits that as a nonintersecting set wi/1 combine to forma c/osed po/yhedron or set oi closed po/yhedra. The appropriate group oi polygonal circuits is determined by spanning lhe smal/est, next smallest, ... po/ygons until a closed ce/1 or set of cells is tound. Both unary and multip/e space filling domains can be found by means of this method.\n \n lt is important to emphasize the use oi mínima/ surfaces to generate the faces of interstitial domains. The p/ane-faced polyhedra which compose the space filling systems ofTable 5.1 are interstitial domains of the uniform networks which they define. /f these structures are formed as networks without faces, the faces may be found in the same manner in which the faces of the saddle faced interstitial domains are found, i. e., by spanning with a minimal surface the set of smal/est, next smallest, etc. nonintersecting circuits formed by the constituent polygons which com pose the network which combine to form c/osed polyhedral cel/s.* When the proper interstitial domain (or domains) oi a net are found, fundamental repeating space filling units are formed which greatly increase ou r ability to perceive structure in an array otherwise very difficult to understand. Because of the structural advantages of the saddle surfaces, the saddle polyhedra have significant implications for lhe design of physical structures. *In lhe cases of the dual nets this spanning principie breaks down because of lhe multi pie ways in which identical networks are spanned to form the nodal polyhedra. In such cases, the requirements of duality remove the ambiguities.\n \n The confluence oi the notion oi threedimensional connected networks and that of minimal surfaces has /ed me and others independently to the invention oi a new c/ass of po/yhedra that are cal/edsaddle po/yhedra. A saddle polyhedron is a closed figure formed by a finite number of saddle polygons bounded by straighl edges.* Although, as with plane faced polyhedra, lhere can be an infinite number of saddle polyhedra, only those figures which can be used to build infinite periodic structures are of concern in the present work. Michae/ Burt has studied the limiting case oi a finite set of nonspace-filling sadd/e polyhedra composed oi regular faces which he derives from the Platonic and Archimedean solids.** *A few infinite regular saddle polyhedra have been discovered by Schoen following upon my earlier invention of (finite) saddle polyhedra. Schoen, with whom I have collaborated, has dane major mathematical work on the subject of saddle polyhedra and infinite periodic minimal surfaces, and has discovered many other finite saddle polyhedra which do not fi li space but which satisfy rigorous mathematical criteria for regularity. See bibliography for citations of Schoen's work. **Burt has independently discovered lhe saddle polyhedron concept, although his emphasis is somewhat different than mine. He has studied some of lhe space filling saddle polyhedra and the class of infinite periodic minimal surfaces, which is treated !ater in this book, as well as lhe non-space-filling finite class mentioned above.\n \n 8.3 Space filling bcc saddle tetrahedra.\n \n *This term has been proposed by Schoen, who also refers to lhe domain of lhe vertex (which is simply the polyhedron of lhe dual net) as the symmetry domain. Our nodal polyhedron of Chapter 7 is equivalent to Schoen's symmetry domain. The term nodal polyhedron was originally proposed by Schoen as well.\n \n 88\n \n Saddle Polyhedra and Connected Networks\n \n Saddle Polyhedra\n \n Our first saddle polyhedron is the interstitial domain of the 8-connected bcc network. lt is a saddle tetrahedron bounded by four regular saddle tetragons. We, therefore, see the emergence of a space filling bcc saddle tetrahedron. [8.3]. Secause the bond angles of the bcc network are 70°32', the saddle tetragon faces of the bcc tetrahedron have included angles of 70°32'. Such included angles or face angles are the crucial data necessary to describe particular saddle faces and, therefore, particular saddle polyhedra. As we shall see, the fourteen possible branch angles provided by the Universal No de account for ali of the combi nations of face angles that appear in our sàddle polyhedra. Once we have transformed a conneéted network into an array of space filling saddle polyhedra, it is a sim pie matter to find the dual space filling network. The interstitial domain will be the nodal polyhedron of the dual net. From this, we know that the network which is dual to the bcc net must have 4-connected vertices because the nodal polyhedron of the dual net will be the bcc saddle tetrahedron with four faces. The dual net of the bcc net is the coplanar 90° 4-connected network of [5.18a]. The interstitial domain of this dual net is a saddle octahedron bounded by regular saddie hexagons with included angles of 90° corresponding to bond angles of the net. This space filling bcc saddle octahedron is then the nodal polyhedron of the bcc network [8.4]. '\n \n Polyhedra with Less than Four Faces\n \n We find that the network of this saddle bcc octahedron [8.5], like the bcc network itself, is also a subset of the universal net in which four [1 00] directions meet at each node. In fact, ali of the networks described in Chapter 5 are subsets of the universal network. Some also generate extremely significant saddle polyhedra. The 3-connected Laves network of the decagon circuits [5.17a], has as its interstitial domain a saddle trihedron [8.6] bounded by three saddle decagons with included angles of 120°. The nade of this net is a coplanar subset of the [110] directions in which three [11 O] branches meet at 120° in a common plane. This network is shown in [8.7] (which the reader will recognize as being the same as [5.17a].)\n \n A closed plane-faced polyhedron must have at least four faces. This is no longer true if nonplanar faces are allowed. We see that the saddle trihedron is not only a three-faced polyhedron, but that it is even a unary space filler. This trihedron, like many of the saddle polyhedra we will soon examine, has certain vertices at which only two edges meet. Such 2-connected vertices do not occur amongst any of the plane-faced polyhedra. lt might be said that such vertices make possible the existence of saddle polyhedra. Surprisingly, even the saddle polyhedra with such 2-connected vertices sti li satisfy Euler's theorem for polyhedra (p. 32): faces+ vertices = edges + 2. This is so, because for every 2-connected vertex there must also be an extra edge. This saddle decatrihedron of the Laves network has the symmetry of a triangular prism: one axis of 3-fold symmetry and three axes of 2-fold symmetry. The dual of the decatrihedronal space filling system is the mirrar image of the original network, i.e., the system is an enantiomorphic self-dual. A model of these dual networks juxtaposed is shown in [8.8].\n \n 8.5 Network of space filling bcc saddle octahedra. 8.6 Space filling saddle decatrihedra.\n \n 8.7 Network of space filling saddle decatrihedra.\n \n 8.4 Space filling bcc saddle octahedra.\n \n 8.8 By juxtaposing networks of right- and lefthanded space filling decatrihedra we see them to be duais to each other.\n \n 89\n \n Connected Networks\n \n The Diamond Network\n \n Wurtzite and Carborundum\n \n The 4-connected diamond net was also introduced in Chapter5 [5.18b]. In its simplicity and symmetry, it is one of the most fundamental of ali periodic structures. lt is rivaled only by the three cubic nets in the hierarchy of fundamental three-dimensional structures. The node of the diamond net is a subset of the bcc node; it has four [111] directions disposed at 109°28' angles. lt is assembled by attaching [111] branches to every other [111] directed spoke on the Universal Nade [8.9].\n \n Wurtzite, a form of zinc sulfide, and Carborundum 111, a form of silicon carbide, are two crystals whose atomic positions are the same as in diamond. (Wells 1962a). Therefore, their networks appear to be identical to the diamond network. The use of saddle polyhedra as interstitial domains, however, enables us to clearly distinguish the subtle differences between these seemingly identical structures.\n \n The interstitial domain of the diamond net is a saddle tetrahedron bounded by four regular hexagonal saddle faces with included angles of 109°28' [8.10]. This diamond tetrahedron has the symmetry of the regular tetrahedron. The nodal polyhedron of the diamond net is another diamond tetrahedron. lt is a self-dual. The diamond network and the simple cubic network are the only self-dual uniform networks. lf eriantiomorphism is permitted, the 3-connected Laves network also qualifies as a self-dual. There are apparently no others, although this has not been proven mathematically.* *There is also one semiuniform net with two kinds of nades which is a self-dual. This is discussed later in this chapter. lt is interesting to note that the regular tetrahedron is the only plane-faced finite polyhedron which is a selfdual and the diamond saddle tetrahedron with fui I tetrahedral symmetry gives rise to a selfdual space filling system.\n \n Both wurtzite and Carborundum 111 may be assembled from the Universal Node system but neither are subsets of the universal network. The wurtzite structure is a subset of the trapezorhombic dodecahedron net and its overall symmetry is hexagonal rather than cubic. Like the diamond net, ali of its nades are alike surrounded by four branches meeting at 109°28'. lt is necessary to use both twisted and nontwisted [111] branches to assemble this structure with the Universal Node System [8. 11] The wurtzite is less symmetrical than the diamond structure, and so is composed of two interstitial domains: a trihedron bounded by three saddle hexagons of 2-fold symmetry, and a pentahedron bounded by two regular saddle hexagons and three 2-fold saddle hexagons [8.12]. Ali included angles for these various saddle faces are of necessity 109°28'.\n \n 8. li Four-connected network of wurtzite. 8.12 Wurtzite structure formed by space filling of saddle trihedra and saddle pentahedra.\n \n 8.9 The 4-connected diamond network. 8. I O The diamond saddle tetrahedra.\n \n 90\n \n The Carborundum 111 structure is like both the diamond and wurtzite networks in that ali of its nodes are 4-connected with [111] branches (twisted and nontwisted) disposed coequally at 109°28' [8. 13]. However, the interstitial regions of this network give rise to three polyhedral domains: the wurtzite pentahedron and trihedron and the diamond tetrahedron.The admixture of these three polyhedra in a ternary space fi li i ng system defines the Carborundum 111 net [8. 14].\n \n Saddle Polyhedra\n \n 8.13 Four-connected network of Carborundum 111. 8.14 Carborundum 111 structure formed by space filling of saddle trihedra, saddle pentahedra, and diamond saddle tetrahedra.\n \n Unlike the diamond net, neither the wurtzite nor Carborundum nets are selfduals, although the nodal polyhedra of the wurtzite and Carborundum nets are very similar to the diamond tetrahedron. Wurtzite has a tetrahedron bounded by one plane regular hexagon and three saddle hexagons with 2-fold symmetry, while Carborundum requires two nodal polyhedra. Both are, of course, tetrahedra: one is bounded by one regular plane hexagon and three saddle hexagons with only mirror symmetry; and the other is bounded by the same three saddle hexagons, but with a single regular saddle hexagon with included face angles of 109°28'. Although the net of the wurtzite nodal tetrahedra can be assembled with the Universal Node system, the pair of Carborundum nodal tetrahedra cannot. The Carborundum network is, in fact, a mixture of cubic and hexagonal structures. Because of this, the Carborundum nodal polyhedra require a special set of branch angle relationships which cannot b,e accommodated by the Universal Node connector. lt is possible, however, to assemble the wurtzite nodal polyhedron in a configuration which is topologically equivalent to the network formed by the packing of Carborundum nodal tetrahedra.\n \n Describing the Universal Network with Saddle Polyhedra I have notas yet described the interstitial domains or nodal polyhedra for the universal net. We already know that there will be two kinds ofnodal polyhedra dueto the two kinds of nodal subsets. I have noted in Chapter 6 that the universal network has three 6-connected nodes for every 26-connected node. We know from this that we are looking for a multiple space filling system which consists of a 26-faced nodal polyhedron with fui I cubic symmetry and a 6-faced nodal polyhedron with tetragonal symmetry which together fi li space in the ratío of one to three. There is no example of such an array in our space filling inventory (Table 5.1) so we can be fairly sure that we will need saddle polyhedra. We find that the interstitial domains of the universal net consist of two kinds of polyhedra: an orthorhombic* saddle tetrahedron bounded by four 2-fold saddle quadri laterais (face ang les of 90°, 45°, 90°, 45°); and an enantiomorphic pai r of trihedra, each bounded by the same two right triangular faces (included angles of 90°, 54°44', 35°16',) and one 2-fold saddle quadrilateral [8.15]. This trihedron has one axis of 2-fold symmetry. This set fills space in the ratio of one tetrahedron for every four trihedra. We shall cal I its members the universal tetrahedron and universal trihedron. These interstitial domains tell us that the dual network which defines the nodal polyhedra will have two kinds of vertices. Careful examination of these interstitial polyhedra shows that there will be 3-connected nodes with branches meeting at 120° on a common plane and 4-connected nodes with branches meeting at 90° on a common plane. The nodal polyhedra that are generated are of considerable interest. *Figures of the orthorhombic class have three 2-fold axes of symmetry.\n \n 8.15 lnterstitial domains of the universal network: universal tetrahedron and an enantiomorphic pai r of universal trihedra.\n \n 91\n \n Describing the Universal Network\n \n The 26-faced nodal polyhedron of the Universal Node is bounded by eight plane regular hexagonal faces in the [111] directions, twelve 2-fold saddle hexagons in the [110] directions (face ang les of 90° and 120°), and six 4-fold saddle dodecagons in the [1 00] directions (face ang les 90° and 120°). The sixfaced nodal polyhedron is bounded by two of the 4-fold saddle dodecagons in the [1 00] directions, and four of the 2-fold saddle hexagons in the [110] directions. These we will cal I the universal cuboctadodecahedron and the universal hexahedron; they are shown in [8.16]. These two polyhedra fi li space in the ratio of 1:3, justas the nodal ratio of the universal network leads us to expect. A space filling array is shown in [8.17]. The universal cuboctadodecahedron has fui I cubic symmetry and the universal hexahedron has tetragonal symmetry, so the symmetry requirements of the nodes are satisfied.\n \n 8.16 Nodal polyhedra of the universal network: universal cuboctadodecahedron and universal hexahedron. 8.17 Space filling of universal cuboctadodecahedra and universal hexahedra.\n \n Visualizing the Universal Network\n \n The universal network may be visualized with the aid of an assembly of three enantiomorphic pairs of universal trihedra. These six trihedra share a common [111] branch when grouped and their collective vertices fali exactly at the eight corners of the cube [8.18]. The corresponding relative branch lengths are: for the [1 00] direction, 1; for [11 O], v2; and for [111 ], \\13. Note that in this cubical assembly two opposite vertices are 7-connected and that the additional six vertices are only 2-connected. lf such a cubical assembly is packed with others of the same species, such that the 7-connected corners are always matched and that 2-connected corners are always matched, each collection of 7-connected vertices becomes a 26-connected vertex; i.e., a Universal Node vertex, and each collection of 2-connected vertices becomes a 6-connected vertex. A space filling collection of these cubically assembled trihedra gives rise to a second interstitial space which takes the form of the universal tetrahedron. The ratio of three 6-connected nodes for every 26-connected node is clearly explained by the cu bicai assembly of trihedra. Note that there are two 7-connected nodes for every six 2-connected nodes: i.e., a ratio of one to three. A space filling array of universal trihedra and universal tetrahedra can be seen in [8.19].\n \n 92\n \n 8.18 Cu bicai assembly of three enantiomorphic pairs of universal trihedra can repeat to describe the universal network. 8.19 Space filling of universal trihedra and universal tetrahedra. ·\n \n The unit cell of the universal network is an array of eight cubical sets of six universal trihedra. This complex will repeat by simpie translation along the [1 00] directions to define the entire universal network. lts network is shown in [8.20a] along with the network of the cu bicai set of six universal trihedra [8.20b]. The cubical set of six trihedra will repeat to define theentire ~ structure but not by simple translation since a reflection through [100]-directed mirror planes ora rotation about ali [100] branches is required. We see in the unit cell of the universal net that the 26connected Universal Nodes fali on the sites of the body centered cubic lattice, and the 6-connected Universal Node subsets fali on three-fourths of the sites of the simple cubic lattice. 8.20 The un it cell of the universal network (a), and the network of the cu bicai set of six universal trihedra showing the sites of the 26-connected and 6-connected Universal Nades (b).\n \n Saddle Polyhedra\n \n Regular and Semiregular Saddle Polyhedra I now return to a discussion of the general characteristics of the saddle polyhedra. We have already seen that there can be an infinite number of saddle polyhedra, and I have already restricted our inquiry to those polyhedra that can be used to assemble infinite periodic structures. Because saddle polyhedra usually have sets of vertices in which two edges meet, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find saddle polyhedra which have ali their vertices alike. Because of this, there are no simple cases of regular or semi regular saddle polyhedra. Schoen has identified a set of nine finite regular saddle polyhedra in which ali vertices are uniform, but these are comparable to the KeplerPoinsot stellated polyhedra in which faces are permitted to intersect.* Thr13e of these regular saddle polyhedra are related to the regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and cube, respectively. The six others are related to the icosahedron and cannot form periodic structures. The former three are shown in [8.21]. They are the tetrahedral hemihexahedron with three saddle tetragons (60° angles) at each vertex and 3 intersecting faces; the octahedral hemioctahedron with four saddle hexagons (60° and 90° angles) at each vertex and 4 intersecting faces; and the cubic hemioctahedron with three saddle hexagons (60°, 90°, 90°, 90° ang les) at each vertex and four intersecting faces** As far as I know, the only regular and semiregular saddle polyhedra which do not have intersecting faces are infinite systems. Some of these will be described in Chapter 9. These are derived from space fillings of finite saddle polyhedra with certain of their faces omitted; they have also been identified by Schoen (1970).\n \n Of ali of the saddle polyhedra that we will examine (which total altogether over fifty examples), there are four which have special significance, three of which have already been described (the bcc tetrahedron, the bcc octahedron, and the diamond tetrahedron). They are characterized by the fact that they are bounded exclusively by one kind of regular skew polygon. lf it were not for the fact that they each have a secondary set of 2-connected vertices, and, therefore, have two kinds of vertices, these polyhedra would qualify as regular polyhedra. When they are packed to fill space, the 2-connected vertices disappear and only one kind of vertex remains. These figures and the nets to which they belong are uniform and constitute a unique class of polyhedra, perhaps as uni que as the Platonic figures.\n \n 8.22 Space filling of tetrahedral decahedra. 8.23 Network of space filling tetrahedral decahedra is 6-connected subset of 12connected fcc network.\n \n *Schoen (1968a). These are the metric realizations of a class of regular maps enumerated by Coxeter and Moser (1964, p. 112). **The names of these polyhedra are dueto Norman Johnson.\n \n 8.21 Regular saddle polyhedra: octahedral hemioctahedron, tetrahedral hemihexahedron, and cubic hemioctahedron.\n \n 93\n \n A fourth saddle polyhedron ranks with the foregoing three in importance. lt is a tensided polyhedron bounded by six regular skew saddle quadrilaterals (60° angles) and four regular skew hexagons (60° angles) [8.22]. lt has tetrahedral symmetry and we shall cal I it the tetrahedral decahedron. lt is a unary space filling polyhedron and is derived from a 6-connected (rather than fully 12-connected) version of the fcc network [8.23]. Because it has more than one kind of regular face it is analogous to the semiregular polyhedra, except, again, for the fact of the 2-connected vertices. The 6-connected fcc network is yet another branch system that may be used to connect the points of a given lattice. These four polyhedra-the bcc tetrahedron, the bcc octahedron, the diamond tetrahedron, and the tetrahedral decahedron-are the only known saddle polyhedra, which fill space alone or in combination with other polyhedra, that are bounded exclusively by regular saddle polygons.\n \n Regular and Semiregular\n \n Characteristics of Skew Polygons\n \n The many additional saddle polyhedra that have been discovered are bounded by a variety of skew polygonal faces of varying degrees of symmetry. In review, the regular polygon is defined as any circuit, plane or skew, of straight line segments that is equilateral and equiangular and in which ali vertices are equidistant from a common central point. In projection, ali regular skew polygons can be made to yield regular plane polygons. As we are about to see, the requirement of equal edges and equal angles is not enough to uniquely define a regular skew polygon. Note that while the rotational symmetry of a regular plane polygon corresponds exactly to the number of sides, the rotational symmetry of a regular skew polygon is exactly half the number of sides. For example, a plane square has 4-fold symmetry, while a regular skew tetragon has only 2-fold symmetry. A regular plane hexagon has 6-fold symmetry, while a regular skew hexagon wili have only 3-fold symmetry.\n \n A curious class of polygons emerges which, although it consists of equal edges and equal included angles, is stili not regular because of the particular manner in which the included angles are directed. An example of this is the skew decagon of the decatrihedron we have already discussed. This saddle polygon is equilateral and equiangular but has only 2-fold symmetry. Ali of its ang les are 120°, but these are oriented in such a manner that an irregular 2-fold ten-sided polygon is formed [8.24]. Two other examples of this class of face are found in the faces of a truncated tetrahedral decahedron which is bounded by four regular plane hexagons, six saddle octagons and four saddle dodecagons [8.25]. Both of the saddle faces are equiangular (120° included angles) and equilateral. However, they are not regular-the octagon has only 2-fold symmetry and the dodecagon has only 3-fold symmetry. As suggested by an examination of the polyhedron to which these faces belong, the octagon is simply a truncated regular saddle quadri lateral of 60° angles and the dodecagon is a truncated regular saddle hexagon of 60° ang les. The truncated polygons have the same symmetry as their parent figures.\n \n Another frequently occurring class of skew polygons consists of equal sides but face angles of two different kinds. Such polygons frequently appear to be regular when viewed in projection and tend to be relatively symmetrical. They have two classes of vertices, one set of which falis at the intersection of two edges which when viewed in projection have included angles of 180°. This has the effect of transforming an n-gon into a (n I 2)-gon when it is viewed in plan. An example of this class of skew polygon is an eight-sided saddle polygon with equal edges but included angles of 60° and 90°. Another example is an octagon with included angles of 70°32' and 109°28' [8.26]. These octagons have 4-fold symmetry. In the inventory of saddle polyhedra there are also various saddle polygons which consist of two kinds of edges and two kinds of included angles. There are also saddle polygons which have two edge types and one kind of included angle. 8.26 Skew octagon (4-fold symmetry).\n \n I\n \n ~ 8.24 Skew decagon of decatrihedron (2-fold symmetry). 8.25 Skew octagon (2-fold symmetry, a), and skew dodecagon (3-fold symmetry, b) are the faces of a truncated tetrahedral decahedron.\n \n a\n \n b\n \n 94\n \n w o o I I\n \n Saddle Polyhedra\n \n +\n \n Saddle Polyhedra: An lnventory of Possibilities\n \n Because of ou r success with the universal netas a means of accounting for ali of the space filling systems composed of planefaced polyhedra, and because it is also possible to consider the nets of ali of the saddle polyhedra so far described to be subsets of the universal net, we wi li consideron/y.those additional saddle polyhedra and related nets which can be defined by this system. Many different modes of exploration were used to discover numerous saddle polyhedra. In some cases, they have been derived directly from networks. This is how the concept first saw realization-the bcc tetrahedron and diamond tetrahedron being the first discovered in that order. Many others were derived by a process of truncçltion of vertices or augmentation of vertices. New uniform and semiuniform* networks have been derived by an exploration of the various combinatorial possibilities of previously established saddle polyhedra or saddle polygons. The Universal Node concept is a powerful tool for the systematic empirical exploration and analysis of the concept of periodic nets as they relate to saddle polyhedra.\n \n Many saddle polyhedra and saddle polyhedral space filling systems have been discovered. I have not attempted to exhaust ali of the possible combinations and permutations of the universal net system which will give rise to uniform or semiuniform saddle polyhedral networks. There is no question that there are additional structures to be discovered, particularly in the realm of the larger class of semiuniform networks. How many more is difficult to suggest. Table 8.1 lists 53 saddle polyhedra, ali of which relate to periodic networks which are identified in Table 8.2. Only those saddle polyhedra are described that are components of space filling systems and that are, therefore, related to the global behavior of the periodic structures to which they belong-again, a synthesis of the parts and the whole.* * No attempt has been made to consider the set of dual polyhedra for the finite saddle polyhedron cells. Because of the typical 2-connected vertices of the finite saddle polyhedron cells, their duais are not obvious andare subject to some interpretation.\n \n Forty-two space filling combinations are possible with the saddle pàlyhedra listed in Table 8.1. These saddle polyhedral space filling systems are enumerated in Table 8.2, and recipes for the construction of their networks using the Universal Node system are given. Models of 38 of these 42 systems are shown [8.65]-[8.96] as packings of closed polyhedra assembled from plastic surfaces, and as networks assembled from Universal Node connectors and branches. From these many examples of saddle polyhedral systems we again see the extraordinary range of options provided by the Universal Node system within the constraints of a very simple set of geometric relationships. Quite clearly, the minimum inventory/maximum diversity concept posited earlier has been powerfully fulfilled with the Universal Node system.\n \n *We know that a periodic network is uniform when ali of its vertices are equivalent (congruent). A semiuniform network is a system in which more than one kind of vertex appears, but which is still• periodic. Typically, semiuniform nets have two or three kinds of vertices and there are a few which have u-p to four different vertex types.\n \n 95\n \n Complete specifications of the 53 saddle polyhedra are given in Table 8.1. They are identified according to their symmetry and grouped according to the numbers of faces. Names have been derived which reflect either their symmetry properties or their origins and/or the number of faces. or ali ofthese factors. In effect, recipes are given in Table 8.1 for the construction of these saddle polyhedra using the Universal Node system. Models are shown for 38 of these 53 saddle polyhedra. Figures [8.27]-[8.64] show two views of each of these polyhedra assembled from piasti c surfaces and a third view of the network of the polyhedron assembled from Universal Node connectors and branches.\n \n An lnventory of Possibilities\n \n Table 8.1 Saddle Polyhedra Classified According to the Universal Node® System\n \n Symmetry Axes Saddle Polyhedron\n \n iComplete recipes are given for 53 saddle polyhedra. Although the list is not exhaustive it does include the most important known saddle polyhedra. The second column identifies the number o f symmetry axes each of 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotation. The third column lists the symmetry class within which each polyhedron falls. In addition to the seven c rystal classes already described, the terms triangular, digonal, and tetrahedral have also been used to indicate symmetry. Triangular refers to figures which have the symmetry of an equilateral triangular prism. Digonal refers to figures which have only a single 2-fold rotation axis. Tetrahedral refers to figures with the symmetry of the regular tetrahedron. The nodal characteristics are g iven in the fourth column. Note that ali of the saddle polyhedra have two kinds of nodes-a primary and a secondary. The secondary nodes in ali but two cases are 2-connected vertices. Complete specifications are given regarding the numbers and types of branches and faces.

Unary Space Fillers and Uniform Networks\n \n Diverse Networks Share Common Point Lattices\n \n Of the 42 space filling systems that are listed in Table 8.2, we note that 14 are unary space filling saddle polyhedrawhich brings the total of ali unary space filling polyhedra we have as yet inventoried (including plane faced polyhedra) up to 35. We have seen that there are an infinite number of space fi li ing polyhedra; the significance, therefore, of newly discovered systems is a function of the ordering principies from which they are derived. The 14 unary space filling saddle polyhedra are not ali of equal stature. As I have already suggested, the bcc tetrahedron, bcc nodal octahedron, the diamond tetrahedron, and the tetrahedral decahedron are the most important of these unary systems. lncluding these four, there are 8 unary systems which define uniform networks a(\\long the 14 unary sadd Ie polyhedral space filling systems. The six remaining space filling saddle polyhedra define semiuniform networks. The total number of unary space filling saddle and flat polyhedra which define uniform nets is 13: the eight saddle polyhedra plus the cube, truncated octahedron, triangular prism, hexagonal prism and tetragonal disphenoid.\n \n Now that we have inventoried a vast collection of orderly spatial networks it should be useful to summarize which networks share common point lattices. As the reader should by now expect, each of the three most symmetrical point lattices-simple cubic (p), bcc, and fcc-can be alternatively interlinked with branches to form vastly different networks.\n \n Perhaps far more significant a concept than that of unary space filling is that of the uniform net. Our inventory shows a total of 17 uniform nets formed by the saddle polyhedra. In addition to the eight formed by unary systems, eight are formed as binary systems and one as a ternary system. lf we add to that the fourteen cubic space filling systems, ali of which are uniform nets, plus the nine uniform nets from the hexagonal class, we have a grand total of 40 uniform nets. lf we àdd the total of 42 saddle polyhedral space filling systems (uniform and semiuniform) to ali those systems previously inventoried, we find a total of 92 different space filling systems. Eighty-five of these systems may be accounted for by the Universal Node system (with topological license permitted in the hexagonal system). See Chapter 7, pp. 74-84.\n \n 107\n \n As mentioned in Chapter 6 and as shown in [8.20], ali the nades of the universal network fali at the sites of a simple cubic lattice. This fact reveals the importance and usefulness of considering spatial organization in terms of networks rather than solely in terms of lattice points. The position of points in space in no way predicts the interlinkages between points. lt is clear that a given point lattice (or point lattice subset) may be the basis of many different uniform and semiuniform networks. lt is startling to realize that the simple cubic lattice usually identified with the 6-connected cubical network gives ri se to a structure of such apparent complexity as the universal network. Another example in our inventory with its nades positioned at the sites of the simple cubic lattice is the 18/ 6-connected net found with space filling of cubical saddle hexahedra and universal tetrahedra. ([8.86], No. 27, Table 8.2.) The bcc lattice gives rise to a host of uniform and semiuniform networks. There are four uniform networks: the 14-connected tetragonal disphenoid net; the 8-connected bcc tetrahedron net ([8.67], No. 3, Table 8.2); the 10-connected triangular hexahedron net ([8.70], No. 6, Table 8.2); and the 14-connected digonal trihedron net ([8.72], Table 8.2). Among the space filling systerris dual to the regular and semiregular polyhedra space filling systems (Table 5.1 ), there are three semiuniform networks with their nades positioned on the bcc lattice, including space filling of rhombic hexahedra [5.11 b] (4/8-connected); square pyramid [5.11c], tetragonal octahedron [5.11d] and rhombic pyramid [5.11 p] (ali on the same 8/14-connected net); and, finally the right triangular pyramid [5.11 m] (24/14/8-connected).\n \n Common Point Lattices\n \n The fcc lattice can be formed by the 12connected tetrahedra/octahedra space filling system, the 6-connected tetrahedral decahedron system ([8.69], No. 5, Table 8.2), and the 8-connected fcc tetragonal tetrahedron/fcc orthorhombic tetrahedron system ([8. 76], No. 16, Table 8.2), ali of which are uniform networks. The aforementioned is not an exhaustive list of networks; in particular, many more semiuniform cases may be given. lt is interesting to note that of the alternative uniform systems, each lattice (p, bcc, fcc) accounts for a single plane-faced polyhedral system, i. e., packings of cubes (p), tetragonal disphenoids (bcc), or tetrahedra and octahedra (fcc). The remaining uniform networks are systems composed of saddle polyhedra of various kinds, again emphasizing the morphological significance of the saddle polyhedra. We will come to appreciate the saddle polyhedra even more in the next chapter as we go on to describe a special class of systems derived from the special properties of polyhedra bounded by mini mal surfaces.\n \n Table 8.2 Space Filling with Saddle Polyhedra\n \n Space Filling System I\n \n Decatrihedron (right) [8.65]\n \n 2\n \n Diamond tetrahedron [8.66]\n \n Entry in Table 8.1\n \n Space Filling Net Ratio Type\n \n z\n \n uniform\n \n 3\n \n li\n \n uniform\n \n 4\n \n 3 bcc tetrahedron [8.67]\n \n 12\n \n uniform\n \n 8\n \n bcc octahedron [8.68]\n \n 40\n \n uniform\n \n 4\n \n 5 Tetrahedral decahedron [8.69]\n \n 43\n \n uniform\n \n 6\n \n 6 Triangular hexahedron [8.70]\n \n 27\n \n uniform\n \n 10\n \n 7 Truncated tetrahedral decahedron [8. 71]\n \n 46\n \n uniform\n \n 3\n \n 8 Dígonal trihedron\n \n 4\n \n uniform\n \n 14\n \n 16\n \n semiuniforfT)\n \n 6\n \n 8.65\n \n 8.66\n \n In this table are listed\n \n 8.67\n \n 42 space filling combinations that are possible with lhe polyhedra given in Table 8.1.

This is true at least in lhe sense that lhe nodal polyhedra of the space filling systems which are composed of regular and semi regular polyhedra are clearly of a separate category if for no other reason than that they are not bounded by regular faces.

Acknowledgments<br>\n <br>\n The birth-or, it may be, the efflorescence into my conscious awareness-of the work presented in this book dates back to 1958 when I was a senior at the lnstitute of Design in Chicago. At that time I attempted to designa paperboard dwelling system in which -significantly varied structural configurations could be assembléd from a minimum number of types of mass-produced components. This project was a brief design effort involving a couple of scale models, which were unsuccessful in both their modular and their structural effectiveness. The general problem seemed to me even then to be extremely important; however, the course of my life was such that the idea slipped back into my unconscious for a number of years. As time passed, and I became inspired by the work of Charles Eames, Konrad Wachsmann, Buckminster Fuller, and D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, the problem gradually reemerged; and it became the basis of a serious and extensive investigation in 1965 when I was awarded aresearch fellowship by the Graham Foundation for a study of \"Structurally Autonomous, Geometrically Adaptable Cellular Systems.\" At that time, I knew virtually nothing about geometry, ar)d in particular about polyhedra and the related ideas which are the primary subject of this book. lt was uphill from there. The main themes of this book are: a systematic and, I hope, a comprehensive study of three-dimensional spatial systems; a theory of their interrelationships; and the possibilities for the application of such systems-or at least some of them-to structural and architectural design. I imagine that the book will find its greatest use amongst designers and architects. Yet the work presents a novel application of concepts usually only met with in the sciences; furthermore, a good part of it is devoted to concrete visualizations-by way of photographs of models -{)f structures dealt with more abstractly by scientists, who usually speak a mathematical parlance accessible only to initiates. Whether my variations on the theme of space-filling will have some application in the physical sciences I cannot say. Yet perhaps the visualizations contained herein may hold some interest for mathematicians, biologists, physicists, chemists, and, especially, crystallographers.<br>\n <br>\n X<br>\n <br>\n The form of the presentation in this book stems from a strong empírica! bias; hence, geometry is approached in a deliberately concrete way. By virtue of this approach, readers without mathemi:üical backgrounds should be able to follow the development of the subject. At the same time, I hope that my presentation will withstand the scrutiny of readers trained in mathematics and science. I have attempted to create a book that is self-contained, so that the development of ideas can be followed without the use of outside references. However, nume~ous references are given for the serious student of morphology and geometry. Although they have expanded into more comprehensive systems, most of the concepts presented in this book were described in preliminary form in a report to the Graham Foundation in the fali of 1966, entitled \"Synestructics, the Study of Universal Structure.\" Since \"practical application\" has been an important emphasis in my work, and since many proprietary inventions have evolved as part of this work, a company was founded in 1970, called Synestructics, Inc., to pursue the \"reduction to practice\" of such inventions. Although Synestructics, Inc. is not currently applying these ideas and inventions on an architectural scale, it is gradually moving in that direction and will accelerate its p.ctivity in that area as sufficient capital becomes available for development. The ultimate corporate goal of Synestructics, Inc. isto be fully engaged in the business of producing architectural systems. In the meantime, the company has introduced a line of \"geometrical\" educational toys and games, and playground equipment inc! uding \"SuperStructures,\" \"NetResults,\" \"Curved Space,\" ''TetraKite,\" \"SuperTetraKite,\" \"Sky Links Kite System,\" \"PuzzlePatterns,\" \"SnowCrystals,\" \"Great Shapes,\" and \"Rhombones: Better Blocks.\" Ali of these products are available in toy stores and through some educational distributors as well as directly from Synestructics, Inc. This book does not describe these products directly with the exception of SuperStructures® which is identified as the Universal Node® system in this book, and Curved Space (which exists as both a geometric toy and a large scale recreational environment), which is an application of systems descrrbed herewith as saddle polyhedra and continuous surfaces.<br>\n <br>\n xi<br>\n <br>\n I mention these products here because they ali represent three-dimensional visualizations and realizations of concepts that are often difficult to understand in the abstract or even with the help of illustrations. Those who find this book of interest may find some of these products useful. I owe thanks to many people who, during the course of my investigations and the preparation of this book, offered their encouragement, inspiration, and technical assistance. I would first like to thank the Graham Foundation and its former director, John Entenza, for awarding me a fellowship in 1965 for the initial research and a g rant in 1968 to prepare some further material towards the completion of this book. Konrad Wachsmann, Buckminster Fui ler, and Charles Eames provided both inspiration and direct encouragement, and for this I am most grateful. Most recently the completion of this book was supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington,<br>\n <br>\n D.C. I would like to thank Alan Schoen for his enthusiastic interest in my work, for his lively and inspired conversation, and for his helpful clarification of certain mathematical concepts. I am indebted to both Arthur Loeb and Edwin Schlossberg, not only for their continuing interest in my work, but also for their criticai review of and constructive suggestions for the original manuscript; and to Arthur Loeb and Gyorgy Kepes for bringing my work to the attention of the MIT Press. For their co IIective assistance in model building, illustration, photography, and other technical areas, I would also like to thank Robert Brooks, Roger Conrad, Toby Cowan, Robert Fui ler, Mark Jurey, and Steve Selkowitz. I would also like to thank the many individuais and institutions-listed in the Photo and Picture Credits-who supplied the beautiful photographs of structure in nature which appear in Chapter 2. Special gratitude is also dueto Keto Soosaar for his enthusiastic appreciation of my work, and for his encouragement resulting from ourongoing discussions of the implications and validity of specific structural system applications. I also owe him thanks for his contribution of the Curved Space structural analysis as reported in Chapter 14.<br>\n <br>\n Preface and Acknowledgments<br>\n <br>\n Finally, and most importantly, I would like to thank my wife, Susan, who not only built hundreds of models of ali kinds, did a large percentage of the inking of the drawings, and helped me with the photography, but also typed the manuscript and contributed extensively to its preparation and editing. Without her dedication and extensive help, the completion of this book would plainly not have been possible.<br>\n <br>\n Systems for Diversity<br>\n <br>\n I ntroduction<br>\n <br>\n Man's successful fit into the bui lt environment depends on the possibi lities for change and adaptation within a context of conservative resource use. Such possibilities are a function of diversity and efficiency of form, and such diversity of form can enhance man's relationship to his environment. Technological man's pervasive reliance upon standardized undifferentiated form minimizes the possibility for diversity.<br>\n <br>\n In [1.1] I show a geometric scheme that exemplifies the minimum inventory I maximum diversity concept. Four geometric modules, A, B, C, and D, combine into basic (cellular) units, which in turn form endless varieties by combination and permutation. Although this demonstration is only diagrammatic, it begins to illustrate the range of diversity that can be generated from a kit of standardized components.<br>\n <br>\n The work presented in this book attempts to provide a basis for a rapprochement between the principie of standardization and the need for diversity and change in envirbnmental structures. When properly used, the principie of component standàrdization is a system of g reat production and distribution efficiency; it can also be a system which conserves natural resources. In a fundamental way, standardization is a principie of modularity. We need to develop a building strategy with which diversity and change can be accomplished by modular systems which are efficient in their use of natural material and energy resources. Systems can be envisaged which consist of some minimum inventory of component types which can be alternatively combined to yield a great diversity of efficient structural form. We cal i these minimum inventory/maximum diversity systems. By such a \"system\" I mean a minimized inventory of component types (a kit of parts) along with rubrics whereby the components may be combined. In the best systems, as we shall see, the rubrics lead not to constriction, but to a maximization of different, though generically related, structural forms. We wi li uncover such rubrics by considering the properties of space-of form itself. One characteristic of successful systems wi li be that the rubrics-the rules of assemblageand the physical components themselves will be seen to be organically related: the rules will be seen to grow out of the parts, the parts out of the rules. How different from so much of contemporary architecture's divorce of material and method!<br>\n <br>\n xii<br>\n <br>\n 1.1 A minimum inventory/maximum diversity system.<br>\n <br>\n Structure in Nature In an attempt to understand the concept of minimum inventory/maximum diversity systems we are drawn to nature~ Consider the vast number of substances formed by the combinations and permutations of a relatively small number of chemical elements. There are innumerable other examples in nature of form and structure which are generated from the combinations of physically as well as chemically different components.<br>\n <br>\n 1.2 Snowflakes exhibit great diversity of form, governed by certain physical, geometrical, and chemical constraints.<br>\n <br>\n The snowflake is a most graphic example in nature of the minimum inventory I maximum diversity principie. In fact, it may be considered an archetype of physicogeometric expression. Ali planar snow crystals are found to have star-like forms with six corners (or subsets thereof). More specifically, they have the symmetry of a regular hexagon. However, within this six-fold form, no two snowflakes have ever been known to be exactly alike. Figure [1.2] shows 37 different snowflakes (Bentley and Humphreys, 1962). The form ranges from very simple and delicate stellate structures through complex filigreelike configurations to bold and relatively massive hexagonal plates. Not only are they ali six-sided, but only certain angular relationships occur in these symmetrically branching structures. lt is interesting to note that each individual snowflake exh i bits a high degree. of differentiation within its own form. This variety of pattern which occurs across the face of each individual crystal further emphasizes the minimum inventory/maximum diversity principie. The molecular structure of the snowflake is the building system by which this infinite diversity is generated. This building system consists of Cl')rtain physical, geometrical, and chemical constraints (rubrics) which govern the form options. The variety of the snowflake results from a least-energy interaction of its \"kit of parts\" with the environmental conditions of temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and atmospheric pressure under which it is formed.<br>\n <br>\n xiii<br>\n <br>\n lntroduction<br>\n <br>\n Crystal structures, in general, demonstrate diversity of form as a function of the least-energy internai arrangements of their atomic arrays. In biological structures, the DNA molecule suggests a minimum inventory/maximum diversity principle-although a complex one, with less dependence on physicogeometric constraints than on biochemical interactions. Forms in nature are always generated by structures in nature, and a characteristic range of diversity and differentiation is exhibited within the combinatorial limits of a particular formative process. In the present work we are concerned primarily with these aspects of structure in nature which manifest themselves in terms of physicogeometric phenomena (built form), since architectural structure operates by definition in this realm. A large part of the form determinants of crystal structures can be characterized as physicogeometric phenomena. Because of this, the relàtionship of crystals to building structures is more apparent than is the case with biological structures.<br>\n <br>\n lt can be readily seen that the principie of closest packing is equivalent to that of triangulation, and it is well known that triangulated frameworks exhibit inherent geometric stabi lity. Such properties enable framework structures to be built without moment joints, insuring axially loaded members; and this in turn results in high strength-per-weight minimum-energy structures. Planar and domical structures have taken advantage of triangulation for a number of years; the first truly threedimensional triangulated structures were probably Alexander Graham Bell's tetrahedral kites and space frames. The principie of closest packing/triangulation is one of remarkable universality. lt operates independently of scale or materiais, with the same energetically conservative effect. Whether at the molecular levei, the cellular levei, or at the man-made structural levei, its inherent stability always establishes a condition of minimullil potential energy. ·<br>\n <br>\n An integral part of the concept of minimum inventory/maximum diversity systems is the principie of conservation of resources. The formative processes in natural structure are clíaracteristically governed by least-energy responses. Perhaps the simplest expression of this is found in the principie of closest packing, a principie which even in its most elementary form is common in both the animate and inanimate worlds.<br>\n <br>\n That nature creates forms and structures according to the requirements of minimum energy is perhaps the most pervasive theme throughout D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's beautiful work, On Growth and Form. Thompson describes~ how nature, as a response to the action of force, creates a great diversity of forms from an inventory of basic principies. \"In short, the form of an object is a diagram of forces; in this sense, at least, that from it we can judge of or deduce the forces that are acting or have acted upon it; in this strict and particular sense, it is a diagram.\" (Thompson 1:16). We canassume that in this creation of form, nature's responses to force action tend to fulfill the conditions of minimum energy. Form as a diagram of forces is an important governing idea in the application of the minimum inventory/maximum diversity principie to building system design. lf a building system can be considered analogous to a molecular structure which is highly responsive to varied actions of force, it may offer the real possibility of generating building forms responsive to the human needs and natural requirements of diversity, adaptation, change, and the conservative use of hatural resources. In arder to facilitate a design strategy I have attempted an elaboration on the concept of force. A force may be considered as any factor which may act from within or from without to determine any given form. The form of any structure is determined by the interaction of two fundamental classes offorces: (1) intrinsic forces, and (2) extrinsic forces. lntrinsic forces are those governing factors which are inherent in any particular structural system; that is, the internai properties of a system which govern its possible arrangements and its potential performance. In the case of ou r archetypal snow crystals, the intrinsic force system would be its molecular structure which governs the nature or character of its infinitely varied patterns.<br>\n <br>\n Closest packing is a structural arrangement of inherent geometric stability that finds expression in the three-dimensional arrangement of polyhedral cells in biological systems as well as in the dense arrangement of spherical atoms in the structure of certain metais. lf the centers of closest packed equal spheres are joined, a three-dimensional arrangement of equilateral triangles is formed. lf the centers of closest packed polyhedral cells in a biological structure are joined through shared faces, a triangulated configuration will also result.<br>\n <br>\n xiv<br>\n <br>\n Form as a Diagram of Forces<br>\n <br>\n lntroduction<br>\n <br>\n Extrinsic forces are those governing influences which are externai to any particular structural system. They are the inventory of factors, largely environmental, which give direction to the form options allowed by the inherent combinatorial or formgiving properties of a given structural system. The extrinsic forces in our snowflake example wol,Jid be those specific environmental factors of temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and atmospheric pressure which interact with the molecular structure to synthesize form. Ali forms in nature are determined by the interaction of intrinsic with extrinsic forces. The snowflake typifies ali crystalline orderings. The possible externai . shape options that a given crystal may take are controlled by the internai symmetry of the atomic arrangement; that is, by the system with which the atoms themselves are arranged. The particular local form of a given crystal is determined by the interaction of externai environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) with the inherent principies governing the atomic arrangements. A given crystalline substance may take a variety of shapes; but certain limits to form, usually expressed as angular relationships, are governed by the inherent form-giving properties (the intrinsic force system) of the atomic arrangement [1.3].<br>\n <br>\n The ínteraction of intrinsic and extrinsic forces to produce form in nature are relatively comprehensible for the case of inanimate crystals, as the interactions tend to be domínated by physícogeometric phenomena. The process is much more complex and elusive as one examines biological form and structure. The division between intrinsic and extrinsic forces is not always clear and tends to be hierarchical. That is, at one scale a force may be considered extrinsic, but in a larger context, the same force may become intrinsic. This hierarchical phenomenon exists for both inanimate and animate structures. For example, a given molecular structure may constitute an intrinsic force system that contrais the options of possible crystalline cell shapes when they are in association with other cells, and the environment formed by the contiguous cells is the extrinsic force that determines which particular option a cell shape may take. The interaction of the extrinsic environmental force with the intrinsic molecular force determines the shapes of the cells in an array. This array of cell shapes then becomes an intrinsic force system that contrais the possible shape options of a larger form that reflects still another levei of extrinsic force [1.4]. Each successive levei of structure is the environment (extrinsic force system) for the preceding levei (intrinsic force system). This process can apparently progress ad infinitum. In the creation of the man-made environment extrinsic forces can be considered the design goals-the various criteria, be they whimsical, philosophical, esthetic, or performance-oríented, that may be imposed upon the designed form. lntrinsic forces in the design of the man-made e'nvironment can be considered the \"stateof-the-art\" technologies and the limitations of their use governed by the levei of skill and perceptions available and by the dogma of habit and bias that may prevail.<br>\n <br>\n 1.3 Externai form dictated by the allowable packings of internai modular elements.<br>\n <br>\n xv<br>\n <br>\n lntroduction<br>\n <br>\n 1.4 A hierarchy of intrinsic and extrinsic forces. The hexagonal shape represents an extrinsic response at the lowest levei; at higher leveis of organization, the hexagonal cell can itself be viewed as an intrinsic determinant of the larger form.<br>\n <br>\n In the present design context, the intrinsic force systems avai lable do not appear to be capable of anything approaching an optimum response to the complexity of extrinsic forces now évident in the manmade environment. The minimum inventory/maximum diversity principieis an attempt to develop a design strategy which embodies an intrinsic force system capable of effective responses to the environmental circumstances which now prevail and will continue to prevail in the future. Such environmental circumstances suggest the following summary of the concept of extrinsic forces as it relates specifically to the design of bui lding systems. The influences which are externai to the inherent properties of a form-giving (building) system constitute a set of extrinsic forces andare the criteria for the creation of building form. These extrinsic forces include: (a) prevailing environmental conditions of temperature, wind, humidity, earth-sun geometry, and their variations;* (b) limitations of resources including energy and materiais; (c) topographical conditions; (d) geological conditions; (e) building function including the change of its use over time; (f) relationship to the community; and (g) emotional ambience. *For abri lliant discussion of the response of different building forms to the stresses of environmental variation and how to optimize form to minimize the need for supportive maintenance energy, see Knowles.<br>\n <br>\n xvi<br>\n <br>\n The anticipation of effective building form as a response to these extrinsic forces suggests the following summary of intrinsic forces: a given building system embodies a set of intrinsic forces which determines the inherent properties of the system. These inherent properties include the building system's ability to: (a) con- . form to arrangements of minimum potential energy, i.e., structural efficiency relative to use of materiais; (b) provi de diversity of form in order to respond (adapt) optimally to the actions of an array of extrinsic forces; (c) accommodate change in response to the inevitable long term variations of certain extrinsic forces; (d) define a minimum inventory of component types in order to simplify and economize the production and use of the system; (e) take advantage of materiais that are consistent with an optimum response to the actions of extrinsic forces and to the economical producti~n of the system's components; and (f) make use of production methods that allow components to be produced economically. Although the development of sophisticated means by which to analyze extrinsic forces relevant to building design is extremely important (see Knowles), our present concern is the development of a sophisticated and responsive intrinsic force system. Successful design solutions are not possible without the appropriate interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic forces. The field of environmental design has been preoccupied with considerations of design criteria (extrinsic forces) to the neg lect of the i nherent properties of systems (intrinsic forces) and their implications for creating adaptive form. The present work assumes that the ability to respond effectively to the actions and stresses of extrinsic forces has as a prerequisite an understanding of a theory of intrinsic forces, and that intrinsic force systems do not inherently follow from criteria derived from an analysis of extrinsic forces.<br>\n <br>\n lntroduction<br>\n <br>\n Any environment for human use organizes and distributes energy in various forms. Crystalline material, gases, and liquids are ali juxtaposed in a system which exists in three-dimensional space. lt matters little what a given spatial complex may look like, be it formally \"geometric\" or be it amorphously \"organic\"-its stnJcture is still a matter of physical and geometric relationships. lt must work in three-dimensional physical space. Structure in nature suggests that there must be some fundamental principies and laws, an intrinsic force system, which can form the basis for the design of minimum inventory/maximum diversity building systems. lt must be possible to understand the fundamental and comprehensive phenomena which govern the adaptive form-giving potential of modular systems in three-dimensional physical space. Since modularity implies order and order implies symmetry, the intelligibility of a theory of modular structure will depend on an understanding of the extent to which principies of symmetry govern modular order in three-dimensional space. In addition to an understanding of the general nature of modular structure, specific physical characteristics of particular modular arrangements must be evaluated with respect to their structural efficiency in terms of energy utilization.<br>\n <br>\n An lntegrative Morphology<br>\n <br>\n Whether they are atoms, spheres, cells, linear members, or surfaces, the components of a physical system have specific size, weight, and shape. The possible ways in which such physical components can fit together into alternative structures are governed by physicogeometrical laws of symmetry. Although such laws can be described mathematically by the abstract relationship of points and lines in space, our present concern calls for a morphológical approach in which the elements of modular structures are represented i.n terms of built form.<br>\n <br>\n I~<br>\n <br>\n Since our concern is a system from which useful building forms can be assembled, we must look at the fundamental principies governing spatial differentiation and enclosure in three dimensions. Any volume which encloses space or which differentiates two or more regions of space can be formed by a collection of surface modules, i.e., polygons. Since any polygon can be defined by a closed framework, i.e., a circuit of edges, any volume can be ;minimally described as a framework. For example, a cube is composed of six square faces, each of which can be defined by a four-sided trame. The entire cube can be defined by and assembled from twelve linear components or branches. I could go on to give innumerable examptes of both finite systems like the cube, or infinite systems like a packing of cubes, ali of which can be defined as some kind of modular framework or network. The requirement of providing for diversity of form suggests that a comprehensive inventory of orderly and fundamental spatial alternatives represented by both finite and infinite networks would be useful, particularly since the state-of-the-art building design approaches exhibit an intrinsic force system dominated by an orthogonal spatial bias.<br>\n <br>\n xvii<br>\n <br>\n There can be no doubt that cube oriented geometry is extremely important and relevant to architectural design; however, it has serious modular limitations with respect to the generation of diversity of form, and as a structural framework it has inferior strength-to-weight properties when compared to triangulated systems. The inclusion of orthogonal geometry as an element in a broader view of spatial relationships in three-dimensional structures, ratherthan as the dominant principie, is bound to increase the inventory of options. Even chi ldren of kindergarten age know that cubes can be packed together to fi li space. At this early age a fundamental spatial bias is imposed which is pervasive in Western culture. Virtually ali examples of architecture consisting of aggregates of volumetric units, i.e., rooms, demonstrate this bias. lt is fairly rare that we actually see true cubes, but how many buildings have been built in which rooms are not defined or enclosed by four vertical and two horizontal surfaces, ali disposed at 90° to one another? Most of our cities utilize some form of rectangular grid for the plan of their streets. Cartesian coordinates are a boon to mensuration, it is true, but does it follow (particularly in the age of the computer, when calculations in nonorthogonal coordinates take hardly more time than those in rectangular coordinates) that designers must constrain their forms to the shape of the coordinates upon which they are erected? As we shall see, reliance upon the 90° angle as a basis for organizing space imposes extremely limited means to reach our goal of maximum diversity and minimum inventory. A cursory observation of natural structures shows that cubes rarely occur. This alone suggests that a careful st~dy of other alternatives is advisable. As an inventory of form options is assembled consisting of simple finite polyhedra, through polyhedral symmetrical spacefilling systems, to a broader class of infinite periodic three-dimensional networks, and beyond, it becomes increasing ly clea,r that the fui fi llment of the minimum inventory/maximum diversity principie depends upon the possibility of understanding the interrelatedness of an inventory of alternatives.<br>\n <br>\n lntroduction<br>\n <br>\n The possible common relationship among such alternatives has been explored and developed into an integrative morphological strategy. lt is an integrative strategy because it enables entire inventaries of systems to be generated as combinations and permutations of common sets of elements, and it is a morphological strategy because it is primarily a concrete physical embodiment of the inherent principies of symmetry and geometry which govern modular order in three-dimensional space rather than an abstract mathematical description of such principies. With this morphological approach, threedimensional ordering principies in nature can be understood in a direct empirical and sensorially apprehended way. As morphological embodiments of inherent modular principies, such a strategy not only constitutes intrinsic force systems, but can be both physical model systems and architectural building systems as well. Rather than attempt to set up \"architectural\" criteria for the discovery of such new spatial possibilities, it is far more useful to establish as our goal a knowledge of ali the possibilities for the orderly subdivision, modulation, structuring, and enclosing of space. We have to be prepared to pursue a course of study which may, at times, seem remote indeeél from the creation of improved environments for human use. Yet in the end this path will prove to have been the best, for conclusions drawn from a partial study of space or from a study of space guided by popular experience or assumed technical and engineering limitations cannot uncover fundamental and radical improvements.<br>\n <br>\n The Platonic Solids. Triangulation and Geometric Stability<br>\n <br>\n 1 as<br>\n <br>\n Geometry<br>\n <br>\n Plato was apparently the first person to attempt a geometrical description of structure in nature. He also explored the possibility of developing an inventory of basic geometric shapes (in this case, right triangles) which could be recombined to form the five regular polyhedra* [1.1 ]. Plato's Timaeus contains a detailed account for constructing four of the regular solids from two types of triang les, identifying the four solids with the four elements: the tetrahedron represented fire; the cube, earth; the octahedron, ai r; and the icosahedron, water. Apparently it did not disturb Plato that the pentagonal dodecahedron could not be formed with his basic triangles. The dodecahedron became for him the shape which envelops the entire universe. These five regular polyhedra became known as the Platonic solids (Benfy and Fikes 1966; Burke 1966). The five Platonic solids are the only convex polyhedra that are bounded by identical regular polygonal faces in which ali vertices are equivalent.<br>\n <br>\n Structure<br>\n <br>\n The triangle is the only polygon that is stable (rigid) by virtue of its geometry. This can be readi ly demonstrated by the construction of a triangular frame joined at its vertices with hingeable connectors. *Apolygon is a finite connected set of line<br>\n <br>\n segments which are joined to each other at their ends such that a closed circuit is formed consisting of edges (sides) and corners (vertices). lf the vertices are ali coplanar a plane polygon is formed; if not, a skew polygon is formed. A polygon is equilateral if its sides are ali equal, and equiangular if the interior angles formed at each vertex are ali equal. A plane polygon is considered regular if it is both equilateral and equiangular. A polyhedron is a volume bounded by plane surfaces. lt may be considered a finite connected set of plane polygons forming a closed volumetric figure, such that each si de of every polygon is shared with one other polygon, and that the sides of these polygons intersect at their ends in groups of three or more to form the vertices of the polyhedron. The polygons are the faces and their sides the edges of a polyhedron. A polyhedron is regular if its faces are identical (congruent) regular polygons and equal, and ali of its vertices are equivalent, i.e., ali its vertices are surrounded alike.<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n Such a triangular frame remains rigid-in contrast to polygons of more than three sides, any of which will readily collapse when assembled with hinged joints. Of the Platonic polyhedra only the tetrahedra, octahedra, and icosahedra are composed of triangles, and are, therefore, the only figures of the five that are stable by virtue of their geometry. Again, if we construct ali five figures with struts as edges joined at their vertices by hingeable connectors, we see that the cu be and dodecahedra collapse, while the other three figures remain rigid. This demonstration has far-reaching significance for the study of structure: triangulation imparts strength to structures even before the physics of materiais is taken into account-it provides a head start to, and a guarantee of, structural rigidity. Although Plato's insights anticipated the concept of modular structures bui lt up from elementary constituent parts, his choices in the pairing of polyhedra with the four basic elements suggests that he may not h ave been aware of the physical implications of triangulation. lt is curious that he would have the unstable cube representing the earth, and the stable octahedron representing air. In any case, the inherent stability of triangulated polyhedra was a principie that hedid not elucidate. · Plato's triang les represent an attempt to establish a fundamental morphological system which could account for the variety of forms in nature. lt was, albeit primitive, a minimum inventory I maximum diversity system, perhaps the first vision of a geometrically based intrinsic force system. 1.1 The regular polyhedra of Plato (the \"Piatonic solids\"): tetrahedron (a), octahedron (b), hexahedron (c), icosahedron (d), ançJ dodecahedron (e).<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n c<br>\n <br>\n d<br>\n <br>\n e<br>\n <br>\n Triangulation and Closest Packing<br>\n <br>\n The repeated or iterated pattern of triangles is a pervasive geometrical arrangement in the physical world. lt is related to c/osest packing and can range in scale from structures easily seen with the unaided eye, e.g., the bee's honeycomb, to those requiring powerful magnification, e.g., the association of cells in tissues or closest packed atoms in certain crystals. lf circles are tightly packed, as densely as possible, and their centers joined, triangles are formed. When the centers of packed hexagons are joi ned, an array of triangles also results [i .2].<br>\n <br>\n C!osest Packing of Circ!es<br>\n <br>\n C!osest Packing of Hexagons<br>\n <br>\n 1.3 Figures formed by closest packed equal spheres.<br>\n <br>\n ~t::<br>\n <br>\n b. Regular Hexagon<br>\n <br>\n lf six equal spheres are tightly packed, an octahedron is formed [i.3d]. lf eight spheres are positioned so as to form the corners of a cube, an unstable condition is created. That isto say, when the sphere centers are joined in this configuration squares are formed, which have no geometrical stability. lt takes a minimum of i 4 c losest packed spheres to form a stable cube [i .3e]. Connecting ali centers here, of course, makes evident the diagonal bracing across the cube's six faces.<br>\n <br>\n &amp;lJ c. Tetrahedron<br>\n <br>\n ®<br>\n <br>\n e. Cube<br>\n <br>\n Considera stacking of cylinders of equal diameter. As cylinders are stacked upon each other, their natural tendency isto arrange themselves in a triangular order. The end view of such an arrangement looks like the packing of equal circles. This is simply the arrangement which requires the least effort to maintain-it is a minimum-energy configuration. In any case where we analyze the particular physical forces-of surface tension, gravitation, or whatever-that lead to a stable state of some physical system, we find triangulated solutions (i.e., triangulated arrangements) to be associated with the minimum-energy state, or, what is often the same thing, the minimum-resource state.<br>\n <br>\n d. Octahedron<br>\n <br>\n J<br>\n <br>\n *See Loeb ( 1966b) for another look at the same question.<br>\n <br>\n In a three-dimensional array of closest packed (as densely as possible) equal spheres, each sphere is exactly surrounded by twelve others. The centers of the outer spheres are the i 2 vertices of a polyhedron known as the cuboctahedron [i .3a]. In the plane, six spheres always surround a seventh, forming a regular hexagon [i .3b]. lf three spheres are packed together in a plane as tightly as possible and their centers joined, an equi lateral triang Ie is formed. lf a fourth sphere is placed upon the group of three spheres, the four vertices of the regular tetrahedron are established [i .3c].<br>\n <br>\n 1.2 Triangulation of two-dimensional closest packed arrays.<br>\n <br>\n a Cuboctahedron<br>\n <br>\n When packing many circles together, it is most economical (more circles can be placed in a given area) to impose \"triangular\" packing. In the limit of very many circles, ali of a common size, approximately 7% more circles may be placed in a g iven are a of plane su rface if the i r centers can be connected to form equilateral triang les rather than squares [i .4]*<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n Triangulation and Closest Packing<br>\n <br>\n 1.4 Comparison of square and triangular packings of equal c i reles in a given area.<br>\n <br>\n Partitioning and Tessellation. Networks and Dual Networks<br>\n <br>\n lt is well known that, of ali plane figures, the circle encloses the greatest area of surface for a given circumference, oralternatively, encloses a given area with the smallest circumference. Likewise, of any three-dimensional shape the sphere matches the greatest volume to the least surface area. Do the circle and the sphere remain the most economical possibilities when we are concerned with the manycelled partitioning of space? Considerthe partitioning formed by closest packed circles: although each circle by itself is very economical (i.e., it encloses rnaximum area for its given perimeter) srnall concave tri ang les are formed between circles. Now, concave triangles match the least area with the greatest circumference. Consequently we can say that, considering the entire plane, circle packing is not the most economical system. However, let us allow the circles to change their shape sue h that they fi li up the concave triang les, forming hexagons [1.5]. This becomes the most economical rnethod for partitioning a surface into equal units of area. lt is worth reiterating what is here meant by \"economical partitioning.\" That partitioning is economical which divides up a space into cells of maximum size for a given amount of wall material. In the example just discussed, we have seen how simple geometrical reasoning has led us to a hexagonal tessellation of the plane in which there is no \"dead\" space between cells; ali is either enclosed, usable space or wall. Furthermore, though the foregoing demonstration is not to be considered a rigorous proof, it suggests that our hexagonal cells match minimum structure (the overall length of the walls) to maximum usable area.<br>\n <br>\n In addition to being the most economical partitioning of the plane, hexagonal tessellation is also the simplest. That is, a given plane surface cannot be continuously divided without at least three edges meeting at each point. lf only two edges meet ata point the plane cannot be continuously divided. lt has been shown (Courant and Robbins, pp. 354-361) that if three points are to be interconnected by means of a network whose total length is to be a minimum, they must be joined by three line segments meeting at an intermediate point at 120° angles, with the condition that in the triangle defined by the three points there are no ang les greater than 120 degrees. Furthermore, connecting an arbitrary number of random points in the plane in such a way as to minimize the total distance between the points results in a series of line segments meeting in threes at 120° angles within the area defined by the point array [1.6]. The packing of hexagons reveals the fundamental relationship of the triangular order of close packed circles with the requirements of minimal partitioning. Since the general sense of the closest packing of circles is that of associated finite units, i.e., a packing of circular disks or cylinders, and since it is not comprised of straight line-segments joined at vertices, it is usually not considered a network. On the other hand, a packing of hexagons may readily be considered a network since a network can be considered to be a connected set of straight line segments (edges) joined to each other at their ends to form vertices, such that two-dimensional or three-dimensional space is subdivided or partitioned. From any network we can construct a reciproca! or dual network. A dual network may be constructed on a surface by joining the center of each polygonal cell in a given network with the centers of ali of its neighboring cells through their common edges. In the case of the hexagon system, the reciproca! network is an array of triangles [1.2]. When the hexagons are ali exactly regular, the triangular network will be composed entirely of regular triang les meeting in groups of six at each vertex. Such a network which is equilateral, equiangular, and in which ali vertices are equal, may be considered a regular network.<br>\n <br>\n 1.5 Changing closest packed circles into closest packed hexagons.<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n Geometry as Structure<br>\n <br>\n Sphere packings represent the threedimensional generalization of circle packings in the plane. The triangular order of sphere packings gives ri se to a threedimensional network of equi lateral triangles forming the faces of tetrahedra and octahedra in a space filling array.* ls there a three-dimensional analog to the hexagon packing? ls there a polyhedron which will uniformly partition threedimensional space with less total surface area per unit of enclosed volume than any other shape? The answer is affirmative but is more subtle than that for the twodimensional case. *\"Space filling\" means the combining of like or complementary bodies in a three-dimensional packing continuously repeated, in sue h a way that there is no unoccupied space. 1.6 A \"minimum-length\" connection of random points in a plane.<br>\n <br>\n Filling the Voids: The Kelvin Figure<br>\n <br>\n Justas the closest packed circles left concave spaces between them, so does an array of closest packed spheres. As we might suspect, these concave shapes have high surface area per unit volume and consequently depreciate the minimalsurface advantage of the spheres. If the spheres are swol.len to fi li in these concave voids, a polyhedron results with 12 identical rhombic faces. lt is known as the rhombic dodecahedron [1.7a].<br>\n <br>\n 1. 7 Rhombic dodecahedron (a), truncated octahedron (b), and lhe Kelvin minimal tetrakaidecahedron (c).<br>\n <br>\n Since in an array of closest packed spheres, each sphere is alike surrounded by 12 others, it is not so surprising that this polyhedron would have exactly 12 faces. A dual network for space filling polyhedra may be found by constructing edges which join the centers of every polyhedron in the space filling array with the centers of ali its neighboring polyhedra which share common faces. Doing this we would find that the network which is dual to the space filling array of rhombic dodecahedra is the space filling array of tetrahedra and octahedra in which 12 edges meet at the vertices that fali at the centers of the original rhombic dodecahedra.<br>\n <br>\n a<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n Can we say that the rhombic dodecahedron is the shape with the least surface area per unit of volume that will uniformly partition space? ls it the three-dimensional generalization of the hexagon? The answer is no, except in some special circumstances. We must look further. Lord Kelvin (1887) showed that there is one shape made up of plane surfaces that will uniformly partition space with less surface area than the rhombic dodecahedron. This shape is called thetruncated octahedron, a polyhedron bounded by six square faces and eight regular hexagonal faces, a total of 14 fac'es. The standard plane faced version of this shape [1.7b] has approximately 1% less surface area for a given volume than the rhombic dodecahedron. Kelvin also proposed a \"minimal tetrakaidecahedron\"* [1.7c], in which a very slight saddle curvature is given to the hexagon faces of the truncated ootahedron; the result is approximately O. 103% less surface for a given volume than for the truncated octahedron (Lifshitz).<br>\n <br>\n c<br>\n <br>\n *Tetrakaidecahedron means fourteen-hedra: a polyhedron with 14 faces. Tetra = four and deca = ten. Tetrakaideca =letra plus (kai) deca = fourteen.<br>\n <br>\n 5<br>\n <br>\n Filling the Voids: The Kelvin Figure<br>\n <br>\n The closest packing of truncated octahedra can be considered to be a denser packing than that of the rhombic dodecahedron because in a space filling array each truncated octahedron is surrounded by 14 others corresponding to its 14 faces, while the rhombic dodecahedron is surrounded by only 12 like cells. Space filling truncated octahedra give rise to a dual network consisting of congruent isosceles-triang le-faced tetrahedra known as tetragonal disphenoids (Coxeter 1963). This network consists of edges of two different lengths, 14 meeting at each vertex (in the ratio of 1:3). Like the packing of tetrahedra and octahedra, this system constitutes a very efficient, fully triangulated structural framework. Space filling truncated octahedra is thus evidently a minimum-energy system. As such, it must be considered to be the generalization to three dimensions of the hexagon. Nevertheless, we find that the rhombic dodecahedron, as well as the truncated octahedron, appears as the basis of the solution to certain minimal problems in nature; and thus we are hard put to identify one or the other as the most general solution. The rhombic dodecahedron and the truncated octahedron exhibit similar geometric characteristics when they are viewed in cellular arrays. VVith both systems, there are always three shared faces (partitions) meeting on an edge. For the rhombic dodecahedron these shared faces meet at ang les of 120°, whi Ie for the truncated octahedron they meet at 125°16', 109°28', and 125°16'. In space filling array, the rhombic dodecahedron has two classes of vertices: four edges meeting at a vertex at 109°28' ang les and eight edges meeting ata vertex at ang les of 70°32', in the ratio of two 4-connected vertices for every 8-connected vertex.* The space filling truncated octahedron has only one type of vertex, which is 4-connected, with alternating angles of 90° and 120°. Looking at the individual polyhedra, we find that the rhombic dodecahedron has eight 3-connected vertices (that isto say, eight with three edges surrounding each vertex) and six 4-connected vertices, a total of 14, and the truncated octahedron has 24 3-connected vertices. *In this book, an \"n-connected vertex\" will be taken to be one at which n edges meet.<br>\n <br>\n Many-Celled Soap Bubble Arrays Where equal tensions exist in ali the faces of a cellular array, the array equilibrates into an arrangement in which ali shared faces meet at ang les of 120° and ali vertices are joined alike by four edges meeting at angles of 109°28'. This is exhibited in the random array of soap bubbles shown in [1.8].* In soap-film behavior, nature has provided us with a most elegant demonstration of minimal principies. When studying a soap-film array, such as that shown in [1.8], we quickly note that neither pure rhombic dodecahedra nor pure truncated octahedra appear. The Kelvin minimal tetrakaidecahedron has been proposed as the archetypal soap-bubble cell. With the minimal tetrakaidecahedron Kelvin enlarged the class of truncated octahedra to include those whose faces are saddleshaped hexagons bounded by plane ares. The square faces of the truncated octahedra remain plane, but are necessarily also bounded by the same are edges. This transforms the truncated octahedron to the minimal tetrakaidecahedron and satisfies the requirement in space filling array that three interfaces meet on a ccmmon edge at 120° ang les and that four face edges meet at a common point at 109°28' ángles. The minimal tetrakaidecahedron, like the truncated octahedron, has a fully triangulated dual network (tetragonal disphenoidal network).<br>\n <br>\n *Wilh soap bubble arrays of two differenl volumes, Malzke foúnd an average of 13.53 faces and agai n observed lhal lhe majorily of face-s were penlagons. Some rare examples of lhe Kelvin figure were reported for leaf lissues by Macior and Malzke.<br>\n <br>\n Although the Kelvin tetrakaidecahedron is the mathematically ideal minimal-energy equivolume cell shape, it rarely occurs in nature, for the simple reason that nature rarely partitions equally. The few known cases where it has been observed shows it in fairly distorted form. Matzke (1946) conducted experiments to create equivolume soap bubble arrays. He was unable to actually form the Kelvin minimal tetrakaidecahedron, but in a sample of 600 bubbles was able to show that, as an average, the polyhedra had 13.70 faces, very close to the 14. He also observed that a majority of the faces that appeared were pentagons. lt is interesting to note that the tetrakaidecahedron has an average of 5.14 edges per face. Figure [1.9] shows camera Iuci da drawings made from bubble froths in Matzke's experiments. The predominance of five-sided faces is evident, as is the recourse to 3-connected vertices to the exclusion of ali others.<br>\n <br>\n 1.8 Soap bubbles.<br>\n <br>\n 1.9 Camera-lucida drawings of soap bubble cells (Malzke).

The Law of Closest Packing and Triangulation. For any soap bubble array, either random or uniform, at least we can say that the cells will be organized according to a triangular order. More specifically, in a two-dimensional froth, cells meet in threes around each vertex and consequently always define triangles, and in a threedimensional soap froth, the cells meet in fours around each vertex and always define tetrahedra. In soap froth there is never any exception to this rule. A single soap bubble floating freely in space is spherical. This is the state of minimum potential energy. When in association with other cells, it becomes more economical for the sphere to change into a polyhedron. Let us now, following Thompson, consider the conjoining of bubbles that rest upon a plane surface. A single bubble is a simpie hemisphere [UOa]. When two bubbles of equal volume are combined they join forming a vertical planar interface between them [ 1.1 Ob ]. When viewed from above, the spherical surfaces and the interface form two vertices of three edges each where they contact the horizontal plane upon which they rest. Each of the two vertices is surrounded alike by one straight edge and two are edges. The surface areas of the two hemispheres are a minimum when the tangents of these are edges meet th~ straight edge such that they are ali surrounded by 120° angles. lf there is a difference in the size of two bubbles they will meet so that they still satisfy the 120° angle requirement; in such a case, therefore, ali three edges at each vertex will be curved.<br>\n <br>\n ''<br>\n <br>\n We may continue adding hemispherical bubbles to our structure, and not once will an intersect.ion appear in which there are other than three edges meeting ata point [ U Of-h]. lf the bubbles are ali of approximately equal volume ali the polygonal circuits that are formed will be very close in shape to hexagons, except those at the periphery of the array. lf there are great differences in the sizes of adjacent bubbles in a random array, shapes other than hexagons will appear: pentagons, heptagons, even octagons or more multisided circuits [1.11]. Nevertheless, there will still be no exception to the rule of three edges meeting ata point, and in sufficiently large arrays the shapes will tend to average out to ones of six sides. In ali cases, the dual network will be triangular, although not necessarily equilateral. In three-dimensional arrays of bubbles the rule appears to change to the extent that there are always four edges meeting at each vertex at ang les of 109°28'. In actuality, the view of three edges meeting ata point at 120° is simply aplan (cross sectional) view of the three partition faces meeting on a common edge at 120° angles.* *This is easily demonstrated with a wire frame tetrahedron dipped in soap. (See Thompson 11:497.)<br>\n <br>\n b.<br>\n <br>\n Q<br>\n <br>\n 8<br>\n <br>\n c.@<br>\n <br>\n d0 ffi e.<br>\n <br>\n f@<br>\n <br>\n g.w h@ 1.1 O Simple planar combinations of hemispherical soap bubbles viewed from above. The \"square\" array (e) is unstable. 1.11 Triangulation of a planar array of random bubbles viewed from above.<br>\n <br>\n lf three hemispherical bubbles are combined, it is found that they arrange themselves with three planar interfaces ali meeti ng at 120° ang les [ 1.1 Oc]. The three edges meeting at each point are preserved. When four hemispherical bubbles combine, they also only create intersections in which three edges meet ata point [ 1.1 Od]. lt is impossible to form a group of four hemispherical bubbles in such a way that they surround a common point in the manner shown in [ 1.1 Oe]. Sue h a \"square\" array is an unstable condition, for the surface areais not ata minimum in this arrangement. The intersection created by four cells on a surface [1.10d] is called the polar furrow (Thompson 11:4S7). This furrow, as we shall see, serves as a useful clue for the identification of closest packing in a variety of contexts.<br>\n <br>\n 7<br>\n <br>\n a.<br>\n <br>\n Simple Bubble Arrays<br>\n <br>\n A Law of Closest Packing and Triangulation can be proposed: when compactarrays of volumetric (morphological) units (bubbles, cells, atoms, etc.) are formed by any externai or internai attractive forces, they tend to have the greatest possible numbers of neighboring units while equalizing as nearly as possible the distances between their centers. The network which joins the centers of ali nearest neighbors is always triangulated (usually in multi pies of tetrahedra) and tends towards uniform edge lengths. Also, when such volumetric units consist (momentarily or permanently) of relatively fluid interfaces they tend to take the shape of polyhedra cells of minimum surface area relative to their volumes with faces meeti ng edges at ang les of 120° and edges meeting vertices at angles of 109°28'. These angles are imposed by the forces of surface tension and satisfy the conditions of minimum potential energy.* With its dual network of equilateral triangles, the rhombic-dodecahedral packing might be taken to be the minimum-energy system for a bubble array insofar as the distances between rhombic dodecahedron centers are ali exactly the same. This arrangement, equivalent to the twelve-around-one packing of closest packed spheres, might seem to be the most compact arrang~ment. But we have seen that the truncated octahedron packs with 14 neighbors, and, as such, is a denser or more compact arrangement than the sphere or rhombic-dodecahedral packing. *Loeb, inspired by Laves and Fuller, has proposed a similar idea for the structure of crystals: \"Crystal structures tend to assume canfiguratians in which a maximum number of identical atoms or ians are equidistant from each other; if more than a single type of atam or ian are present, then each atam or ion tends to be equidistant from as many as possible of each type of atam or ian. lt is a simple extension of the fact that a stable. system of three identical interacting particles will arrange itself in an equilateral triangle, that four such partieles will occupy the corners of a regular tetrahedron, etc.\" (Laeb 1967b).<br>\n <br>\n 8<br>\n <br>\n The dual network of the truncated octahedron consists of edges which differ in length by 15%. A homogeneous array of identical tetragonal disphenoids results. The tetrahedron is the simplest of ali possi ble polyhedra and is the strongest per unit of invested energy. The reciproca! net of the rhombic-dodecahedral array contains both tetrahedra and octahedra. This reflects the fact that both 4-connected and 8-connected vertices appear in the rhombic-dodecahedral array. An octahedron, although a highly efficient structure, may be considered to be somewhat less strong than a tetrahedron-even one that is slightly distorted, as in the case of the isosceles-faced tetragonal disphenoid. A simple explanation for the rare occurrence of Kelvin's ideal minimal tetrakaidecahedron might be that nature seeks a compromise solution which tends to have the higher density of packing of truncated-octahedra along with the uniform distances of the rhombic-dodecahedral packing. lt may be that if some means could be found to measure the distances between the centers of the adjacent equivolume bubbles of Matzke's study, it would be found that these distances differed by less than 15%, and tended to approach the ideal of a uniform distance between cells. The average of 13.70 faces that Matzke observed may constitute a compromise between maximum density and minimum difference in center-to-center distances. This may provide even less total surface area per unit of volume than does the Kelvin figure. Although it would be difficult to verify, such a hypothesis suggests that an efficient physical construct does not always conform to an ideal mathematical solution. In the study of three-dimensional physical structure, we see that nature frequently utilizes apparent distortions of ideal mathematical forms because the distortions are more economical from an energy standpoint.<br>\n <br>\n Geometry as Structure<br>\n <br>\n Closest Packed Unequal Spheres. Coordination Polyhedra and Polyhedral Domains Frank and Kasper (1958, 1959) have described the structures of complex metal alloys in terms of the packi ng of spheres in which the allowance of small variations of sphere diameters permits denser packings than the characteristic twelvearound-one packing of equal spheres. Such packings are not homogeneous but combine, for different alloys, in various combinations of 12, 14, 15, and 16 spheres packed around any given sphere. The networks that define the centers of these sphere packing structures consist exclusive/y of space filling arrangements of tetrahedra. They are not ali regular but differences in edge lengths are minimized as in the case of the more uniform tetragonal-disphenoidal packing. The number of spheres surrounding any given sphere is called the coordination (or coordination number) Z. lf in these sphere packings with coordinations of 12, 14, 15, or 16, the spheres are \"expanded\" to fill a[l the unoccupied space, polyhedra result with 12, 14, 15, and 16 faces, respectively. Such polyhedra are known as coordination polyhedra. Any given sphere packing will have a corresponding set of space filling coordination polyhedra. The dual network to any such space filling system will correspond exactly to the network derived from connecting the centers of spheres in the closest packed array represented by the space filling array of coordination polyhedra. Since both of these networks are equivalent, the number of edges meeting at each vertex will exactly correspond to the coordination number of the sphere or polyhedron representing said vertex. Therefore the number of edges meeting ata given vertex is also known as the vertex coordination Z.<br>\n <br>\n Since the coordination polyhedron represents the environment, or discrete region of space, associated with a given sphere in a closest packed array, or associated with a given vertex of a connected network, such a polyhedron may also be called the domain (or polyhedral domain) of the sphere, or likewise the domain (or polyhedral domain) of the vertex. In the case of the domain of the vertex, the polyhedral domain will have the same number of faces as there are edges joining the vertex found at its center. The network formed by the space fi li i ng array of such polyhedral domains is exactly reciproca! to the network connecting the vertices which it represents. For example, the rhombic dodecahedron is both the coordination polyhedron and the poly- · hedral domain for closest packed equal spheres, and for the network generated by the space filling of tetrahedra and octahedra. The network generated by the space filling array of rhombic dodecahedra is reciproca! to that of the space fillingof tetrahedra and octahedra. Since there are 12 spheres around every sphere in the closest packed array, 12 faces on the rhombic dodecahedron, and 12 edges meeting at each vertex in the network of space filling tetrahedra and octahedra, the coordination number for the sphere, the domain, and network is 12. The reader is reminded that \"connected\" also refers to the number of edges meeting at a vertex.<br>\n <br>\n The coordination polyhedra corresponding to the sphere packings of Z = 12, 14, 15, and 16 are bounded by pentagons and hexagons and their vertices are ali 3-connected. They are respectively a dodecahedron boúnded by 12 pentagons, a tetrakaidecahedron bounded by two hexagons and 12 pentagons, a pentakaidecahedron bounded by three hexagons and 12 pentagons, and an hexakaidecahedron bounded by four hexagons and 12 pentagons [ 1.12]. Although Frank and Kasper do not discuss these polyhedra intheir articles, they are described in another context by K. W. Allen. We will also take them up in some detai I Iater in this book. Owing to the predominance of pentagons, the 4-connected networks formed by various packing combinations of these four polyhedra have a remarkable resemblance to soap-bubble arrays, which, as we have already noted, also exhibit an overwhelming number of pentagons. lf slight warpage of the faces is permitted, ali four of the polyhedra just described can be constructed so that in any space filling array ali vertices are not only 4-connected but are also equally surrounded by 109°28' ang les. Also, the partitioning faces will then meet on common edges in groups ofthree at 120° angles. In the 28 different actual and hypothetical structures classified by Frank and Kasper, it is shown that the average coordination is 13.35, remarkably close to the 13.53 average number of faces of Matzke's unequal soap bubbles, and to his 13.70 average number of faces for equivolume bubbles. These complex alloy structures studied by Frank and Kasper seem to follow the law ofclosest packing and triangulation. * *Bernal (1959) has proposed a random triangulated configuration for the molecular structure of liquids which, although not necessarily describable as adense arrangement of spheres, consists of space filling tetrahedra in which the distance between neighboring atoms tends toward a minimum. Bernal's approach shows definite similarities to those others discussed here.<br>\n <br>\n 1.12 Coordination polyhedra corresponding to sphere packings of Z = 12, dodecahedron (a); 14, tetrakaidecahedron (b); 15, pentakaidecahedron (c); and 16, hexakaidecahedron (d).<br>\n <br>\n 9<br>\n <br>\n The Soap-Bubble Array as Archetype<br>\n <br>\n The Soap-Bubble Array as Archetype A remarkable series of papers by Lewis, Marvin, and Matzke has discussed soap bubbles, compression of lead shot, the cells of various plants, and human fat cells. A generally consistent behavior is exhibited in these diverse realms. The forms of the systems are manifestations of the least-energy principie. Ali of the systems tend to conform to the law of closest packing and triangulation, although there are many other forces at work, particularly in biological systems where growth rates an,d sequences contrai rnorphological dévelopment. Smith compared soap-filmfroth behavior to the microstructure of metais and their grain shapes. (Smith 1948, 1952, 1953, W. M. Williams and Smith 1952). In \"The Shape of Things\" Smith says, \"lt seems at first astonishing that the cells of things as different as a metal and a soap froth can be almost indistinguishable in shape, but this is easily understood when it is realized that the interfaces between crystals are themselves essentially liquid like. The atoms in the boundary between two crystal grains are subjected to the opposing fields of both lattices. Since both cannot be satisfied simultaneously, a layer of atoms (probably not more than three or four atam diameters thick) is unable to crystallize. This fluid interface, which must be continuous, has associated with it a high surface tension, which makes it tend to shrink in exactly the same way as a soap film. Only a crystal growing freely without contact with others can have the highly symmetrical polyhedral shape that is usually thought to typify a crystal.\" Soap bubble packing, then, can be taken as the mode! or type of ali systemsbiological, physical, chemical-in which there is an economical association of cellular modules. And, at this point we may conclude that triangulation and closest packing are truly equivalent and that closest packing is at the heart of those principies that operate regardless of scale.<br>\n <br>\n Hexagons, Hierarchies, and Scale lndependence<br>\n <br>\n 2 Closest Packing<br>\n <br>\n Perhaps the most familiar example of closest packing, and certainly the most sublime, is the honeycomb of the bee [2.1]. This system, in plan one of regular hexagons, contains the greatest amount of honey with the least amount of beeswax (Toth 1964a), and is the structure which requires the least energy for the bees to construct.<br>\n <br>\n in Nature<br>\n <br>\n 2.1 Bees' honeycomb.<br>\n <br>\n 2.2 Honeycomb cell structure.<br>\n <br>\n The bee's cell appears to be a simple hexagonal prism; however, because the honeycomb consists of two sets of contiguous cells, positioned back to back, it takes on a more complicated form. The back-to-back cells are staggered in such a way that the centers of the set of cells on one side are positioned exactly over half of the three-rayed intersections of cell walls of the set of cells on the other side. This can be seen by looking at [2.2] with care. This arrangement corresponds to a packing of two layers of rhombic dodecahedra (or of two layers of closest packed spheres). The bees' cell is simply a rhombic dodecahedron with one end opened up to form a flat hexagon, and as such it is a 10-faced polyhedron bounded by three rhomboidal faces from the rhombic dodecahedron which form the \"bottom\" of the cell, six trapezoidal faces which form the six sides of the cell, and one hexagonal face which is the cell opening [2.3]. * The order manifest in the structure of bees' or wasps' nests appears, though perhaps in lesser degree, throughout biological morphology, and we find it to be common in crystal structure. The very ubiquitousness of such energy-efficient solutions is important, because the development of a general morphological system rests on the possibi'lity of discovering fundamental relationships among the broadest range of possible structures. As we examine various natural structures and the reasons for them, we wi li be constantly reminded that closest packing is simply a reflection of nature's tendency to coordinate extrinsic and intrinsic forces in the most energy-economic way. *For a detailed discussion of the structure and formation of the honeycomb, see Thompson li: 525. 2.3 Single honeycomb cell, showing rhombic dodecahedron within.<br>\n <br>\n 10<br>\n <br>\n We perceive the possibility of ~ierarchic structure when we realize that closest packing is independent of absolute specific size. A large number of naturally occurring substances and systemsorganic, inorganic, animate, or inanimate-will prove to be closest packed /fÍen viewed at the appropriate levei of , magnification. But, what is more important, within the same substance similar packings or structures (hierarchies) wi li appear at grossly different scales. In many instances, a closest packed microstructure will determine the options that a closest packed macrostructure may take. We can think again of intrinsic and extrinsic forces, in which one force may become the other as we pass through different hierarchies of scale. Natural structures are (for the most part) three-dimensional, while photographs and compilations of them, as in this book, are usually 1two-dimensional representations, such as in the cross sectional views of a cellular structure. These \"two-dimensional samples\" of three-dimensional structures tend to be dominated by three-rayed vertices, which, as was pointed out in Chapter 1, are often cróss-sectional representations of three partition faces meeting on a common edge at equal angles of 120°. The reader is also reminded that in three dimensions the condition of three faces meeting on a common edge at 120° is a consequence of four edges meeting at a common vertex at 109°28'.<br>\n <br>\n 11<br>\n <br>\n Weibel describes a schematic model of the arrangement of alveo! i around the alveolar duct of the human lung [2.4]. This structure calls to mind a hexagonal honeycomb wrapped around a cylindrical surface with hexagonal openings facing inward. This alveolar system exhibits a hierarchical structure; the cell walls of the alveo! i are composed of very fine capillary networks which are also hexagonally structured. A schematic sketch of this capillary network [2.5] structure shows the juncture of three cell walls. The continuity of the three-rayed hexagonal network of the capillary structure is maintained at this intersection of three cell-wall surfaces. 2.4 Alveo Ii in the human lung (Weibel). 2.5 Three-rayed, hexagonal capillary network of alveoli (Weibel).<br>\n <br>\n Hexagons, Hierarchies<br>\n <br>\n Differential Growth, Edge Effects, and Other lnteractions<br>\n <br>\n The cracking and drying of mud also proceeds in a \"hexagonal\" manner, complete with polar furrows [2. 7].<br>\n <br>\n Although the basis of various twodimensional networks is the hexagonal cell, in biological systems particularly, we must take into account growth sequences, sequential solidification of various parts, and \"edge effects\"; ali these greatly influence final form. The dragonfly's wing is a very good illustration of this [2.6]. \"The wing is traversed by a few strong \"veins\" or ribs, more or less parai lei to one another, between which finer veins make a meshwork of \"cells\", these lesser veins being ali much of a muchness and exerting tensions insignificant compared with those of the greater veins. Where (a) two ribs run so near together that only one row of cells lies between, these cells are quadrangular in form, their thin partitions meeting the ribs at right angles on either side. Where (b) two rows of cells are intercalated between a pair of ribs, one row fits into the other by ang les of '120°, the result of co-equal tensions; but both meet the ribs at right angles, as in the former case. Where (c) the cell rows are numerous, ali their angles in common tend to be co-equal angles of '120°, and the cells resolve, consequently, into a hexagonal network.\" (Thompson 11:476-477) 2.6 Dragonfly wing.<br>\n <br>\n On cracked surfaces, such as on ceramic glaze, mud, etc., where the cracks do not form simultaneously, 3-connected vertices still appear; however, some areas tend to meet in a 90° configuration (later cracks being perpendicular to earlier ones), rather than in the '120° configuration growing out of situations where tensions or forces are the same in ali directions (isotropic force or growth). Given a condition of surface isotropy, geometrical considerations alone limit the possibilities, and consequently tend to produce the simplest of ali nets, the three-rayed hexagonal pattern. Many writers have remarked on this. Smith ('1954) states that \"if this limitation is maintained-that three edges must always meet ata point while varying polygon types are permittedthen in any sufficiently large net the average polygon will be a hexagon.\"* *Smith goes on to show that if Vis the number of vertices, P the number of polygons, and E the number of edges in any arbitr.ary finite sample of an infinite plane net, then V + P = E + 1. lf n is the number of sides of the average polygon in an infinite plane random net, then V/P = (n - 2)/2. Readers curious as to how an infinite net can have a finite number of elements may examine the strategem employed by Coxeter (1963, p. 58).<br>\n <br>\n 2. 7 Cracked mud.<br>\n <br>\n 12<br>\n <br>\n Closest Packing in Nature<br>\n <br>\n There are numerous structures in which a final stage obscures the overall determinant of a particular form. The pinecone is one such case. Seen before it has \"opened\" up into an array of radiating branches, it clearly exhibits the closest packing of morphological units [2.8]. 2.8 Pinecone<br>\n <br>\n Although the closest packed organization of the watermelon can be readi ly seen with the naked eye, it is not likely that we would associate it with our hexagonal structures if we were not acquainted with the concept of the polar furrow [2.9]. 2.9 Watermelon<br>\n <br>\n That nature's method of closest packing is independent of scale may be inferred from the preceding illustrations. Mudcrack cells [2. 7] are of the arder of meters to decimeters wide; the watermelon [2.9] and pinecones [2.8] span decimeters to centimeters; the dragonfly-wing and honeycomb cells bring us down to millimeters; whi Ie the alveo/ i and alveolar networks [2.4, 2.5] occupy microns only. Thus we have already spanned a range of scale of six orders of magnitude. The same structure appears in the region of fractions of a micron, as in [2. i O] which shows an electron micrograph of a cross section through the exocrine cells of the pancreas of a mouse. These cells are typical of mammalian ultrastructure. The light grey areas in the photograph are the nuclei of the cells, and we can see cell boundaries that meet in three-rayed intersections. When such cells are formed they tend to compress against each other as more cells divide and crowd (closest pack) i nto the avai lable space.<br>\n <br>\n A Catalog of Natural Forms<br>\n <br>\n Metais and Crystals<br>\n <br>\n The foregoing examples of hexagons in plane forms, hierarchies, and scale independence do not of course prove that nature must act in these ways. lndeed, as in empírica/ science generally, we can never prove that observed behavior is universal, for we can only infer from particular cases; and, if nature has not quite an infinite stock of possibilities, it at least always has one more than the total number we have investigated. Nonetheless, equipped only with a reasonable faith in nature's overall consistency, we can accept induction from particular cases as a reliable guide toward the truth. In this spirit I offer the following catalog of natural forms. lts essence is visual, and its excitement, I think, lies in the exhibited variations on the hexagonal theme. Perhaps the theme will inspire some readers to investigate areas not cataloged here, while the variations will inspire others to seek (or design) similarly satisfying forms.<br>\n <br>\n [2. i i] Heated a/um inum sheet. The surface of a heated aluminum sheet shows, at the early stages of melting, a network not unlike those exhibited by a twodimensional array of soap bubbles. lt not only consistently follows the rui e of three edges meeti ng ata point, but there is a strong tendency for each point to be surrounded by i 20° ang les.<br>\n <br>\n 2.1 O Ultrastructure of exocrine cells of mo use pancreas (3, 700X, Rhodin).<br>\n <br>\n i3<br>\n <br>\n A Catalog of Natural Forms<br>\n <br>\n 2.11 Surface of a heated aluminum sheet (2.5X, Smith).<br>\n <br>\n [2.12] A/uminum-tin alloy. A dark polyhedral network is formed by the tin surrounding the light cells (crystals) of aluminum. This photograph is virtually indistinguishable from a soap bubble froth seen with the unaided eye. This is even true to the extent that the vertices are typically surrounded by four edges (four cells) meeting at approximately 109°. \"The individual grains in a piece of metal or the bubbles in a soap froth must satisfy two conditions-they must be in juxtaposition soas to fi li space and their interfaces must conform to the laws of surface tension\" (W. M. Williams and Smith).<br>\n <br>\n [2.13] Etched aluminum surface.

The grain boundaries of a section through niobium metal, revealed through etching, show a similar pattern to that of the heated aluminum sheet. In both these cases, there appears to be a lack of uniformity, but careful study reveals very few, if any, exceptions to the three-rayed vertex surrounded by ang les of 120°. The etched niobium metal sample shows- a cross section through space filling polyhedra. Each metal grain is a polyhedral crystal which meshes with its neighbors in a closest packed array. The interface between adjacent crystals where regions of different crystallographic orientation meet is called a dislocation in the crystal lattice. The intrinsic forces within the crystal grain confront the extrinsic forces which arise from the environment of neighboring crystals.<br>\n <br>\n Closest Packing in Nature<br>\n <br>\n [2. 15] Fíeld íon mícroscope photograph of platínum. A dramatic verification of the concept of closest packing as a basic structural principie of nature is achieved with the use of the field ion microscope developed by Müller (1957, 1960).

The field ion micrograph reveals various symmetrical collections of atoms which follow patterns determined by the possible combinations of planar regions of three-dimensional closest packed atoms. With an array of equal cork balls closest packed with their centers positioned on the vertices of a packing of tetragonal disphenoids, Müller has demonstrated the correspondence of sphere packing models to the actual crystal structure. The sequence reproduced here shows that the pattern exhibited by tungsten is the result of the geometry of the atomic packing.<br>\n <br>\n [2. 17] A crystal of retículated cerussite. This mineral forms an impressively uniform network structure which appears to be dominated by 60° angles. lt is what one might imagine a snow crystal would be like if it happened to take a threedimensional form rather than its familiar flat hexagonal shape. The externai forms of many crystals are well-known polyhedra, such as cubes, octahedra, and rhombic dodecahedra. The various possible options are determined by the internai structure of the atomic arrays. Likewise are the patterns revealed in the field ion micrographs determined by the internai structure of each crystal.<br>\n <br>\n 2.17 A crystal of reticulated cerussite (Smithsonian lnstitution).<br>\n <br>\n Plant Forms<br>\n <br>\n [2.18] Leaf structure.

The poppy seed exhi bits a characteristic dimpled surface which consists of raised edges forming a three-rayed network. Such a pattern is formed by.the collapse of a smooth outer shell upon an inner shell dueto a loss of moisture. When the outer shell contracts, its surface area remains substantially unchanged and consequently ridges are formed to take up the excess surface. When it is realized that surface tension plays a role in shrinkage, it is clear that the forces which ac.t upon the poppy seed are not altogether different from those which act in the determination of soapfilm formations (Thompson 11:564).<br>\n <br>\n 2.20 Cross section of a reed (25X, Jírovec).<br>\n <br>\n [2.22] Phi!odendron. In enlarged view, the upper surface of the leaf of the philodendron appears to consist of highly irregular cell shapes. lt is an example of how far away a structure may get from the appearance of the hexagon cell, yet still satisfy its basic characteristics. This structure is most rema:rkable, indeed; the wiggly lines forming the cell boundafies still manage to meet in three-rayed 120° vertices. Here the average \"polygon\" still appears to be six-sided. Although the distribution of vertices appears to be quite random, the structure is still highly ordered. The dual network of such an arrangement is still fully triangulated; but because of the extremely asymmetric shapes of the cells, the dual network would require curvature of some of its edges. lt is difficult to say precisely what forces cause this leaf surface to be structured in this manner, but it is clear that the structure is a variant of close packing.<br>\n <br>\n [2.21] Cork cel/s. Microscopic cellular structure was first observed by Hooke in the seventeenth century. In his early studies with the microscope he found cork to consist of densely packed chambers somewhat resembling the bees' honeycomb. This was the beginning of the study of cells and cell shape. A modern microscopic view of cork shows the ubiquitous hexagonal cellular structure. 2.22 Upper surface of philodendron leaf (50X, Jírovec).<br>\n <br>\n 2.19 Poppy seeds (5X, Jírovec).<br>\n <br>\n [2.23] Mushroom.

The structure of the aquatic herb \"mare's tail\" is still another demonstration of hierarchical closest packing of cells. Not only is there a progressive concentric decrease, then increase, in relative cell size, but a peripheral structure appears as a gross framework of modulated cells in which not only the cells, but the framework of which they are the elements, meet at three-rayed intersections. Many such plants consist, not of spherical cells, but of columnar forms that are hexagonal in section yet are still three-dimensional polyhedral cells whose edges still tend to meet four around each vertex in a space-filling array. 2.24 Structure of an aquatic herb (\"mare's tail,\" 70X, Jírovec).<br>\n <br>\n [2.26] The rush Juncus; formation of stel/ate cells. A curious case that illustrates the duality of triangular networks and closest packed polyhedral cells can be seen in a microphotograph of a cross section of the cel/s in the pith of the rush Juncus. As we have seen, spherical cel/s that are forced to grow against each other fi// ali unoccupied space to create polyhedra. The triangulated ce/1 structure of Juncus indicates that some other process has taken place. Thompson has suggested a formative process for Juncus in which cel/s, rather than filling ali the unoccupied space, tend to col/apse except where the original contact was made. (Thompson 11:547) This has the effect of creating ai r voids which surround \"stel/ate\" cel/s in the pith. When these stellate cells are hooked together they form the triangulated network. A diagram of this process is shown in the figure. The possibility that ali the cells of the pith would be of equal size is unlikely. Consequently the stel/ate cel/s may have varying numbers of rays; and, recalling the arguments of Lewis (1925), I believe these probably tend to average closer to 14 than 12 as suggested by Thompson.<br>\n <br>\n [2.27] Diatoms. Diatoms, tiny marine algae with silicon dioxide skeletons, frequently consist of concentric or radiating hexagonal patterns with a uniformity approaching that of the bees' honeycomb. The forces acting within and without are relatively symmetrical and the resulting forms, although infinitely varied, arealmost always quite symmetrical. Diatoms take many different kinds of shapes, including squares, triangles, and longitudinal forms. Though they do not ali show hexagonal structures in their silicon di oxide skeletons, the triangular form shown in [2.27b] is structured with nearly regular hexagons.<br>\n <br>\n 2.26 Pith cells of the rush, Juncus (200X, Jírovec) anda diagram showing formation of stellate cells upon the collapse of closest packed hexagons.<br>\n <br>\n [2.25] Redwo'od r~ot.

These siliceous skeletons are built up upon protoplasmic bodies usually consisting of collections of component vesicles which are physically equivalent to cells although they are not cells in lhe usual sense. The vesicles are, in essence, constituent modules for the larger cell. They frequently form a froth of closest packed units spherically distributed (often in concentric spheres) in a closed structure [2.32b]. The hexagonally structured skeletons are formed as the inorganic material is deposited at the intersectrons of close packed vesicles. lt is important to stress that lhe hexagonal skeletons are incomplete structures since their physica/ efficiency is achieved in cooperation with other components of the organism (the close packed vesicles). The mistake should not be made that these hexagonal radiolarian skeletons are of themselves good models for the design of physical structures. They are stable (triangulated) only by virtue of their association with the rest of the organism to which they belong. There are a few species of Radiolaria in which there are actually employed fully triangulated spherical skeletons [2.32c].<br>\n <br>\n I do not know to what processes of growth these triangulated radiolarian structures can be attributed. They are essentially duais of the hexagonal skeletons whose formation has been reasonably well explained.* We can be sure that the radiolarian skeletons are nature's most economical structural solution to some given set of conditions. The similarity of these structures to Fuller's geodesic domes cannot but strike one. According to Makowski (in Davies), the French structural i nnovator Le Ricolais had in 1940 proposed spherical-shell structures based upon the design of the triangulated networks of the Radiolaria. With this proposai, Le Ricolais anticipated Fuller's independent invention and reduction to practice of the geodesic dome which dates from approximately 1948 (Marks). *Thompson explains in great detail the process of formation of many of the radiolarian forms. However, nowhere does he discuss the triangulated spherical skeletons.<br>\n <br>\n c<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n 19<br>\n <br>\n A Catalog of Natural Forms<br>\n <br>\n [2.33] Vo/vox.

Here can be seen an electron-microscope photograph of adenovirus, and also a photograph of a sphere packing model of the same form which reveals more clearly a 20-sided icosahedral configuration. Because the icosahedron gives ri se to the most symmetrical distribution of points (or anything) on the sphere, it is reasonable that these spherical virus particles would have icosahedral symmetry.* One can assume that the virus takes this configuration in order to satisfy requirements of minimum energy and that because of the high symmetry, there must be relatively symmetrical intrinsic and extrinsic forces acting in the formation of the virus. *lt is impossible to create a convex polyhedron with more than 20 equilateral trian')les and consequently the icosahedron is the generating figure for the most symmetrical possible class of polyhedra. The subdivision of the sphere based upon the icosahedron gives ri se to the most uniform cases of triangulated spherical structures. lt has been this property of the icosahedron that Fui ler has so aptly taken advantage of in the design of his domes.

I have shown diverse examples that, for a variety of causes, exemplify patterns characteristic of close packing behavior. We cannot say that ali of the patterns shown are fully explainable only in terms of closest packing, ora law of triangulation, or even in terms of the forces of surface tension. I have simply attempted to note the occurrence of closely related, if not analogous or equivalent, patterns that do occur in nature. The differences in scale, environment, and substance do not noticeably alter the principies that I have been describing. There can be little doubt that we are dealing with some very fundamental relationships which in any case satisfy minimal principies consistently employed by nature.<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n Triangulation of Built Forms<br>\n <br>\n In Chapter 1 we saw that the triangle is the only polygon that is stable by virtue of its geometry and, passing to three dimensions, that only fully triangulated polyhedra are geometrically stable (p. 3). We now proceed to a fuller study of the CEJnsequences of the triangulation of real structures in three dimensions.<br>\n <br>\n Some Principies of Built Structure<br>\n <br>\n lt is clear, then, that a built cube, or any other nontriangulated structure, will require rigid (i.e., nonrotating) joints if it is to be itself rigid, while a triangulated construction can get along with hinged (i.e., rotating) joints without collapsing. Now the difference in the effect of rigid and hinged joints is this: the former can transmit (in fact they generate) bending forces* (couples or moments) as well as axial forces, while the latter can transmit only axial forces [3.1]. This is important when we pass over from abstract geometry into the physical world, because nearly ali materiais can resist far more stress when it is applied axially (tension or compression) than when it is applied transversely (bending).** The same strut is more effective when it is loaded as a column than when it is loaded as a beam [3.2]. *In materiais science applied forces are called stresses, and the subsequent responses of materiais are called strains. I will have no occasion to talk about strains directly in this book, and will use \"force\" and \"stress\" interchangeably. The reader may have already noted that, following the common parlance of designers, I sometimes use \"force\" in a wider sense than a physicist or engineer would, giving it the sense of \"influence\" merely, as in \"environmental forces.\" In ali cases, the meaning intended will be clear from the context.<br>\n <br>\n 3.1 Loading a square and a triangular frame. 3.2 Applying stresses axially (tension or compression) and transversely (bending).<br>\n <br>\n Co\\umn<br>\n <br>\n 22<br>\n <br>\n **In this chapter we will not consider torsion (twisting) or shear (the sliding of one portion of a material over adjacent parts), although the latter can be considered a byproduct of bending.<br>\n <br>\n By coupling the fortunate inadequacy ot hinged joints to the geometrical stabi lity, we can allow ou r built torms to take advantage ot their struts' high axial strength, and avoid having to rely on their poor resistance to bending.* However, because nontriangulated structures require coupleinducing joints, such built torms must perforce respond to moments; they must, and do, distort easily under load. *A not inconsequential advantage ot manycelled triángulated structures, arising trom their propensity to distribute stress axially, is their ability to share stress applied to one vertex over a large number ot cells. This property could be illustrated by elaborating on the experiments ot p. 3. The property is tully exploited by the space trames discussed Iater in this chapter.<br>\n <br>\n 3.3 Loaded trames.<br>\n <br>\n cubi~<br>\n <br>\n The loaded Frames This interaction between purely geometric stability, the properties of joints, and the axial and transverse strengths of materiais is illustrated in the experiment with loaded trames that I will now describe. Without an appreciation of this interaction the experiment m ig ht appear to be simplistic; with it, as we will see, the experiment is the bridge between abstraction and a concrete functional geometry. The questions betore us are these: How will a nontriangulated (but, by virtue of its joints, rigid) trame compare to a triangulated one under load? Given that each is constructed of the same type and amount of material, which will collapse soonest? Will there be a difference in their behavior on the way to collapse? The comparison of nontriangulated and triangulated trames is taci litated by the relationship of the square-faced cube to the triangular-faced octahedron. Both polyhedra are comprised of 12 edges. Therefore, when a trame of each figure is constructed of strut members ot the same material, diameter, cross-sectional shape and area, and length, they may be considered to be equal in terms of the amount of material they use, or in terms of resource investment. In short, they would weigh and cost the same. Therefore, it is possible, by loading each of these equal weight structures, to directly compare the performance in terms of strength to weight ot nontriangulated and triangulated trameworks.<br>\n <br>\n (a) and octahedral (b)<br>\n <br>\n liiJ<br>\n <br>\n A cube was assembled out of twelve Va\" diameter polyethylene struts each 4%\" long; these were joined at its eight corners by means of rigid metal connectors. An octahedron was also assembled with twel~e of the same struts joined at each ot its six corners with a wire connection that functioned more or less as a multidirectional hinged joint. A plastic container, to contain lead shot, was placed on a plastic panel resting on the upper face of each structure. The plastic pane I was rigid, so that it did not deflect when loaded, and ali loads were transmitted through it to the supporting vertices.<br>\n <br>\n a<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n 23<br>\n <br>\n The Loaded Frames<br>\n <br>\n The tirst sequence in [3.3] shows the gradual collapse ot the loaded cube and the second sequence shows the gradual collapse of the loaded octahedron. The cube collapsed totally under a load of 774 balls of lead shot (1,180 grams) and the octahedron collapsed totally under a load of 1,488 balls (2,269 grams). The octahedron in this experiment is nearly twice as strong with the same amount ot material, even though it was constructed with flexible joints. The octahedron, when loaded with the 77 4 balls of lead shot that caused the cube to collapse, showed little orno sign of distortion dueto bending moments. Bending moments are induced by the rigid joints; it is these moments that give ri se to the \"S\" curves in the struts of the loaded cube. By contrast, the octahedron exhibits no such bending moments. lnstead, a simple are is induced by the axial stress in the members as they reach their compressive limits. We see trom [3.3], that the horizontal members of the octahedral trame do not bend. This is because they are loaded in tension; the hinging joints do not allow the bending of the oblique members to be shared with the horizontal members. lf the joints were rigid, the bending could be shared by ali members, thus increasing the total load capacity of the triangulated framework. Before the point where bending begins, however, it makes no structural difference whether the joints are hinged or rigid. The foregoing experiments were very simple, almost simplistic, but they do demonstrate the structural advantages of triangulated frameworks. One could go on trom here to make increas; ingly complex and sophisticated experiments which might include other variables such as volume and surface area as well as different methods of joining the struts. Ali the same, the inherent advantage of triangulated structures in terms of strength to weight is clearly established.<br>\n <br>\n Space Frames Alexander Graham Bel I discovered in his search for lightweight structures suitable for flight a framework built up from equilateral triangles. This system consists of regular tetrahedra and regular octahedra. Bel I used such structures, not only for his beautiful kites, but also as the basis of a windbreak and an observation tower [3.4]. Bell's essay of 1903 testifies to his awareness of the superior strength per unit weight properties of triangulated structures. Buckminster Fuller, Robert Le Ricolais, and others in recent years have designed structures which utilize this system pioneered by Bell (see McHale 1962; Makowski 1966a).<br>\n <br>\n 24<br>\n <br>\n Bell's kite is an early (though still very useful) example of what has come to be called space trame structure. Space frames are called for when large areas must be spanned; these structures combine lightness and enhanced resistance to bending. They can be recognized by their use of a single, or at most a small number, of strut lengths, joined by means of standardized connections. Because of their high resistance to bending, planar space frames have been typically used for roofs. Although they are justas applicable, they have been rarely used for walls or vertical supports, presumably dueto architectural design constraints (extrinsic forces), rather than dueto the inherent properties of space frames (intrinsic forces). Fuller's geodesic domes and other curved space frames do away, so to speak, with walls and roofs entirely, replacing vertical-compression elements (walls) and bending elements (roofs) by warped surfaces capable of distributing stresses \"isotropically\" throughout the structure. Let us consider the span-todepth ratio of a space frame. This is the ratio of the distance between vertical supporting structures (the span) and the depth or thickness of the frame [3.5]. A 30:1 ratio is generally considered to be the upper limit (Salvadori and Hei ler, p. 126).<br>\n <br>\n Looking at the tetrahedral/octahedral space frame in plan, we note that it fits into a triangular grid. Because of this, it does not appear to be as adaptable to rectilinear structures as certain other systems. The 90° bias of structural designers and architects has prevented a more frequent use of this and other structuresbased upon 60° or 120° grids. The tetrahedral/octahedral space frame can fit into a square grid, but if this is done with a single layer, the octahedra are cut into square pyramids and are not completely stable. This requires the addition of a long diagonal brace on the square face of the half-octahedron, or the use of rigid joints, both of which stratagems can reduce the simplicity and increase the weight of the system.<br>\n <br>\n a<br>\n <br>\n 3.4 Alexander Graham Bell's windbreak (a) and tower (b) (National Geographic Society).<br>\n <br>\n Some Principies of Built Structure<br>\n <br>\n In the 1959 Fuller exhibit at the Museum of Modem Art in New York, a tetrahedral/ octahedral space frame with a depth of approximately 3Vz feet was cantilevered 60 feet. Thus, if supported at two ends, such a system would have a 35:1 spanto-depth ratio. Even this is nota good indication of the potential of space frames. Out of the bias toward 90° geometry, we usually think of supporting space frames at only two (or four) opposite sides. But because space frames are based upon a 60° (or 120°) geometry, they can be conveniently supported on three (or six) sides. This alters the idea of span-todepth ratio, and suggests that ratios greater than 35 :I might be obtainable.*<br>\n <br>\n 3.5 Space trame span-to-depth ratio.<br>\n <br>\n I<br>\n <br>\n I<br>\n <br>\n l<br>\n <br>\n ~T<br>\n <br>\n *For surveys ot space trame systems and their applications see Makowski (1965), Wachsman, and Borrego.<br>\n <br>\n \\<br>\n <br>\n \\ \\.<br>\n <br>\n \\<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n 25<br>\n <br>\n Span<br>\n <br>\n Space Frames<br>\n <br>\n Locallnstability in Planar and Domical Space Frames As discussed in Chapter 1, any convex polyhedron bounded by plane polygons other than triang les suffers from geometrical instability. We can give a polyhedron overa/1 stability against distributed loads -i.e., stability against any load that can be resisted by a large part of the figure via distribution through the structural members of which it is made-by triangulating ali of its faces. However, the structure will still suffer from local instability. This instability arises within the now triangulated, but still planar, faces, because any vertex that is within the boundaries of, and coplanar to, a given face is not rigid with respect to forces directed perpendicular to the face.<br>\n <br>\n So the first way of dealing with local instability isto replace the \"monolayer\" faces by space frames. Thus we have still planar, but now thickened (and triangulated), faces. The second solution isto build up our surface space frame incrementally, by placing the vertices of the triangulating subdivisions above or below the polygon planes so that a periodically convex or concave surface is created. This approach is more economical than the first one, but it introduces additiona:l faceting over the parent polyhedron. Figure [3. 7] shows a faceted figure-a fully triangulated truncated octahedron which has become, in effect, a simple dome. 3. 7 A fully triangulated truncated octahedron.<br>\n <br>\n There are two ways to deal with this condition. 8oth stem from the fact that resistance to a load directed normal to a structure is proportional to the thickness of the structure inthe direction ofthe load. Or, what amounts to the same thing, resistance to compression is greater than resistance to bending. 8oth formulations can be illustrated with a piece of paper. As a sheet, it has virtually no resistance to an applied load. However, if it is folded accordion-style, it becomes rigid [3.6].<br>\n <br>\n One might say that the whole trick to designing successful domes is an awareness of the two methods of dealing with local loads.* The idea of span-to-depth ratio still applies; but in the case of domes we must formulate it by comparing the diameter of the dome to the number ot modular increments (polygons) of whiçh it is made. lf this ratio of circumference to number of modules gets too high, those regions on the dome's surface surrounding single vertices become nearly flat, and thus lose their resistance to concentrated loads. This may be shown schematically by means of polygons inscribed in semicircles [3.8]. For distributed loads, the semicircle's strength is reflected in the very low span-to-depth ratio that, for such loading, is taken as the diameter o ver the height, o r 2:1. However, this says nothing about the semicircle's resistance to concentrated loads. 8ut if the semicircle is divided into two modular increments, it wi/1 have a high resistance to a load concentrated at the vertex. lncreasing the modular frequency gives us more places (vertices) where concentrated loads may be resisted, but, at the same time, because of the increasing planarity in the neighborhoods of vertices, the strength at each vertex is decreasing. *A moment's reflection will show that a structure cannot be made fully stable, i.e., it cannot be fully triangulated, unless it is closed. Spheres and their polyhedral approximations are closed, even when free; whereas domes cannot be considered closed unless they are tied to the ground. The effect of closure upon stability will come up again !ater in this book.<br>\n <br>\n Truss Depth /<br>\n <br>\n ~<br>\n <br>\n 3.6 Folding a sheet increases its resistance to bending.<br>\n <br>\n 26<br>\n <br>\n 3.8 The hemisphere as a truss. lncreasing lhe modular incrementation of lhe truss decreases lhe ability of vertices to resist concentrated loads.<br>\n <br>\n Some Principies of 8uilt Structure<br>\n <br>\n Fuller's geodesic domes have been known'to span over 100ft. with no surface depth at ali, short of the diameter of the tubular metal struts; a balanced response to the conflicting demand for local and overall stability. However, with the 200foot Kaiser dome, faceting was not sufficient to resist the local loads, so the thickened-face space trame solution had to be added [3.9]. Even so, the Kaiser dome required a space trame only one foot deep-a 200:1 \"span-to-depth\" ratio! Fuller combined the advantage of the sphere (resistance to distributed loads) with that of the tetrahedral/octahedral space trame (resistance to local loads), by wrapping the double layer space trame around the sphere. Planarity invites bending moments; and is a generally poor way in which to build. Generally, any curved, and particularly any doubly curved, surface will have higher strength per unit of invested resources than a planar system built of an equivalent amount of the same material. This is a primary reason for the use of curved surfaces or their polyhedral approximations wherever flatness is not absolutely required. In either case, plane or curved, we can assume that triangulation provides the optimum structural framework.<br>\n <br>\n 3.9 Wrapping a space trame around a hemisphere solves the problem of concentrated loads.<br>\n <br>\n 27<br>\n <br>\n Local lnstabi Iity<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n Ordering Principies and Geometry<br>\n <br>\n ( In this and the following chapter we will study the geometrical basis of the orderly subdivision of space. lf we can inventory ali possible ways in which space can be organized, we will come to know the intrinsic forces that determine the geometric options in three-dimensional space and, hence, can develop a comprehensive morphological system. We will begin by examining tessellations (tilings) of the plane and proceed from this to a description of polyhedra.<br>\n <br>\n Tessellations of the Plane<br>\n <br>\n Regular Tessellations<br>\n <br>\n A plane tessellation is an infinite set of polygons fitting together to cover the whole plane just once, so that every si de of each polygon belongs also to one other polygon (Coxeter 1963). As we shall see later, the plane tessellation is a special case of an infinite polyhedron.<br>\n <br>\n A regular tessellation is a pattern of congruent regular polygons filling the whole plane, on which ali vertices of the tessellation are surrounded alike (uniform). There are only three possible regular tessellations. They are the tessellations of triang les, of squares, and of hexagons. There are no other cases. This can be simply explained by pointing out that in order to subdivide lhe plane with polygons, the angles around each vertex must sum to 360°. In lhe case of regular tessellations this means that only polygons can be used that have face angles that can be whole-number subdivisions of 360°. The triangle, with face angles of 60°, divides 360° into 6 parts; therefore, a tessellation of triangles has six polygons meeting at each vertex. A square, with angles of 90°, divides into 360° into 4 parts; therefore, a tessellation of squares will have four polygons meeting at each vertex. A pentagon has face ang les of 108° which cannot be divided into 360° by a Whole number, and is therefore not capable of tessellating. A hexagon has 120° face angles, which divides 360° into 3 parts; therefore, a tessellation of hexagons will have three polygons meeting at each vertex. Less than three polygons rneeting at a vertex cannot subdivide lhe plane. Therefore, any polygon with face angles greater than 120° wi li not be capable of forming a tessellation.<br>\n <br>\n 4.1 Regular and semiregular tessellations of the plane .<br>\n <br>\n • 28<br>\n <br>\n Semiregular Tessellations<br>\n <br>\n Tessellations with Regular Polygons<br>\n <br>\n There is a second class of planar partitioning known as semi regular tessellations. This class requires that ali polygons be regular, and that ali vertices be congruent, but permits the use of more than one kind of polygon. In this case the 360° around each vertex can be matched by the summed face angles of more than one type of polygon. There are only eight possible cases of semiregular plane tessellations. They consist of various combinations of triangles, squares, hexagons, octagons, and dodecagons (12 sides). One of these, consisting of triang les and ·hexagons, can be assembled in right- or lefthanded form. Such figures (called enantiomorphs) are mirrar images of one another. The regular and semiregular tessellations are illustrated in [4.1].<br>\n <br>\n When some of these conditions of arder are relaxed an entirely new range of possibilities emerges. lf, for example, we only impose the requirement that the entire plane be filled exclusively with regular polygons, but do not require that ali vertices be surrounded by equal angles, we find that we can construct a new class of tessellations in which an infinite number of patterns are possible. lt is surprising to find, however, that there are sti li very few types of polygons that we may use. In fact we may use no more than those that appear in the semiregular tessellations. The reason, of course, is the same as before-each vertex must still be surrounded by exactly 360°, and therefore polygons may be combined around any vertex only when thei r face ang les sum to 360°. Some examples of this infinite class of tessellation are shown in [ 4.2]. 4.2 Tessellations with regular polygons.<br>\n <br>\n 29<br>\n <br>\n Tessellations of the Plane<br>\n <br>\n Tessellations and Symmetry<br>\n <br>\n Though I defer unti I the following chapter a systematic study of the relationship between symmetry and space filling, before we proceed further we will need a working appreciation of the ideas of rotational and mirror symmetry. The rotational symmetry of any figure is determined by counting the number of times it repeats or reproduces itself in one revolution about an axis. Only four kinds of rotational symmetry are possible in the uniform subdivision of space: 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold [ 4.3]. A polygon has mirror symmetry when one si de is the reflection of the other si de about a common line which bisects the polygorl) (This is also known as bilateral symmeily.) lt is possible to uniformly subdivide space with figures having only mirror symmetry and with figures having no symmetry at ali [4.4]. Though the drawings give two-dimensional examples, we shall later see that the same laws of symmetry hold in three dimensions, and that any given three-dimensional uniform structure will consist of various combinations of the four rotational symmetries, the mirror symmetry, and/ or no symmetry.<br>\n <br>\n a<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n c<br>\n <br>\n d<br>\n <br>\n We have seen that the regular pentagon will not serve as a tile in the regular tessellation of the plane. Another way of saying this is that figures cannot repeat themselves on 5-fold axes of symmetry. There is a distorted pentagon which will tile the plane, but it has only mirror symmetry [ 4.5]. 4.5 A mirror-symmetric pentagon that fills the plane.<br>\n <br>\n 4.6 Open patterns with regular polygons.<br>\n <br>\n 4.4 Tessellations of polygons with mirrar symmetry (a) and no symmetry (b).<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n 30<br>\n <br>\n lf we eliminate the requirements that ali of the plane be filled and that ali vertices be congruent, but simply consider periodic subdivisions of the plane, with regular polygons, a third class of possibilities emerges. With the remova! of the need to fi li ali spaces with polygons, it is no longer necessary that we use polygons with face angles that can be combined to give 360°. We will still have 360° at each vertex; it is just that a vertex does not have to be entirely surrounded by regular polygons. Such a condition gives rise to \"open spaces\" of non-regular polygons, many of which are concave. In this class, polygons of 5, 9, 1O, and 20 sides may be used. Some examples are shown in [ 4.6]* *These examples were the results of some empírica! studies conducted by the author with 2nd year architecture students at the University of Southern California.<br>\n <br>\n 4.3 Tessellations of polygons with n-fold symmetries: 2-fold (a), 3-fold (b), 4-fold (c), and 6-fold (d).<br>\n <br>\n a<br>\n <br>\n Open Patterns with Regular Polygons<br>\n <br>\n Ordering Principies and Geometry<br>\n <br>\n Dual Tessellations<br>\n <br>\n Concentric Patterns with Regular Pentagons<br>\n <br>\n Although the pentagon does not tessellate the plane, it has the curious property that it generates infinite concentrically repeating open patterns [ 4. ?a]. Such concentric open patterns have only one axis of rotational symmetry, about the center of the central pentagon-the only one which shares ali of its edges with other pentagons. This kind of pattern is quite different from an infinite tessellation of regular hexagons where ali cells are symmetrically equivalent, i.e., the environment around each cell is like that around every other. A variety of concentric patterns can be assembled with pentagons and I or decagons [4.7b]. Because the decagon has twice as many sides as a pentagon, their symmetry properties are similar. We observe there are two great classes of regular figures: first, pentagons, septagons, decagons, etc., that give rise to concentric packing systems; and second, tri ang les, sq uares, hexagons, nonagons, etc., that repeat inthe plane in true crystallographic fashion-that is, with no unique center of symmetry. Only those regular polygons with numbers of sides that are divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6 are capable of infinite repetition in the plane, i.e., only those regular polygons having multi pies of 2, 3, 4, or 6-fold symmetry can be the basis of a periodic open pattern. Here Iam considering the general case, in which it is not required that a// the space be fi lled with regular polygons-only that the polygons could be fit together to generate a repetitive pattern. We can further surmise that any regular polygon which is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, or 6 will be capable of generating concentric patterns with a center of symmetry. From this it is apparent that any regular polygon that is divisible by 5 can generate concentric patterns with a uni que axis of symmetry for the infinite array.<br>\n <br>\n The concept of the reciproca! or dual network was important to our discussion of closest packed systems. As we shall see, it is also fundamental to the understanding of the properties of ali periodic spatial systems. We have already noted the duality of triangular networks and hexagonal networks. A dual network is formed by joining the centers of each polygon to ali neighboring polygons through the shared edges. Only one of the regular and semiregular plane tessellations is dual to itself-namely, the square grid. The dual network always forms polygons which are the domains of the vertices; i.e., polygonal domains will have the same number of edges as there are edges meeting at the vertex it encloses.* Any network of a plane tessellation with congruent vertices will have a unique plane-filling domain formed by its dual network. In the case of the array of squares, there are four edges meeting at each vertex at 90°. When the centers of each square face are joined with edges to the centers of ali neighboring squares, another array of squares is generated. The polygonal domain of the vertex is a square. Since the tessellations of triangles and hexagons are dual to each other, they form the polygonal domains of each other's networks. In the case of the semi regular tessellations, the dual networks form congruent polygons, but none are regular. Each polygonal domain is capable of repeating itself to fi li the plane. Of the eight cases only one has rotational symmetry (2-fold), one has no symmetry and six have mirror symmetry<br>\n <br>\n [4.8]. *These two-dimensional polygonal domains are analogous to the three-dimensional polyhedral domains discussed in Chapter I, pp. 8-9.<br>\n <br>\n Periodic structures generated as open patterns of regular polygons is a subject that, to my knowledge, has been little studied and has only been briefly investigated here.<br>\n <br>\n 31<br>\n <br>\n Tessellations of the Plane<br>\n <br>\n a<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n 4. 7 Concentric repeating patterns with regular pentagons (a), and regular pentagons I regular decagons (b). 4.8 Dual networks of regular and semi regular tessellations.<br>\n <br>\n t-<br>\n <br>\n -j --j-<br>\n <br>\n -t- +1-+<br>\n <br>\n -~<br>\n <br>\n -+--<br>\n <br>\n +-+ -t- + -+ -+ +- + -+- + -+·1-t +- +-i- -r- +-i L _ _j_<br>\n <br>\n I<br>\n <br>\n I<br>\n <br>\n Polyhedra and Their Duais<br>\n <br>\n Regular Polyhedra and Their Duais<br>\n <br>\n As mentioned earlier, in the plane ifis necessary that ali vertices be surrounded by polygons whose face ang les sum to 360°. In a finite polyhedron it is necessary that ali vertices be surrounded by polygons whose face angles sum to less than 360°; thus a three-dimensional convex figureis formed. When ali of the vertices of such a polyhedron share a common sphere it may be considered to be a finite tessellation of the sphere. *<br>\n <br>\n The first important class of polyhedra are those that are convex and regular. They are composed of regular and equal polygonal faces with ali of their vertices equivalently surrounded. There are only five possible cases, the so called Platonic solids, discussed in Chapter 1 (see<br>\n <br>\n *An example of a fundamental space relationship that can be expressed algebraically is Euler's theorem for polyhedra. lt states that for any polyhedron that is singly connected with nonintersecting faces, lhe number of faces (P), the number of vertices (V), and lhe number of edges (E), satisfythe equation P+V= E+ 2. This concisely states lhe fact that there is always a consistent relationship among lhe inventory of components of any finite modular structure. For example, the tetrahedrón has 4 faces plus 4 vertices which equal its 6 edges plus 2. The octahedron has 8 faces plus 6 vertices which equal12 edges plus 2, etc. In t t dimensions the equation changes slightly. I any finite arbitrary sample of an infinite plane essellation, the number of polygons, lhe number of vertices, and the number of edges satisfy P + V= E + 1 (see footnote, p. 12). In any random or symmetrical array of packed polygons this relationship holds.<br>\n <br>\n [U]). Justas it is possible to generate dual networks for the plane tessellations, it is possible to generate polyhedral duais. The dual polyhedron is formed in a manner analogous to that described for the plane tessellation. However, for polyhedra the reciprocation process is somewhat more complicated: a point perpendicularly above the center of each face of a given polyhedron is joined with new edges to similar points above ali neighboring faces such that the new edges that connect these points intersect the edges of the original polyhedron, thus forming the edges of a new dual polyhedron [ 4.9]. This pair of dual polyhedra must enclose a common sphere that is tangent to both, at the points where their respective edges intersect. lt is usually true that the respective edges of dual polyhedra perpendicularly bisect each other. lt follows from this process of reciprocation that any given polyhedron and its dual will have the same number of edges, and the inventaries of faces and vertices will be exactly reversed.<br>\n <br>\n 4.9 Dual regular polyhedra.<br>\n <br>\n 32<br>\n <br>\n Ordering Principies and Geometry<br>\n <br>\n We saw that of the plane tessellations the only self-dual was the array of squares. There is only one polyhedron that is a self-dual. lt is the regular tetrahedron, which is the only figure to have the same number of vertices as faces. The cube and the regular octahedron are dual. They each have twelve edges, and the cuba has six faces and eight vertices, while the octahedron has eight faces and six vertices. The pentagonal dodecahedron and icosahedron are dual. They each have thirty edges. Whi Ie the dodecahedron has twelve faces and twenty vertices, the icosahedron has twenty faces and twelve vertices. Like the regular plane tessellations, the duais of regular polyhedra are also regular polyhedra, which is a unique property of these regular figures. The duality of the regular polyhedra is shown in [4.9].<br>\n <br>\n Semiregular Polyhedra and Their Duais<br>\n <br>\n The existence of the semiregular plane tessellations suggests an equivalent class of polyhedra. The semiregular polyhedra, like their two-dimensional counterparts, require that ali polygons be regular but not equal, and that ali vertices be equivalently surrounded. A set of thirteen semiregular figures are usually referred to as the Archimedean solids, since Archimedes was supposedly the first to have studied them. Archimedes' book on the subject has been lost. Kepler made the first complete investigation of ali possible semiregular polyhedra.<br>\n <br>\n 4.1 O a b c d e f g h i j k I m<br>\n <br>\n The thirteen Archimedean polyhedra consist of various combinations of triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons, octagons, and decagons. Recai! that neither the pentagon nor decagon appear in the plane tessellations, and note that the dodecagon, which does appear in the plane tessellations, does not appear in any of these polyhedra. No single polyhedron is constructed of ali six types of polygons. Ten of these Archimedean figures utilize only two kinds of polygons, and the remaining three utilize three kinds of polygons. These thirteen polyhedra are shown in [4.10].<br>\n <br>\n The thirteen Archimedean polyhedra: Truncated tetrahedron Cuboctahedron Snub cuboctahedron Truncated octahedron Rhombicuboctahedron Truncated cube Truncated cuboctahedron Truncated icosahedron lcosidodecahedron Snub icosidodecahedron Rhombicosidodecahedron Truncated dodecahedron Truncated icosidodecahedron<br>\n <br>\n 33<br>\n <br>\n Polyhedra and their Duais<br>\n <br>\n For each of the convex regular and semiregular polyhedra, ali vertices fali on a common sphere. That is, the vertices of any one of these polyhedra are always equidistant from a common center. Ali of the Archimedean polyhedra can be derived from the five Platonic figures by truncations (cutting off) of vertices and I or edges. The obvious examples are the truncated tetrahedron, truncated octahedron, truncated cube, truncated dodecahedron, and the truncated icosahedron. The cuboctahedron can be simply derived from the truncation of the cube or octahedron, etc. Careful examination will reveal that ali the Archimedean polyhedra can be generated by means of such truncations.<br>\n <br>\n The duais of the Archimedean polyhedra exhibit many similarities to the duais of the semiregular tessellations. No dual to an Archimedean polyhedron is composed of regular polygons o r even necessari ly of polygons of equal edge, but ali of its faces are congruent. The inventory of faces consists of three-, four-, and fivesided polygons which appear with the following symmetries: two with 2-fold symmetry (rhombic faces), nine with mirrar symmetry, and two with no symmetry. Seven of the thirteen dual polyhedra are bounded by congruent triang les and for this reason some have more than passing interest for our study. Ali thirteen of the dual polyhedra are shown and named in<br>\n <br>\n [4.11].<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n 4.11<br>\n <br>\n Duais of lhe Archimedean polyhedra:<br>\n <br>\n Figure a Triakis tetrahedron b Rhombic dodecahedron c Pentagonal icositetrahedron d Tetrakis hexahedron e Trapezoidal icositetrahedron f Triakis octahedron g Hexakis octahedron h Pentakis dodecahedron i Rhombic triacontahedron j Pentagonal hexecontahedron k Trapezoidal hexecontahedron I Triakis icosahedron m Hexakis icosahedron<br>\n <br>\n Dual of Truncated tetrahedron Cuboctahedron Snub cuboctahedron Truncated octahedron Rhombicuboctahedron Truncated cube Truncated cuboctahedron Truncated icosahedron lcosidodecahedron Snub icosidodecahedron Rhombicosidodecahedron Truncated dodecahedron Truncated icosidodecahedron<br>\n <br>\n 34<br>\n <br>\n Ordering Principies and Geometry<br>\n <br>\n The two figures with rhombic faces, the rhombic dodecahedron and the rhombic triacontahedron, are particularly significant as they are the only duais which have equal edge lengths. We recai! from ou r study of cell aggregates that the rhombic dodecahedron is an often-metwith space filling polyhedron.<br>\n <br>\n Unlike the semiregular tessellations, there are two infinite groups consisting of the prisms and antiprisms, in addition to the Archimedean figures. The prisms and antiprisms correspond to the infinite number of possible polygons. A semiregular prism is made up of two parai lei regular polygons of any number of sides, connected in equatorial fashion by square faces [4.12]. The antiprisms are likethe prisms except that the equatorial polygons are equilateral triang les [ 4.13]. Two of the regular polyhedra fali into one each of these categories. The cube is a square prism, and the octahedron is a triangular antiprism. The duais of prisms are called the dipyramids (double pyramids), whose faces are congruent isosceles triangles [4.14]. The duais ofthe antiprisms are called trapezohedra andare double pyramid-like figures bounded by congruent trapezia [ 4.15].<br>\n <br>\n (<br>\n <br>\n Before we can proceed further, I must define the dihedral angle. The dihedral angle is the angle formed between the planes of two adjacent polygons, the angle taken in a plane perpendicular to the common edge [4.16]. Ali ofthe dihedral angles for each of the regular polyhedra are equal. However, of the semiregular polyhedra, only the cuboctahedron and the icosidodecahedron have equal dihedral angles. There are nine Archimedean figures which have two dihedral angles and two which have three. The dihedral angle will become quite an important concept as we consider the problem of space filling polyhedra.* *For a complete atlas of specifications including angular data for regular and semi regular polyhedra see Cundy and Rollett.<br>\n <br>\n 4.12 Semiregular prisms.<br>\n <br>\n 4.14 Dipyramids, the duais of prisms.<br>\n <br>\n 4.13 Semiregular antiprisms.<br>\n <br>\n 4.15 Trapezohedra, the duais of antiprisms.<br>\n <br>\n 4.16 Dihedral angle: the angle formed between planes. \\<br>\n <br>\n \\<br>\n <br>\n \\<br>\n <br>\n 35<br>\n <br>\n Polyhedra and their Duais<br>\n <br>\n Compound, Quasiregular, and Stellated Polyhedra When the cube and octahedron are interlinked with their edges bisecting each other at right ang les, a compound polyhedron is formed. The 14 apices of this compound polyhedron are the 14 vertices of the rhombic dodecahedron. The edges of the compound figure form the long and short diagonais of the rhombic faces of the dodecahedron [ 4.17]. When the pentagonal (regular) dodecahedron and icosahedron are interlinked in similar fashion, the resulting 32 apices are the vertices of the rhombic triacontahedron and its edges form the long and short diagonais of the rhombic faces of the triacontahedron [ 4.18]. Two tetrahedra (remember, the tetrahedron is self-dual) can be inter! inked to form a compound called by Kepler the stella octangula. lts eight apices are the vertices of a cube and its edges are the diagonais of the cube faces [ 4.19]. lt is illuminating to consider the polyhedra which form the centers or nuclei of the foregoing three compounds. The stella octangula can be formed by placing eight regular tetrahedra on the faces of a regular octahedron. The cube-and-octahedron compound has a cuboctahedron as its nucleus. The compound can be formed when six square pyramids and eight triangular pyramids are placed on the faces of the cuboctahedron (assuming, of course, that the proper face ang les are used for the triangular faces of the pyramids). The icosahedron-anddodecahedron has as its nucleus the icosidodecahedron. The compound can be formed by placing twenty triangular pyramids and twelve pentagonal pyramids on the faces of the icosidodecahedron, again assuming that the pro per angles are used. These three polyhedra, the octahedron, the cuboctahedron, and icosidodecahedron, are sometimes known as the quasiregular polyhedra.<br>\n <br>\n Such a polyhedron has ali of its dihedral ang les equal, its vertices are congruent, and its faces are of two kinds, each face of one kind being entirely surrounded by the faces of the other kind. Ali three cases have four-connected vertices and they are the only examples of regular and semiregular figures to have plane equatorial polygons. The octahedron is quasiregular only when its triangular faces are treated as two subsets of four each, such that three of one set always surround one of the other set. The duais of these quasiregular polyhedra are the figures generated by the compounds for which they form nuclei. The cube is dual to the octahedron; the rhombic dodecahedron is dual to the cuboctahedron; and the rhombic triacontahedron is dual to the icosidodecahedron.<br>\n <br>\n The intersection of faces reflects a relatively more abstract concept of space than we have heretofore discussed, simply because it is physically impossible to achieve without actually cutting up the polygons into irregular parts. In the formal classification of these stellated forms, the intersecting polygons form new edges and vertices which are not counted in fhe inventory of properties. Although these stellated forms have some morphological interest, they are of minar importance in the present study. They will contribute little to our theory of spatial modularity. *See also Coxeter et ai., 1938, for a discussion of a special family of stellated polyhedra derived from lhe icosahedron.<br>\n <br>\n We have so far limited our discussion of regular and semiregular polyhe:dra to convex figures composed of convex regular plane polygons. There is a very large class of nonconvex uniform polyhedra. They are loosely referred to as stellated polyhedra. A detailed account of these figures can be found in \"Uniform Polyhedra\" (Coxeter, Lonquet-Higgins, and Miller 1954), where, in addition to the regular and semiregular convex polyhedra, fiftyseven other polyhedra are described.* Among these are four stellated forms known as the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are those that have regular faces. However, because their faces and edges intersect, these forms are generally far more complex than the simple convex polyhedra. Although they are composed of plane polygons, because of the intersections multifaceted polyhedra are formed with both convex and concave regions. This is characteristic of ali of the stellated polyhedra.<br>\n <br>\n 4.17 Rhombic dodecahedron formed as a compound of lhe cube and octahedron.<br>\n <br>\n ( ~<br>\n <br>\n 4.18 Rhombic triacontahedron formed as a compound of lhe pentagonal dodecahedron and lhe icosahedron. 4.19 Cube formed as a compound of two tetrahedra.<br>\n <br>\n 36<br>\n <br>\n Ordering Principies and Geometry<br>\n <br>\n Convex Polyhedra Composed of Regular Polygons<br>\n <br>\n So far we have seen that by restricting ourselves to regular, convex plane polygons and a uniformity of vertices for any given figure, the class of possible types of polyhedra that can be formed is very limited: the five Platonic, the thirteen Archimedean polyhedra, and the two infinite families of prisms and antiprisms. lf we relax the requirement of uniformity short of the use of regular plane polygons (as we did with the plane tessellations), does this give rise to another set of possible polyhedra? We saw that there is no apparent limit to the number of different tessellation pàtterns which can be assembled with the five regular polygons that qualify as tiles. However, in the case of convex polyhedra ther~ are a surprisingly small number of possibilities. Johnson (1966) has propo~ed that in addition to the regular and semiregular polyhedra there are just 92 others. lt is remarkable to realize that the only kinds of faces that a regular-faced solid (beyond prisms and antiprisms) may have are triang les, squares, pentagons, hexagons, octagons, and decagons. The most surprising thing of ali is that the list of allowable polygons is precisely the same as that for the regular and semiregular polyhedra. This is another example of a minumum inventory of components that wi I! yield diversity of form.<br>\n <br>\n lt is possible with an inventory of six regu\\ lar polygons to assemble exactly 120 ) convex polyhedra, including the appropriate finite set of prisms and antiprisms. Of these 120, there are only 1O convex polyhedra that can be made which have congruent regular faces. In addition to the five Platonic polyhedra, there are five others ali bounded by equilateral triangles, although it is only in the Platonic figures that ali vertices are equidistant from a common center. Of these ten polyhedra, ali but the cube and the dodecahedron have triangular faces. We have already noted a special interest in triangulated polyhedra, because of their effectiveness as physical structures, and we can now enumerate ali eight cases of convex deltahedra (polyhedra bounded by equilateral triangles). The convex deltahedra are as follows: tetrahedron-four faces; triangular dipyramid-six faces; octahedron-eight; pentagonal dipyramid-ten; snub disphenoidtwelve; triaugmented triangular prismfourteen; gyroelongated square dipyramid-sixteen; and icosahedrontwenty faces. These are shown in [ 4.20]. The names of the twelve-, fourteen-, and sixteen-hedra are dueto Johnson (1966).<br>\n <br>\n a<br>\n <br>\n 4.20 a b c d e f g h<br>\n <br>\n The convex deltahedra: Tetrahedron (4-hedron) Triangular dipyramid (6-hedron) Octahedron (8-hedron) Pentagonal dipyramid (1 0-hedron) 12-hedron 14-hedron 16-hedron lcosahedron (20-hedron)<br>\n <br>\n 37<br>\n <br>\n Convex Polyhedra<br>\n <br>\n We have now a prototypical array of geometric structures that reveals a richness and diversity within the constraints of an extraordinary order. lt seems at times almost unbelievable, for example, that there can be only five convex regular polyhedra. This may seem to be a frustrating limitation. However, I hope to show that it is rather a beautiful and useful phenomenon. Without knowledge of these geometric structures and their relationships, the possibility of developing a comprehensive morphological system for modular structures is nil.<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n c<br>\n <br>\n d<br>\n <br>\n e<br>\n <br>\n g<br>\n <br>\n h<br>\n <br>\n 5<br>\n <br>\n Symmetry and Space Filling<br>\n <br>\n With this underlying background in plane tessellations and finite polyhedra, we must now move to a subject which, if it is not the most exciting in ali geometry, is certainly of the highest importance in our search for a theory of modularity: the concept of space filling polyhedra, which ultimately leads us to the general properties of three-dimensional periodic space. By space filling is meant the packing together of closed three-dimensional bodies in an unbounded or infinite array such that ali the space is occupied without intersections of contiguous cells. The obvious question comes to the fore: with an inventory of finite polyhedra on hand, which, if any, will pack together to fi li ali space? The question has even more importance than may be immediately apparent as it must be noted from the outset that there is no limit to the number of possible space filling polyhedra. This isto emphasize that the discovery of previously unknown space filling polyhedra is of no particular significance in itself. Space filling polyhedra (old or new) only have significance in the degree to which they relate to some ordering principie. Whether such ordering principies are derived from mathematical criteria or physical constraints or both is immaterial, so longas the determining parameters are well defined. The real significance of the space filling polyhedra is therefore related to the significance of the ordering principies themselves. For the moment we are content to examine space filling possibilities within the constraints that have evolved through the historical search for ordering principies in nature and in mathematics. Hence the Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra are considered. Later in this examination some new possibilities are proposed based on parameters which have developed from the goals of the present work.<br>\n <br>\n 38<br>\n <br>\n Symmetry Classes<br>\n <br>\n The cube is the only Platonic polyhedron that will repeat to fi li ali space. lt is the most symmetrical variation on the infinite class of three-dimensional figures known as parallelepipeds. The parallelepipeds are prisms whose bases and sides arE;) parallelograms; they are, therefore, sixfaced polyhedra. Any parallelepiped will fi li space by the congruent repetition of itself [5.1 ]. The subdivision of space by means of congruent parallelepipeds may be characterized in terms of six symmetry classes or systems. These classes form six of the seven crystal systems of crystallography. The seven crystal classes rely upon various combinations of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 6-fold or no rotational symmetry; together, they provide a . descriptive scheme of space partitioning. As already mentioned, the cube is the most symmetrical case; that is, it has the greatest number of symmetry axes of any parallelepiped or parallelohedron. A cube has three axes of 4-fold symmetry, four axes of 3-fold symmetry, and six axes of 2-fold symmetry [5.2a]. This is a consequence not only of the fact that a cube's face and dihedral angles are ali equal to 90°, but also of the fact that ali of its edges are equal. lt will be noted that only the cube is metrically determinate in these seven symmetry classes; i.e., it is the only parallelepiped in which there is a unique set of dimensional relationships that cannot be varied without destroying some aspect of its symmetry. The six parallelepiped classes can be generated by making a series of systematic changes in the edge lengths and face angles of the cube while preserving only parallelism. Three sets of parai lei planes are defined by the faces of any parallelepiped. 5.1 Any paral1elepiped will fill space by repetition.<br>\n <br>\n The next most symmetrical parallelepiped class after the cube is the tetragonal system. A tetragonal parallelepiped, like the cube, is also a square prism. Ali of its face angles are 90°. lt differs from the cube in only one regard-its height will be either greater or less than its base but not equal to its base. The tetragonal system has one axis of 4-fold symmetry and four axes of 2-fold symmetry [5.2b]. In the orthorhombic system ali face angles are still 90°, but the base has two unequal sides making it a rectangle rather than a square; and the height is yet a third length. The orthorhombic system has only three 2-fold axes of symmetry [5.2c].<br>\n <br>\n The monoclinic system is nonrectangular on one set of planes, with the other two sets of planes rectangular. lt has only one 2-fold axis of symmetry [5.2d]. Although the trigonal system has no 90° angles, ali of its edges are équal and ali of its six faces are congruent. This gives rise to one 3-fold axis of symmetry making it slightly more symmetrical than the monoclinic [5.2e]. The triclinic system has no symmetry. lt has no 90° angles, and only those edges, and therefore faces, which are parallel are equal [5.2f].<br>\n <br>\n The hexagonal system is based upon the right hexagonal prism. This prism has six right parallelograms for sides and two re~ar hexagons parallel to each other on opposite ends. lt is nota parallelepiped, but is a parallelohedron because only its sides are parallelograms rather than its bases and sides. The hexagonal system has one 6-fold axis and six 2-fold axes of symmetry [5.2g]. lt is considered the most symmetrical system after the cube.* *We can rank lhe various symmetry classes by considering lhe total number of symmetry axes of each class: 1. Cubic-13 axes; 2. Hexagonal-? axes; 3. Tetragonal-5 axes; 4. Orthorhombic-3 axes; 5. Trigonal-1 axis; 6. Monoclinic-1 axis; 7. Triclinic-no symmetry axes.<br>\n <br>\n a<br>\n <br>\n c<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n e<br>\n <br>\n d<br>\n <br>\n g<br>\n <br>\n 5.2 The seven symmetry classes: cubic (a); tetragonal (b); orthorhombic (c); monoclinic (d); trigonal (e); triclinic (f); hexagonal (g).<br>\n <br>\n 39<br>\n <br>\n Symmetry Classes<br>\n <br>\n Lattices and Unit Cells In 1848 Bravais showed that there was a maximum of fourteen space lattices or groups of points differing by symmetry and geometry whose translational repetition in space maintained the symmetrical arrangements of the points of a unit cell. Bravais perceived that these fourteen space lattices corresponded to seven crystal symmetry classes.* In these seven crystal symmetry classes, the parallelepiped (or hex prism)** is the unit ce/1 or elementary repeat unit. In crystallography, a unit cell is defined as the basic repeating unit or module that, by simple translation, will define the infinite structure. Translation is a fundamental symmetry operation in which a given unit is repeated by sliding it along an axis or set of axes. Such axes are usually the set described by the edges of a given parallelepiped defined by the unit cell.<br>\n <br>\n In the cubic system, there can be an additional lattice site placed at the center of the unit cell, thus forming the body centered cubic lattice (bcc). Or, lattice sites can be placed forming the face centered cubic lattices (fcc) [5.3]. In the tetragonal system, in addition to the primitive lattice, it is only possible to have a body centered lattice. However, in the orthorhombic system three other lattices are possible in addition to the primitive. Body centered and face centered lattices are augmented by a lattice with sites added only on two opposite and parai lei faces of the unit cell. The system is usually designated C-face centered orthorhombic or simply orthorhombic-C. In the monoclinic system, only a similar C-face centered lattice appears, bringing the total number of lattices up to fourteen<br>\n <br>\n [5.4].<br>\n <br>\n When points are placed at the corners of a given unit cell, aprimitive lattice is formed. These points are called lattice sites. These lattice sites are symmetrically equivalent in the sense that they have identical surroundings or environments, i.e., each lattice site is equivalent to every other lattice site. For four of the seven primitive lattices, we can add additional points to face centers and cell body centers so that more lattices can be formed in which ali the points are symmetrically equivalent.<br>\n <br>\n Despite the fact that the unit cells and lattices are usually illustrated as parallelepipeds or parallelohedra with edges, from a crystallographer's point of view it is only the lattice sites that are of concern. There is usually no consideration of the nature of the connections between the lattice sites. Because of this the concept of.the lattice as understood by crystallographers issomewhat abstract; nevertheless, we will find that the foregoing identification of the seven crystal classes will have its role to play in our development of a morphological system for the organization of physical components in space.* The three cubic lattices-primitive, bcc, and fccare the most significant Bravais lattices in the sense that when each lattice point is connected to each of its nearest neighbors with edges, important fundamental three-dimensional networks result. Of the fourteen Bravais lattices, these cubic systems will be given the greatest emphasis in the remainder of this book. *For a discussion of the relationships between point arrays and connected networks (a polyhedron can be considered a connected network), see Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen's Chapter 11.<br>\n <br>\n 5.4 Tetragonal, trigonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic, triclinic, and hexagonallattices.<br>\n <br>\n *lt was determined by Federov (1880) and independently by Schoenflies (1891) that with the 14 Bravais lattices it was possible to generate by means of various symmetry operations \"space groups\" constituting only 230 possible symmetrical ways of arranging points in space. lt is these 230 space groups that form the heart of the analysis of crystals.

Among the Archimedean polyhedra and the infinite family of prisms and antiprisms, we find that there are exactly three space fillers: the truncated octahedron, the hexagonal prism, and the triangular prism. We are already familiar with the packings of the truncated octahedron from our discussion of the geometry of closest packed cells [1.7b]. Recai! that it isthe space filling polyhedron with the least interface area. As we have already noted, in space filling array ali of its vertices are identical, with four edges meeting at each point. The space filling triangular and hexagonal prisms are generated from the plane tessellations of triangles and hexagons [5.5]. ! Of th~ thirteen Archimedean duais, only the rhombic dodecahedron will fill ali space. lt was mentioned along with the truncated octahedron in our discussion of naturally occurring cellular structures [1. ?a]. Among the duais of the prisms and antiprisms (dipyramids and trapezohedra}, there are no space fillers. Of the class of 92 finite polyhedra bounded by regular polygons, there are also no known space fillers. Both the rhombic dodecahedron and truncated octahedron have fui I cubic symmetry [5.6]. The hexagonal prism has one axis of 6-fold symmetry and six axes of 2-fold symmetry. The triangular prism has one axis of 3-fold symmetry and three axes of 2-fold symmetry. Within this set of tive space filling polyhedra-cube, truncated octahedron, hexagonal prism, triangular prism, and rhombic dodecahedron-we find only 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold symmetry axes.<br>\n <br>\n 5.5 Space filling triangular (a) and hexagonal (b) prisms. 5.6 The rhombic dodecahedron and truncated octahedron have fui I cubic symmetry.<br>\n <br>\n B<br>\n <br>\n Symmetry is not the only factor that allows us to discover candidates for space fi li i ng. Another factor i s the com p lementarity of adjacent dihedral ang les. In a space filling array of polyhedra the dihedral angles formed by faces meeting around a common edge must sum to 360°. This is equivalent to the requirement of 360° around each vertex of a plane tessellation.<br>\n <br>\n Rhombic Dodecahedron<br>\n <br>\n Truncated Octahedron<br>\n <br>\n 2-foldaxis<br>\n <br>\n 41<br>\n <br>\n Space Filling Polyhedra<br>\n <br>\n 3-foldaxis<br>\n <br>\n 4-fold axis<br>\n <br>\n The Tetrahedron and Octahedron and Space Filling<br>\n <br>\n There is no mystery concerning the cube as a space fi Iler, but it is use fui to examine the properties of the other four regular polyhedra to see if there are clear reasons why they will not fi li space. Because the octahedron is the dual of the cube, it has the same symmetry. However, it will not fi li space. Although the symmetry is there, its dihedral angle of 109° 28' makes it impossible for the octahedron to pack with itself to occupy ali of space. We have already noted, however, that octahedra will combine with tetrahedra to forma fully triangulated network, which in tum describes a space filling array of these polyhedra. This structure is the dual network of the packing of rhombic dodecahedra and it is the lattice which positions equal spheres in closed packed array. In fact, this structure is an fcc lattice [5.3, 5.1 Oa].<br>\n <br>\n Octahedra and tetrahedra will fill space when packed in the ratio of 1:2. This is easily shown by placing tetrahedra on two opposite faces of an octahedron. The result is a space filling parallelepiped with six rhombic faces with ang les of 120° and 60° [5. 7]. lt should be noted that the tetrahedron's faces are parai lei to half of the faces of the octahedron, and this explains the ability to forma multi pie space filling system. The dihedral angle of the tetrahedron is 70°32', which is compatible with the 109°28' dihedral angle of the octahedron: combining two tetrahedra and two octahedra around a common edge accounts for 360°. The tetrahedron is less symmetrical than the octahedron (or cube). lt has four axes of 3-fold symmetry and three axes of 2-fold symmetry [5.8]. Because they are symmetrically equivalent, either the cube or the octahedron may be used to identify figures with sim i lar symmetry, i. e., the same figure may be designated as having octahedral or cubic symmetry. Because the cube is the space fi i ler, and presumably beca use it is more familiar, the term cubic symmetry is more generally used.<br>\n <br>\n The lcosahedron and Dodecahedron and Space Filling<br>\n <br>\n The icosahedron and the dodecahedron are dual to each other so they have the same symmetry. The icosahedron is the most symmetrical of ali possible polyhedra. lt is mathematically and physically impossible to describe or construct a polyhedron of higher symmetry. The icosahedron has twenty equilateral triangular faces. There is no convex polyhedron with more than twenty identical regular faces. A triangular face may be divided into six congruent right triangles. When this is done on each face of the icosahedron, a polyhedron can be derived which has 120 congruent faces. This is the greatest number of identical modules which can be used to form a closed polyhedron. The icosahedron becomes, therefore, the most symmetrical system for the subdivision of a spherical surface into modular units. As I pointed out in Chapter 2 it is this property of high symmetry that Fui ler has exploited with his geodesic domes and which many vírus structures take advantage of. However, this high symmetry makes it impossible to fi li space with an icosahedron. * *Coxeter, DuVal, and Petrie have shown that the icosahedron can generate 59 stellated forms dueto its high symmetry. No other polyhedron can generate that many derivativa forms.<br>\n <br>\n 5.7 Two tetrahedra and one octahedron combine to forma space filling parallelipiped. 5.8 Symmetry axes of the regular tetrahedron: four 3-fold axes and three 2-fold axes.<br>\n <br>\n 42<br>\n <br>\n Symmetry and Space Filling<br>\n <br>\n The icosahedron has the following axes of symmetry: six 5-fold axes, ten 3-fold axes, and fifteen 2-fold axes [5.9]. Since the dodecahedron is the dual of the icosahedron, it has the same symmetry. We note that these two figures have six axes of 5-fold symmetry. lt has already been shown in the discussion of plane tessellations that regular pentagons cannot be combined to fi li the plane. Only figures with 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold symmetry can subdivide space. In spite of the fact that the pentagonal dodecahedron appears as if it might fi li space, it will not quite do it. lts face angles are 108° (very close to the tetrahedral angles of 109°28'), and its dihedral angles are 116°34' (which is close to the 120° angle found in plane tessellations). The fact that the icosahedron and dodecahedron have elements of 2-fold and 3-fold symmetry suggests that they may have some capability of spatial periodicity, if not complete space filling. Such questions are explored Iater, along with distortions of these two figure~, made in order to accomplish at least approximate space filling.<br>\n <br>\n Regular and Semiregular Polyhedra as Multiple Space Fillers A multiple space filling system is one in which thereis more than one kind of polyhedron. As we have just seen, among the tive Platonic polyhedra, the only multi pie space filling system is one composed of tetrahedra and octahedra. However, there are also multiple space filling systems which utilize, in various combinations, both the regular and semi regular polyhedra. The first requirement of multiple space filling is that different polyhedra must have matching parai lei faces in common. With this in mind, it becomes readily apparent that the semi regular duais do not qualify, as no two figures have the same faces in common. Of the thirteen Archimedean figures, six are derived from the icosahedron and consequently have fui I icosahedral symmetry which disqualifies them, even from multi pie space filling systems. Of the remaining seven, one-the truncated tetrahedron-has tetrahedral symmetry and the other sixcuboctahedron, truncated octahedron, truncated cube, rhombicuboctahedron, truncated cuboctahedron, and snub cuboctahedron-have fui I cubic symmetry. Of these six, the snub cuboctahedron has extra faces which are not parailei to the faces of any of the others. lt is, therefore, disqualified.<br>\n <br>\n 5.9 Symmetry of the icosahedron and its dual, the pentagonal dodecahedron.<br>\n <br>\n 2-foldaxis<br>\n <br>\n 3-fold axis<br>\n <br>\n 43<br>\n <br>\n Of the Archimedean and Platonic figures, then, there are altogether nine polyhedra that qualify as candidates for multip le space filling systems. In the larger class of semiregular polyhedra, which includes the prisms as well as the Archimedean figures, a look at the semiregular plane tessellations reveals which of the prisms will qualify for multiple space filling. We have already seen that triang les, squares, hexagons, octagons, and dodecagons are the only polygons that can combine in various arrangements to form plane tessellations [4.1]. Any polygon can be used for the ends of a right prism, and if ali the sides are taken to be squares, we have a collection of semiregular polyhedra. (The cube, of course, is regular.) From this, it follows that triangular, hexagonal, octagonal, and dodecagonal prisms qualify as candidates for multiple space filling systems. Further, the eight semi regular tessellations can be considered multiple space filling systems which combine up to three different cell shapes, e.g., cube, hexagonal prism, and dodecagonal prism. Recai I that the semi regular tessellations have ali their vertices congruent and that if this requirement is waived, there can be an infinite number of plane tessellations composed of regular polygons. The same principie holds with the space filling prisms, i.e., there is an infinite number of multiple systems once the requirement of congruent vertices is abandoned. In the interest of simplicity we will only consider the uniform cases on the assumption that the most interesting nonuniform permutations are derived from them.<br>\n <br>\n tcosahedron<br>\n <br>\n We can classify multiple space filling systems according to how many different types of polyhedra the systems require. A space filling system consisting of one type of polyhedron is c.alled a unary space filling system. Multi pie systems consisting of two, three, and four types of polyhedra are called binary, ternary, and quaternary space fi lling systems, respectively.*<br>\n <br>\n Dodecahedron<br>\n <br>\n *I have discovered no system composed exclusively of regular and semi regular figures that utilizes more than four types of polyhedra.<br>\n <br>\n 5-foldaxis<br>\n <br>\n Regular and Semiregular Polyhedra<br>\n <br>\n In addition to the eight multiple-prism (from the semi regular tessellations) space filling systems, there are eleven more space filling possibilities utilizing the Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra. These eleven are shown in [5.1 O].* These range from the binary tetrahedral I octahedral system to the quaternary system composed of the rhombicuboctahedron, octagonal prism, truncated cube, and cube. Unlike the multiple prism packings, these systems do not give ri se to infinite numbers of space filling permutations. There is a simple reason for this. Only the cube, out of the nine polyhedra in this class, can be repeated to forma larger version of itself. In the case of the prism forms (including the cube again) of the five qualifying polyhedra, both the cube (square prism) and the triangular prism wi li repeat to form larger versions of themselves, and the triangular prism can also be placed to form hexagonal prisms. In summary, the five qualifying prisms give ri se to an infinite number of possible space filling permutations. This is consiqtent with the general nature of the prism · class of semiregular figures since there are an infinite number of finite prisms. The Archimedean polyhedra compose a finite class, and we find that their high symmetry limits the inventory of space filling possi bi lities. In order to set limits on the number of space filling prism systems, the requirement was established that ali vertices in the array must be congruent. Now, in the case of the finite set of eleven multi pie space filling systems which are composed of various combinations of the Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, ali vertices are congruent. Thus, ali of the space filling systems we have so far mentioned (which total 23 cases) consisting of regular and semiregular polyhedra, including the unary systems and the prism family, can be considered to be uniform structures since in each system ali vertices are equally surrounded by the same number of edges. This uniformity has important consequences for the reciproca! space filling arrangements (dual nets) of these 23 space filling systems .. *Andreini was lhe first to enumerate these.<br>\n <br>\n 5.1 O Space filling by combinations of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra.<br>\n <br>\n Dual Space Filling The concept of the dual network or recíproca! space fíllíng has been defíned ín Chapter 1. In revíew, ít ís formed by connectíng the centers of each polyhedron ín a space fíllíng array to ali neíghbors wíth whích ít shares a common face. lt follows from the defínítíon that íf ali vertíces ín a space fíllíng array are congruent (uníform), the dual network wíll forma unary space fíllíng system composed of a síngle kínd of polyhedron. Such a polyhedron has also been descríbed as a domaín of a vertex ín Chapter 1 (pp. 8-9). lf there ís more than one kínd of vertex ín a space fíllíng structure, íts dual space fíllíng wíll be composed of as many dífferent kínds of polyhedra as there are dífferent kínds of vertíces.<br>\n <br>\n a.

However, three of these original 23 uníform systems have dual space fíllíng systems whích are also comprísed of regular or semíregular polyhedra. Whíle the dual of a síngle cube ís an octahedron, the space fíllíng of cubes ís a self-dual and ís the only such case. n. TrirectangularDipyramid<br>\n <br>\n The triangular prísm and the hexagonal prísm space fíllíng systems are dual to each other. Therefore, only 20 new polyhedra are formed wíth the dual space fíllíng systems. Actually one of these ís already famílíar as the domaín of the dual network of the tetrahedral I octahedral system: namely the rhombíc dodecahedron, the only Archímedean dual polyhedron that wíll fíll space. lt ís both a fíníte dual polyhedron and the domaín of an ínfíníte dual space fíllíng system. Subtractíng the rhombíc dodecahedron then, there are stíll19 space fíllíng polyhedra whích have not been díscussed. These are í llustrated ín [5.11].

These space filling systems must be oriented to the triangular net. This explains the necessity of the orthorhombic prism, which is a replacement for the square prism (cube), in those space filling systems which conventionally incorporate triangular, hexagonal, and/or dodecagonal prisms in combination with the cube.<br>\n <br>\n Figure [ 6.5] shows closest packed spheres generating the truncated octahedron and a corresponding similarly oriented model showing the tetrahedral/ octahedral network of equi lateral triangles, which also generates the truncated octahedron. Figure [6.6] shows a similar set of spheres generating the truncated cuboctahedron.<br>\n <br>\n The fact that ali of these polyhedra can be classified in terms of closest packed spheres is remarkable, even granting that subtle metric problems remain. Ali of the symmetry properties of the polyhedra are preserved, except for the octagonal prism and dodecagonal prism, which here have lower symmetry than their semi regular counterparts. The closest packing of spheres serves to show the interrelatedness of the various systems. lt demonstrates an array of orderly permutations of a •simple overall system. Since ali the vertices of tetrahedra and octahedra in a space filling array correspond to centers of closest packed spheres, any of the vertices of the polyhedra classified in Table 6.1 can also be defined by the vertices in the tetrahedral/ octahedral space fi lling. Beca use of the usefulness of triangulated structures, this becomes a tantalizing bit of knowledge.<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n 6.6 A closest packing of spheres (a), and a tetrahedral/octahedral network, both ofwhich generate the truncated cuboctahedron (b).<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n 6.5 A clósest packing of spheres (a), anda tetrahedral/octahedral network, both of which generate the truncated octahedron (b).<br>\n <br>\n 59<br>\n <br>\n Spheres as Morphological Units<br>\n <br>\n In Table 6.1 only the minimum number of generating spheres has been given for each polyhedron. lt is possible, of course, to closest pack spheres to form any of these same polyhedra with large numbers of spheres along each edge. Fuller has shown this with his concentric sphere packing (Marks). For example, exactly twelve spheres will pack concentrically around a center sphere forming the vertices of the cuboctahedron (No. 5, Cubic System, Table 6.1; see also [1.3a]. Additional concentric layers of spheres may be indefinitely packed around this same nucleus resulting in larger and larger cuboctahedra [6.7]*<br>\n <br>\n The cuboctahedron is the only polyhedron of the regular and semiregular figures that can be formed from a concentric packing of spheres. This concentric structure also yields a modified cuboctahedron which is twisted 60° on one equatorial plane [6.8]. This configuration arises out of hexagonal closest packing, and defines a shape of less symmetry than the cuboctahedron defined by cubic closest packed spheres. lt is the triangular orthobicupola of [5.12]. 6.8 The triangular orthobicupola is a hexagonal closest packed structure.<br>\n <br>\n *Fuller has shown that the number of spheres on each successive layer is given by 1On 2 + 2, where n is the number of the layer (or the number of intervals between spheres on a given edge, as this will always correspond to the number of the layer). Fuller refers to this modular incrementation as the frequency of the system.<br>\n <br>\n Justas the rhombic dodecahedron is the domain of the cubic closest packing, the trapezorhombic dodecahedron is the domain of hexagonal closest packing. Other polyhedra can be built up in various ways-the tetrahedron, for example, grows by addition of additional layers of packed spheres to one face only. This isshown in [6.9]. That larger polyhedra can be built up from equal spheres means that tetrahedra and octahedra may also be accumulated to yield larger and larger polyhedra. The implications of this, when combi ned with the inherent triangulation of these systems, are examined !ater in the book. An appreciation of the packing properties of tetrahedra and octahedra is the basis of a spatial sensibility which enables optimum use of the principie of triangulation for architectural structures. The dual space filling systems are absent from Table 6.1. Ali of these systems can be classified according to the closest packing of spheres; however, this does not prove to be very convenient. For example, it takes a minimum of 93 spheres to form the vertices of the rhombic dodecahedron, and even at that, the rhombic faces are not well illu;:;trated. In general, the sphere packing system is cumbersome, if not altogether ineffective, for classifying the polyhedra of the dual nets. This is particularly true of the cubic system.<br>\n <br>\n 6. 7 Generating cuboctahed ra by the concentric closest packing of spheres (after Fuller).<br>\n <br>\n One Frequé.ncy<br>\n <br>\n 6.9 Enlarging the tetrahedron by adding layers of spheres to one face.<br>\n <br>\n Two Frequency<br>\n <br>\n Three Frequency<br>\n <br>\n 60<br>\n <br>\n Toward a Morphological System<br>\n <br>\n Although ou r concern has been the classification of those regular and semi regular polyhedra which are components of space filling systems, the icosahedron has some interesting properties in relation to sphere packing that should not go unnoticed. Fuller has pointed out that if the center sphere of a 13-sphere cuboctahedral array is allowed to \"shrink\" in diameter, the twelve outer spheres shift into a new contracted position to form the twelve vertices of the icosahedron. This constitutes the most symmetrical distribution of spheres closest packed around a common center point [6.10a].<br>\n <br>\n However, this system is not capable of repeating itself in concentric layers as is the cuboctahedron packing. Single shells of spheres can be formed with any arbitrarily large number of spheres along each edge of the icosahedron, but they cannot form concentric contiguous layers of spheres. lf ali spheres are equal, twenty planar triangular arrays are formed corresponding to the twenty triangular faces of the icosahedron [6.1 Ob,c].* *A variation of the equation that accounts for the number of spheres in the outer shell of the cuboctahedron also accounts for the number of spheres on the outer icosahedral shell. This may be written as 10(m-1) 2 + 2, where m is here the number of spheres along each edge of the icosahedron. This packing principie of the icosahedron is closely related to the structure of the Fui ler (1969a) geodesic domes and, as Horne and others have observed, to the structure of certain viruses (Horne 1963a; Horne and Wildy).<br>\n <br>\n 6.10 Twelve spheres packed around a point form the icosahedron (a); and twenty planar triangular arrays of spheres around a point form the 20 faces of the icosahedron shell (b, c).<br>\n <br>\n a<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n 61<br>\n <br>\n c<br>\n <br>\n Spheres as Morphological Units<br>\n <br>\n Limitations of Spheres as Morphological Units<br>\n <br>\n The sphere packing approach is quite an effective morphological accounting system, but it does have limitations. Although we know that the centers of spheres can be joined to form an equilateral triangular network, the sphere itself has no finite characteristic symmetry that can be related to the discrete geometric relationships and finite symmetries that ou r polyhedron exhibit lt has an infinite number of symmetry axes of infinite-fold rotational symmetry; it is simply toa symmetrical. In fact, as far as periodic arrangements in three-dimensional space are concerned, the sphere itself can be considered an amorphous (shapeless) element. The interconnections that join the sphere centers to define the edges of various polyhedra classified by sphere packings are after ali, only imaginary constructions. Even though their positions and direction are determined by the manner in which spheres must assoei ate in closest packing, there is still much interpreting to do.<br>\n <br>\n 6.11 The rhombic dodecahedron as a morphological unit: cubic closest packing.<br>\n <br>\n Tetrahedron Truncated Tetrahedron<br>\n <br>\n Rhombicuboctahedron<br>\n <br>\n Cube<br>\n <br>\n Octahedron<br>\n <br>\n Truncated Cube<br>\n <br>\n Tetragonal Prism<br>\n <br>\n Truncated Octahedron<br>\n <br>\n Cuboctahedron Truncated Cuboctahedron<br>\n <br>\n Octagonal Prism<br>\n <br>\n 6.12 The trapezorhom bic dodecahed ron as a morphological unit: hexagonal closest packing.<br>\n <br>\n I<br>\n <br>\n '<br>\n <br>\n ' '<br>\n <br>\n Triangular Prism (A)<br>\n <br>\n Triangular Prism (B)<br>\n <br>\n Hexagonal Prism (B)<br>\n <br>\n 62<br>\n <br>\n Toward a Morphological System<br>\n <br>\n Orthorhombic Prism<br>\n <br>\n Hexagonal Prism (A)<br>\n <br>\n Dodecagonal Prism<br>\n <br>\n Polyhedra as Morphological Units<br>\n <br>\n lf we are to have a morphological basis for modular structure, we must be able to account specifically for ali of the components-the interconnections as well as the vertices. Our morphological units in and of themselves must account for specific angular relationships, which the spheres do not provide in any direct way. We must find an at0mic or morphological unit which is defined inherently in terms of its relationships to the whole, so that its very shape predicts the manner of its association with other like forms. Because the rhombic dodecahedron is the doma in of the sphere in closest packed array, it may be considered as an alternative morphological unit. But, to cover ali cases arising from sphere packil')g, it must be paired with the trapezorhombic dodecahedron. Then, the first figure will serve as the morphological unit for structures based upon cubic closest packing; and the second (which is the dual of the triangular orthobicupola), for systems based upon hexagonal closest packing [6.11, 6.12]. With this we see that relatively subtle differances of geometric relationships, e.g., cubic vs. hexagonal closest packing, can be differentiated (perhaps even predicted) by the inherent limitations given by the shape of particular morphological units. The sites of the'fcc lattice correspond to the centers of spheres in cubic closest packing (see p. 40). Therefore, the rhombic dodecahedron is also the domain of the fcc lattice. Similarly, the truncated octahedron is the domain of the bcc l(l.ttice. We, have also seen that the dual riet of space filling truncated octahedra is the space filling of tetragonal disphenoids which forms a fully triangulated net with vertex coordination of fourteen. Remember that the crystallographic lattices are not concerned with the interconnections of points in space, but only with relative point locations defined in terms of symmetry. The tetragonal disphenoid array is formed when both nearest and next nearest neighbors are connected from each point in the bcc lattice, which explains how these structures are related.<br>\n <br>\n 63<br>\n <br>\n The truncated octahedron can also be considered a morphological unit. We have seen that twelve spheres (or rhombic dodecahedra) can be packed around a center sphere (or rhombic dodecahedron), forming the twelve vertices of the cuboctahedron. The truncated octahedron exhibits similar behavior. lf truncated octahedra are placed on the fourteen faces of a nuclear truncated octahedron, their centers form the fourteen vertices of the rhombic dodecahedron. Concentric layers may be added and each new layer reveals still a larger rhombic dodecahedron. * The rhombic dodecahedron is itself a dual space filling polyhedron. This suggests that truncated octahedron packings may be able to account, at least to some degree, for some of the other dual space filling polyhedra. A few dual space fillings can be accounted for by packings of truncated octahedra; however, the bulk of these polyhedra are difficult to organize with the truncated octahedron as the morphological unit. The regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and cube can also be formed by combining truncated octahedra; however, the truncated octahedron does not serve very well as an accounting system for the more complex figures. For example, it takes 80 truncated octahedra to define a single larger truncated octahedron, whereas it takes only 38 spheres to define the same figure. Space filling polyhedra are morphological units of more specific geometric content than spheres. For example, the rhombic dodecahedron and the trapezorhombic dodecahedron of themselves reveal the differences between cubic closest packing and hexagonal closest packing. The rhombic dodecahedron has fui I cubic symmetry, while the trapezorhombic dodecahedron has only one axis of 3-fold symmetry and three axes of 2-fold symmetry. The truncated octahedron also has fui I cubic symmetry; but its faces have no planes in common with the rhombic dodecahedron and, therefore, its packing arrangement is different. *The number of truncated octahedra on each layer is given by the equation 12n 2 + 2, where n is the number of the layer. The first layer has 14 truncated octahedra, the second has 50, the third has 11 O, etc. This equation was reported by J. W. Marvin (1939a).<br>\n <br>\n Polyhedra as Morphological Units<br>\n <br>\n Since, as morphological units, the rhombic dodecahedron and truncated octahedron can generate a variety of different polyhedra in the cubic system, perhaps a morphological unit could be derived which would combine the properties of both figures. Such a combination may provide a basis for a more integrative morpholog ical system. lf we are to pursue this line of thought, it will be necessary (at least temporarily) to abandon the hexagonal system, i.e., trapezorhombic dodecahedron packings. With the hexagonal system set aside, is it possible to develop a universal morphological system which can account for ali of the figures which comprise the various space filling polyhedra of the cubic system? The space filling nets of both the truncated octahedron and rhombic dodecahedron are fully triangulated. For the former, the dual net consists of congruent isosceles triang les, and for the latter, it consists of congruente qui lateral triangles. The fact that both of the polyhedra have cubic symmetry suggests that the dual nets might be related in some simple way to each other.<br>\n <br>\n To review the symmetry involved: cubic symmetry is that of three axes of 4-fold symmetry, four axes of 3-fold symmetry, and six axes of 2-fold symmetry. In the space filiing net of tetrahedra and octahedra, each vertex has a coordination of twelve corresponding to the twelve faces of the rhombic dodecahedron which forms the dual net. This rhombic dodecahedron is a domain in the sense that as the space filiing dual of the tetrahedral/ octahedral system, it accounts for the discrete geometrical and symmetrical arrangements which define the typical vertex. The edges of the network emanating from the center of the rhombic dodecahedron pass through the centers of each face andare perpendicular to the faces [6.13]. These edges are equivalent to the six axes of 2-fold rotational symmetry of the cube.<br>\n <br>\n The truncated octahedron is the domain of the tetragonal disphenoidal space filiing network. Each vertex in this structure isalikejoined byfourteenedges. When these fourteen edges emanate fromthe center of the truncated octahedron, six pass perpendicularly through the centers of the six square faces and eight pass perpendicularly through the centers of the eight hexagonal faces [ 6.14]. The six edges are directed along the three 4-fold axes of the cube and the eight edges are directed along the four 3-fold axes of the cube. 6.14 The truncated octahedron is the domain of the 14-connected tetragonal d isphenoid network.<br>\n <br>\n 6.13 The rhombic dodecahedron is the doma in of the 12-connected tetrahedral/octahedral network.<br>\n <br>\n Thus, there are three sets of planes which are perpendicular to the three sets of symmetry axes of the cube. These three sets are calied cube, octahedron, and dodecahedron planes. They are paraliel to the faces of the cube, octahedron, and rhombic dodecahedron, respectively [6.15]. The cleavage planes ofthe cu,bic closest packing of spheres correspond to these planes. lt is significant that for ali of the polyhedra of tetrahedral or cubic symmetry which com pose space filiing systems, the faces are paraliel to one or more of the three sets of cubic planes and this includes ali of the dual space filiers. The rhombic dodecahedron's faces are paraliel to only one set of planes, while the truncated octahedron has faces parailei to the cube planes, as weli as to the octahedron planes. Among the semiregular polyhedra, only the rhombicuboctahedron and the truncated cuboctahedron incorporate ali three planes. Neither of these polyhedra wili fi li space alone, and, therefore, it is impossible to forma space filiing morphological unit which combines ali three planes. 6.15 The cubic planes: cube (a), octahedron (b), and dodecahedron planes (c).<br>\n <br>\n c<br>\n <br>\n 64<br>\n <br>\n Toward a Morphological System<br>\n <br>\n Morphological Networks<br>\n <br>\n Abstraction and Built Form: The Morphological Node and Branches<br>\n <br>\n We have seen that the edges of the tetrahedral I octahedral network plus the tetragonal disphenoidal network include ali of the symmetry axes of the cube. Since we cannot represent these directions with a single space filling morphological unit, perhaps a more versatile and visceral morphological scheme could be derived by way of a morpho/ogica/ network. lt may be possible to form a network which can incorporate ali three types of cubic axes in one system, perhaps a universal cubic network in which the elements of1 position and direction can be concretized as bui lt form. lf we consider ali of the thirteen symmetry axes of the cube passing through the center of the cube, a vertex is formed in which 26 edges meet [6.16]. Of the 26 edges originating from this vertex, six are directed toward the centers of the cube faces, eight are directed toward the corners of the cube, and twelve are directed toward the midpoints of the edges. The same 26 directions may be derived from the octahedron because of its duality with the cube. lf the 26 edges originate from the center of the octahedron, six are directed toward the vertices, eight are directed toward the faces, and, as in the cube, twelve are directed toward the midpoints ofthe edges [6.17].<br>\n <br>\n 6.16 Twenty-six edges originating from the center ofthe cube (symmetry axes of the cube). 6.17 Twenty-six edges originating from the center of the octahed ron (symmetry axes of cube = symmetry axes of octahedron).<br>\n <br>\n 8oth the rhombicuboctahedron and the truncated cuboctahedron have 26 faces which are perpendicular to the directions of the aforementioned 26 edges. When the edges originate from the center of either of these polyhedra they are directed towards the centers of each face. These are the only semiregular polyhedra in which this is true. These two polyhedra are the only ones which incorporate ali three sets of cubic planes; it is not surprising, then, that they have this relationship to the 26 edges. We may consider either of these polyhedra to be the domain of a 26-connected network; however, we have already noted that neither of these polyhedra can fi li space alone. This suggests that it is not possible to form a uniform network in which every node is equally joined by 26 edges. lt will be shown Iater that for every 26-connected vertex, exactly three 6-connected vertices are required.<br>\n <br>\n 65<br>\n <br>\n Abstraction and Built Form<br>\n <br>\n The concept of symmetry axes is relatively abstract. In the rest of this chapter I will expand on the concretization of this concept, so as to reduce the abstraction of symmetry to catalogable, buildable form. The notions of \"vertex\" and \"edge\" are also abstract, although to a lesser degree than that of symmetry axes. lt is easy enough to visualize hard spheres or polyhedra as physical units or modules. The idea of vertex and edge needs to be given in a similarly concrete form. lf we are to define vertices and edges in terms of specific physical form, we must find edge and vertex morphological units that embody the appropriate geometry and symmetry. We have seen that the doma in of the 26connected vertex is either the rhombicuboctahedron or the truncated cuboctahedron. Perhaps one of these could be viewed as a vertex with a set of complementary edges with cross-sectional shapes that would match faces on the polyhedral domain. At this point, it will be useful to adopt some new terminology. Vertices, actually built as specific physical entities, shall be designated as nades, and built physical edges shall be called branches.<br>\n <br>\n A framework consisting of 26 cubes placed around a central cube can be used to generate a rhombicuboctahedron of proportions particularly well suited for use as our morphological nade. Figure [6.18a] shows such an array of cubes in which the octahedron planes are placed in the eight corner cubes. Dodecahedron planes are placed in the twelve cubes which li e between pairs of corner cubes, and the six cubes at the centers of each side contain simple cube planes. Thus the rhombicuboctahedron is bounded by six square faces, eight triangular faces, and twelve rectangular faces. Because of the rectangular faces it does not strictly qualify as a semiregular polyhedron, but the individual faces and the rotation axes to which they are perpendicular have the same n-fold rotational symmetries. That is, the rectangular faces have 2-fold rotational symmetry and they are perpendicular to the six axes of 2-fold symmetry; the triangular faces have 3-fold rotational symmetry and are perpendicular to the four axes of 3-fold symmetry, and the square faces with 4-fold symmetry are . perpendicular to the three axesof 4-fold symmetry.<br>\n <br>\n The specially proportioned rhombicuboctahedron is then the ideal form for our morphological node. * lts square, triangular, and rectangular faces serve to identify the character of the morphological branches that must meet at this node. Secause there are three sets of symmetry axes there must be three different branches. The rhombicuboctahedron accounts for these three branches with its three faces and dictates that the branches have cross-sectional shapes which correspond in symmetry to the axes they represent. Therefore, the branches will have rectangular, triangular and square cross sections corresponding to 2-, 3-, and 4-fold symmetry axes respectively [6.18b]. A most interesting fact may now be noted. The branch of triangular cross-section must be twisted along its symmetry axis exactly 60° so that when two rhombicuboctahedral morphological nades are joined by a 3-fold branch they are properly oriented to each other. lf a nontwisted 3-fold branch is used the nades become cubically disoriented. Here we have a manifestation of a subtle and fundamental difference between cubic symmetry and hexagonal symmetry. With the nontwisted branch it is possible, in combination with the twisted triangular branch, to build certain hexagonal structures.<br>\n <br>\n The Physical Model System<br>\n <br>\n In orderto facilitate the empirical exploration and assembly of various modular networks, I have developed a model system. lt is based on the foregoing morphological node and is shown in [6.19].* The model system consists of a molded plasc tic node and extruded plastic brancrres. The node is our specially proportioned rhombicuboctahedron with 26 spokes emanating from its faces: six square spokes, eight triangular spokes, and twelve rectangular spokes. There is a set of three branch types corresponding in cross-sectional shape to the spokes on the node. The branches are hollow and are designed so they will just friction-fit around the proper spoke. The node, including its spokes, of [6.19] is 1.25 inches in diameter. *This system is protected by U.S. Patent 3600825 \"Synthesized Natural Geometric Structures\" and six additional patents in Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, ltaly, and Japan.<br>\n <br>\n *Aithough the truncated cuboctahedron has 26 faces, ali of these faces do not reflect the symmetry of the rotation axes to which they are normal. For example, it has hexagonal faces perpendicular to the 3-fold octahedral axis and octagon faces perpendicular to the 4fold axes.<br>\n <br>\n 6.19 Morphological nade connectors and branches.<br>\n <br>\n a<br>\n <br>\n b 6.18 Cubic planes generate rhombicuboctahedral envelope of morphological nade (a); cross sections of morphological branches having 4-, 2-, and 3-fold symmetry (b).<br>\n <br>\n 66<br>\n <br>\n Toward a Morphological System<br>\n <br>\n Since the spokes on the node and the branches are shaped accordi ng to the symmetry of the rotation axes they represent, when networks are assembled, no matter how randomly, the nodes always remain properly oriented with respect to one another. In orderto achieve the twist in the threefold branch mentioned above, it is necessary to provi de a three-fold splice which incorporates the 60° twist. When two short lengths are joined to each end of the splice, a properly twisted 3-fold branch results. This twist can also be an integral part of aone-piece molded branch. · This physical model system embodies principies of symmetrywhich govern · modular order in three-dimensional space, and it makes such principies accessible to direct sensory experience. This system is a sophisticated \"Tinker Toy\" with which we can study modular systems as physicogeometrical constructions rather than analytical, algebraic abstractions.<br>\n <br>\n The Universal Network and the Universal Node System<br>\n <br>\n I have already hinted at the possibility of a universal cubic network (p. 65). We now move toward the realization of that ideal with the just-described universal cubic node. In the interest of brevity I shall reter to this as the Universal Node.®* The Universal Node connector, with its 26 spokes, has fui I cubic symmetry. Figure [6.20] shows three views of the node along each of the symmetry axes. In order to fully realize a universal cubic network it is necessary to establish not only the characteristic node and the cross sections of the corresponding branches but the relative !engths of the branches as well. *The term Universal Nade is a registered trade mark of Synestructics, Inc.<br>\n <br>\n A convenient notation for identifying the three branches can be borrowed from crystallography in which points, vector directions and crystal planes are established in terms of an x, y, z (rectangular) coordinate system. Set eight cubes as octants surrounding the origin x = y = z = O of a coordinate system. Because only signs change in the various octants of the coordinate system, and not the distances to corresponding points, it is only necessary to consider the octant in which ali the values are positive, i.e., the upper right top quadrant. The coordinates are those of the point toward which a given vector is directed from the origin. The cube edges emanating from the origin (the lower left rear corner of the cube) have the following coordinates: x = +1, y =O, z =O; x = O, y = + 1, z = O; and x = O, y = O, z = + 1 [6.21a]. The coordinates of these points may be abbreviated as 100, 01 O, 001, keeping in mind that the numbers are always in x,y,z order. The direction indices or the vector directions to these points (i.e., the set of three vector components that wi li carry one from the origin to the points) are enclosed in square brackets: [1 00], [01 O], [001]. The Miller indices of any plane have the coordinates of the direction to which the plane is perpendicular. To distinguish thern from vector directions, the Miller índices of a plane are placed in curved brackets. The planes (faces) perpendicular to the [100], [010], and [110] directionswould be indicated as: (1 00), (01 0), and (001 ).<br>\n <br>\n 6.20 Symmetry axes of the Universal Nade connector.<br>\n <br>\n 3-fold axis<br>\n <br>\n 2-fold axis<br>\n <br>\n 4-fold axis<br>\n <br>\n 6.21 Various points x, y, z on the cube in the first octant of a rectangular coordinate system. The direction indices of these points are denoted by [x y z]. Shown are the cube edges (a), face diagonais (b), and body diagonal (c).<br>\n <br>\n z<br>\n <br>\n z<br>\n <br>\n z<br>\n <br>\n origin<br>\n <br>\n a<br>\n <br>\n 67<br>\n <br>\n X<br>\n <br>\n Abstraction and Built Forrn<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n X<br>\n <br>\n c<br>\n <br>\n X<br>\n <br>\n The direction índices of the octant face diagonais starting from the originare [110], [101], and [011] (see [6.21b]). There is only one body diagonal emanating from the origin into the first octant; its direction índices are [111] (see [6.21 c]). Only the signs change when we write the direction índices for the edge, face and body directions for the other octants. When ali of the sign combinations and permutations are combined with ali possible triplets of O and 1, ali 26 directions of the Universal Node connector will have been accounted for. Because, up to sign changes, there are only three unique sets of coordinate combinations, we may reter to each set simply as the [100], [110], and [111] directions. We wi li henceforth designate ou r three branches accordingly: cube edge direction, [100] branch; cube face diagonal direction [110] branch; and cube body diagonal direction, .[ 111] branch.<br>\n <br>\n When they are in their proper dual relationship, the nodes of the rhombic dodecahedral array fali at the centers of every tetrahedron and octahedron with the nades of the tetrahedral/octahedral array at the centers of the rhombic dodecahedra. These nodes may be connected to each other in sue h a way that a superimposition of tetrahed ral/ octahed rai and tetragonal disphenoidal arrays are formed. This gives rise to a network consisting of both 26- and 14-connected nades and the inadvertent appearance of 4-connected nades where [ 100] and [ 11 O] branches cross each other. A model ofthis network is seen in [6.22]. The model is seen to be in the form of a truncated octahedron.<br>\n <br>\n The edge length ratios of the branches are obtained by means of the Pythagorean theorem. lf the cube edge is A units long, then the face diagonal is AV2 units long, and the body diagonal AV3 units. We will see that various multiples of these ratios account for ali of the edges that appear in the space fi lling inventory of the cubic system in Table 5.1. lt is important to note, however, that these are ratios of the distance between nodal centers and not to the actual lengths of the branches, which, dueto the necessary bulk of the nodes, will be somewhat shorter depending on the radii of the nades.<br>\n <br>\n 6.22 Tetrahedral/octahedral and tetragonal disphenoid arrays combine to forma network of 26/14/4-connected nodes. 6.23 The universal network. Note the 26- and 6-connected nades here and in the following figure.<br>\n <br>\n We can now proceed to the development of a universal network that combines the tetrahedral/octahedral space filling net with the tetragonal disphenoidal space filling net. The tetragonal disphenoidal network can be derived from the tetrahedral/octahedral network and vice versa. In this respect, it is useful to consider the relationship of the tetrahedral/ octahedral network (composed of [110] branches) superimposed on its dual rhombic dodecahedral network (composed of [ 111] branches).<br>\n <br>\n 68<br>\n <br>\n The 26-connected nades are formed at the 12-connected nodes of the tetrahedral/octahedral array where the 14 add itional branches o f the tetragonal d isphenoid network meet. The additional 14-connected nades of the 26-, 14-, and 4-connected network are at the centers of the rhombic dodecahedra. We may açjd 12 more [110] branchestothese 14connected nodes so that they are also 26-connected. When this is done the 4-connected nades become 6-connected as the new [ 11 O] branches cross the intersection ofthe original [100] and [110] branches. lt is impossible to forma network consisting entirely of 26-connected nodes. For every 26-connected nade, there must be three 6-connected nodes. This network is shown in [6.23] and [6.24]. The important thing is that both the 4- and 6-connected nodes are subsets of the Universal Node. In the forme r, the branches are attached to two spokes in the appropriate [ 100] directions and two spokes in the appropriate [ 11 O] directions [6.25], while in the latter, the branches are still attached to two spokes in the [100] directions but now have four [110] directions [6.26].<br>\n <br>\n Toward a Morphological System<br>\n <br>\n 6.24 Detail of the universal network. 6.25 Four-connected subset of Universal Node connectorwith two [110] and two [100] branches. 6.26 Six-connected subset of Universal Node connector with four [11 O] and two [1 00] branches.<br>\n <br>\n We see from this construction that the respective typical nodes of the tetrahedral/ octahedral [6.27] and tetragonal disphenoidal [6.28] systems are also subsets of the Universal Node connector. Further examination shows that the characteristic vertices of ali of the polyhedral space filling systems consisting of regular and semiregular polyhedra of the cubic system are subsets of the Universal Node. The vertices of ali the individual polyhedra which com pose these space filling systems maytherefore also be considered subsets of the Universal Node connector. Ali of the edges of these space filling nets or individual polyhedra are various combinations of [ 100] and [ 11 O] branches. What is even more remarkable is that a// of the space filling nets which are dual to the systems composed of regular and semiregular polyhedra may be assembled from Universal Node connectors and various combinations of [100], [ 11 O], and [ 111] branches. Note that [ 111] branches on ly appear in the dual nets. The network consisting of 26- and 6-connectednodes[a23]and[a24]canbe considered to be the universal cubic network in which ali of the cubic space filling systems and their dual nets exist simultaneously in a single construct. Any given space filling network is then a subset of this universal network. The interrelatedness of ali these systems is manifested in a minimum inventory of morphological component types which can be assembled into a vast array of diverse structures. Not only do the various plane faced polyhedral systems appear as subsets of the universal network, but a very large class of uniform and semiuniform* periodic networks not composed of plane faced polyhedra are also included.<br>\n <br>\n When ali of the nodes of the universal network are considered as an array of points, the sites of the primitive cubic lattice are defined. When only the 26-connected nodes are considered as an array of points, the sites of the bcc lattice are defined. Remember that the nodal positions of the tetragonal disphenoid net also define a bcc lattice. When only the 6-connected nodes are considered, a structure is formed in which the nodal position coincides with the vertices of the 4-connected net of [ 5.18a] defining % of the sites of the primitive cubic lattice. The minimum repeatable unit of the universal network is shown in [6.29]. By a cyclic rotation in 90° increments on each of the [ 100] branches of this repeat unit, the universal net is formed. Repetition clearly reveals the unit to be the source of the ratio of three 6-connected nodes to one 26-connected node, since there are six 6-connected and two 26-connected nodes. 6/2 = 3/1. The concepts of the Universal Node and universal network provi de the basis for an integrative morphological system. This system allows us to organize known three-dimensional structures in concrete physical terms, by way of models. As we shall see, it is also a powerful means for the discovery and classification of new systems of modular order in threedimensional physicogeometric space.<br>\n <br>\n *To review, uriform refers to infinite periodic networks in which ali nodes are of one kind (congruent). Semiuniform refers to infinite periodic networks which have infinite sets of congruent nodes of more than one type.<br>\n <br>\n 6.29 The minimum repeatable unit of the universal network.<br>\n <br>\n 6.27 Twelve-connected subset of Universal Node connector with all12 [110] branches. 6.28 Fourteen-connected subset of Universal Node connector with ali 6 [100] branches and ali eight [111] branches.<br>\n <br>\n 69<br>\n <br>\n Abstraction and Bui lt Form<br>\n <br>\n 7<br>\n <br>\n Classifying Finite Polyhedra with the lntegrative Morphological System<br>\n <br>\n Principies of Order and the Universal No de System<br>\n <br>\n 7.1<br>\n <br>\n 7.7<br>\n <br>\n Both the finite polyhedra and the space filling networks can be generated and classified by means of ou r integrative morphological system. As has already been said, the regular and semiregular polyhedra which were generated by the cubic closest packing of spheres (Table 6.1) are finite subsets of the universal net. Table 7.1 lists these ten polyhedra and provides recipes for their assembly from the kit of parts which is the Universal Node system. Such \"recipes\" are perfectly consistent with ou r interest in dealing with modular structures in terms of physical relationships among components. We can give a structural recipe for each of these polyhedra by giving the morphological features characteristic of each node. The characteristic Universal Node subset can be given in terrns of the direction indices of the occupied nodal spokes. This is identified in Table 7.1 as the \"Branch Directions at Node.\" In this column is indicated how many spokes are occupied in .a given direction and the total number of occupied spokes (\"Overall Coordination\"). '<br>\n <br>\n 7.3<br>\n <br>\n Because the physical design of the Universal Node and its associated branches embodies the principjes of symmetry which govern the combinatorial possibilities within a large class of periodic structures, a deep-rooted empirical understanding of complex relationships evolves with its use. Because the crosssectional shapes of the branches correspond to the shapes of their respective spokes on the Universal Node connector, and because these both reflect axes of symmetry, it is impossible to assemble any periodic array in which the Node is incorrectly oriented. By simply taking note of typical vertices, it is possible to \"blindly\" assemble from nodes and branches the whole of a finite, ora representative sample of an infinite, space filling system. This capability reflects the holistic character of the Universal Node and the universal network. The Universal Node and the universal network are completely interdependent. One cannot exist without the other and they define each other. Although the principies of symmetry embodied in the Universal Node connector can be expressed in terms of a cube or octahedron, the coordinated branch ratios and their multiples are defined by the periodic association of nodes. An individual cube, for example, is only a subset of the universal net and is a periodic (modular) association of nodes.<br>\n <br>\n 70<br>\n <br>\n @ '<br>\n <br>\n 7.4<br>\n <br>\n 7.6<br>\n <br>\n 7.10<br>\n <br>\n 7.12<br>\n <br>\n 7. 1-7.12 Regular and semi regular polyhedra assembled with the Universal Node System.

In the next column the numbers and kinds of branches are given and the relative distances between nodes along each branch, i.e., the edge lengths between node centers are given. The total number of branches for a given polyhedron is equal to the total number of nodes multiplied by the overall coordination divided by two. Next, the inventory and description of the polygonal faces of each polyhedron are given. This includes the total number of faces, the number of each type of face, the kind of face, its symmetry, and the included angles of the face. Also, the face plane directions (Miller indices) are given. They are important in the construction of the dual space filling nets, as they predict the directions of the component branches of the constituent polyhedra. lt can be seen from Table 7.1 that ali but two of the cubic polyhedra have faces in the [111] direction, yet there are no cubic polyhedra in this table with [111] branches.<br>\n <br>\n In the last column is shown relative volumes of the polyhedra when the volume of the tetrahedron is taken as unity. Note that ali of the polyhedra have volumes which are whole-integer multi pies of the tetrahedron. This occurs because the universal network provides a modular dimensional correlation among these diverse polyhedra. Two polyhedra in the hexagonal systemthe triangular prism and hexagonal prism-are also identified in Table 7.1. Photographs of assembled models of these polyhedra are shown in [7. 1][7. 12]. We have now classified the finite polyhedra by means of our integrative morphological system. We now turn to a consideration of infinite periodic systems by returning to the various space filling systems we have identified in Table 5.1.<br>\n <br>\n Classifying Space Filling Systems with the lntegrative Morphological System<br>\n <br>\n Recai I that in our morphological system each vertex of any given space filling system is a subset of the Universal Node. The network of every space filling system will have its dual space filling system or network. There will be a different kind of polyhedron in the dual system for each different kind of vertex in the original system. A space filling system with vertices ali of one kind gives rise to a dual space filling arrangement composed of only one kind of polyhedron. A system composed of two kinds of vertices will give ri se to a dual space filling composed of two kinds of polyhedra, etc. Ali of the space filling systems composed of regular and semiregular polyhedra (Table 5.1) have vertices of one kind, so they will each have dual networks composed of a single type-but in general, a different type for each-of space filling polyhedron. Only those dual space filling systems that are dual to unary systems will themselves have vertices of a single type. For example, the cubic array is a self dual, and the truncated octahedral array has as its dual the array of tetragonal disphenoids. These are the only dual space filling systems that have ali vertices of a single type among the plane faced polyhedra. The binary, etc., space filling systems of Table 5.1 have vertices of one type; but, because they are composed of more than one kind of polyhedron, they give rise to dual nets composed of as many kinds of vertices as there are different polyhedra within the systems. For example, the tetrahedral/octahedral array has one kind of vertex but is binary. lt therefore has a single polyhedron as its space filling dual; but the latter-the rhombic dodecahedron-haq two kinds of vertices. The space filling of rhombicuboctahedron/ octagonal prism/truncated cube/cube has one kind of polyhedron in its dual net but four different kinds of vertices, one for each polyhedron of the parent system.<br>\n <br>\n 71<br>\n <br>\n Classifying Space Filling Systems<br>\n <br>\n Nodal Polyhedra<br>\n <br>\n Space filling systems that are dual to one another form the polyhedral domains of each other's vertices. A given polyhedron in a unary or multi pie space filling system will always define a vertex of its dual space filling network. The polyhedral domain will have the same number of faces as there are edges emanating from the vertex it surrounds. The edges will usually be perpendicular to the faces and will pass through face centers. As it encloses a vertex such a polyhedral domain will define a subset of the Universal Node, and may, therefore, be called a nodal po!yhedron. These nodal polyhedra are figures which characterize the coordination of the Universal Node or any of its subsets. Here again, coordination refers to the number of branches or struts that meet at a node. For example, the nodal polyhedron of the simple cubic net is a cube-one square face for each of its six [1 00] branches. The nodal polyhedron for the truncated octahedron net is the tetragonal disphenoid with one isosceles triangular face for each of the four [11 O] branches. Or, to look at the same structure the other way round, the truncated octahedron is the nodal polyhedron for the 14-connected tetragonal disphenoid net. In this case, the Universal Node has six [1 00] branches and eight [111] branches; these correspond to the six square and eight hexagonal faces of the truncated octahedron, respectively. The nodal polyhedron o f the 12-connected tetrahedral/octahedral (fcc) net is the rhombic dodecahedron. The rhombic dodecahedral net, however, requires two nodal polyhedra, one for each of its two kinds of nodal subsets.

Subsets of the Universal Network<br>\n <br>\n Before we proceed to Table 7.2 and the listing of the cubic space filling systems, it will be useful to look at the Universal Node in more detail.<br>\n <br>\n We now can take a closer look at the space filling systems. Table 7.2 lists the fourteen cubic space filling systems and the nodal polyhedra that define their vertices. Thistable, likeTable 7.1, provides the recipes for the physical assembly of various modular structures. The face plane directions for each nodal polyhedron are identical to the branch directions of the node of the corresponding space filling system.<br>\n <br>\n The Universal Node provides six combinations of two branches which define altogether fourteen possible branch angles of less than 180°. Not ali the combinations are needed in the cubic space filling systems but they will ali eventually come into play as we explore the many modul.ar options provided by the Universal Node. In [7.13] are shown tive sections through the Universal Node connector taken normal to the various symmetry axes. Note that the section in the center is normal to a [112] axis. This axis does not appear in the Universal Node; it is not an axis of rotational symmetry, even though such symmetry is suggested by the sectional view. At the bottom of [7.13] is a list showing the fourteen possible branch ; angles of the six possible combinations oi spokes. lt is only coincidental that there are fourteen angles and fourteen space filling structures, or for that matter, the fourteen faces of the truncated octahedron. As we shall see, this particular set of fourteen angles gives to the Universal Node its extraordinary modularconfiguration capability.<br>\n <br>\n The faces of each nodal polyhedron are characterized by giving the number of each kind of face, the polygonal type, the symmetry, and the face angles. Both the directions and lengths are given for the branches that circumscribe each face, and, finally, the total number of branches for the entire polyhedron.<br>\n <br>\n Photographs of models of the space filling systems described in Table 7.2 and their nodal polyhedra are given in [7.14 ]-[7.27]. From the figures it can be seen that many of the dual space filling systems described by the nodal polyhedra have identical nets. The same net is associated, with different nodal polyhedra by virtue of the various ways in which polygonal circuits may be spanned. An example of this is given by nodal polyhedra of Nos. 5 and 6 of Table 7.2. The former is a square pyramid and the latter is the tetragonal octahedron which is exactly two of the square pyramids put together. They are both associated with the same net, but must be considered distinct space fillers.<br>\n <br>\n Note that although only [1 00], [11 0], and [111] branches appear, each branch needs to be provided in full and half lengths. Also, while [111] branches do not occur among the regular and semiregular polyhedra, they do appear quite frequently as edges of the nodal polyhedra. As a matter of fact, only the cube and octagonal prism do not have faces in the [111] directions.<br>\n <br>\n 7.13 The fourteen possible branch angles of less than 180° of the Universal Node

79<br>\n <br>\n Classifying Space Filling Systems<br>\n <br>\n 8<br>\n <br>\n Hexagonal Space Filling Systems as Subsets of the Universal Network<br>\n <br>\n Because these five dual nets of the hexagonal system's prism space fillers involve planar combinations of 30°, 60°, 120°, and 90° in single polygons, they cannot be fit into the Universal Node system [ 4.8]. This reflects the most interesting fact that it is not possible to define a two-dimensional universal network. The reason for this is that there is no unique necessary planar relationship between the equilateral triangle and the square. We have seen that in three-dimensional space this relationship is trivial, as the Universal Node ably demonstrates. There is a fundamental integrative simplicity to periodic structures in three-dimensional space which is not equaled in two dimensions. Can the assumption that is frequently made about the relative simplicity of two-dimensional space be faulty? To the extent that a universal network in two dimensions is not really possible, the correlative aspects of two-dimensional space are far less elegant than the relationships demonstrated in three-dimensional space by the universal network.<br>\n <br>\n A most remarkable and unexpected discovery is that four of the hexagonal space filling configurations are subsets of the universal cubic net! These are the triangular prism, hexagonal prism, and the two different multi pie systems of triangular and hexagonal prisms (Table 5.1, Nos. 3, 4, 11, 12). Thetriangularand hexagonal prisms are dual to each other. The dual nets of the two forms of the triangular prism/hexagonal prism binary space filling systems can also be accounted for by the Universal Node system. This means that altogether only five of the twenty-three space filling systems we have inventoried in Table 5.1 cannot be accounted for as simple subsets of the universal net. However, the topological equivalents* of these five remaining space filling systems may be formed as subsets of the universal net. These are the packings of triangular prisms and cubes (2 cases); triangular and dodecagonal prisms; triangular prisms, cubes, and hexagonal prisms; and hexagonal prisr)ls, cubes, and dodecagonal prisms (Table 5.1, Nos. 13-15, 21, 22).<br>\n <br>\n 7.28 Topological equivalents of 5 space filling prism combinations of the hexagonal system as subsets of the universal network, shown in plan.<br>\n <br>\n Figure [7.28] shows in plan how this is possible. The cubes become rhombic prisms and the dodecagons become large hexagons with six additional nades at the midpoints of their edges. Ali of these but one (hex prism/rhombic prism/dodecagon prism) form uniform nets. However, it is not possible to form any of the dual nets of these five systems with the Universal Node kit of parts. *Networks (or polyhedra) may be considered topologically equivalent so long as their nades have the same characteristic coordination and the spatial distribution and inventory of their branches (and polygons) are the same, regardless of whether linear dimensions and angular relationships are the same. For example a simpie cube is topologically equivalent to any parallelipiped, and likewise a simple cubic network is topologically equivalent to any network describing a space filling array of parallelepipeds.<br>\n <br>\n 80<br>\n <br>\n Principies of Order<br>\n <br>\n Table 7.3 shows the nine hexagonal space til Iing prism systems; it is in a form identical to that of Table 7.2, except that nodal polyhedra are not given. Figures [7.29]-[7.37] show models of these systems. 7.29-7.37 Hexagonal space filling systems built according to the recipes ofTable 7.3.<br>\n <br>\n Another discovery is that although the hexagonal packing of tetrahedra and octahedra cannot be formed with the Universal Node connector, its dual net of trapezorhombic dodecahedra can by introducing a non-twisted [111] branch as an additional component. Because of this it cannot be formed as a subset of the universal net, but by use of nontwisted [111] branches in combinations with twisted [111] branches it is possible to assemble this configuration [7.38]. We have seen that it is possible to assemble with the Universal Node kit of parts topologically equivalent versions of certain prism systems in the hexagonal family.<br>\n <br>\n 7.38 The network of space filling trapezorhombic dodecahedra<br>\n <br>\n 7.32<br>\n <br>\n 7.37<br>\n <br>\n 81<br>\n <br>\n Classifying Space Filling Systems<br>\n <br>\n Table 7.3 Hexagonal Space Filling Systems<br>\n <br>\n Space Filling Systems<br>\n <br>\n ~~~~~~ Ratio<br>\n <br>\n Branch Directions _B_:ra::_n..:.c__ h_A::_ng:::..l_es.:..___at_N_:o:..:d..:.e_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ Z [1 00] [11 O] [111] [1 00]-[1 00] [11 0]-[11 O] [111]-[111] [1 00]-[11 O] [11 0]-[111] [1 00]-[111]<br>\n <br>\n 8<br>\n <br>\n 6<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 5<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 6<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 60°, 120°<br>\n <br>\n 90o<br>\n <br>\n 8<br>\n <br>\n 7<br>\n <br>\n 5<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 60°, 120°<br>\n <br>\n 90o<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 7<br>\n <br>\n 5<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 60°, 120°<br>\n <br>\n 90o<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 7<br>\n <br>\n 5<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 60°, 120°<br>\n <br>\n 90o<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 5<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 60°, 120°, 180°<br>\n <br>\n 90o<br>\n <br>\n 6<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 60°, 120°<br>\n <br>\n 90o<br>\n <br>\n 5<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 60°, 120°, 180°, 120°<br>\n <br>\n 90o, 90o<br>\n <br>\n 1 Triangular prism [7.29]<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n Hexagonal prism [7.30]<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n Triangular prism Hexagonal prism [7.31]<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n Triangular prism Hexagonal prism [7.32]<br>\n <br>\n 5<br>\n <br>\n Triangular prism Rhombic prism (cube) [7.33]<br>\n <br>\n 6<br>\n <br>\n Triangular prism Rhombic prism (cube) [7.34]<br>\n <br>\n 7<br>\n <br>\n Triangular prism 12-prism [7.35]<br>\n <br>\n 8<br>\n <br>\n 9<br>\n <br>\n Hexagonal prism Triangular prism<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n Rhombic prism [7.36]<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n Hexagonal prism<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 12-prism<br>\n <br>\n 1<br>\n <br>\n Rhombic prism [7.37]<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n 82<br>\n <br>\n Principies of Order<br>\n <br>\n Table 7.4 Dodecahedral Space Filling Systems<br>\n <br>\n Space Filling System<br>\n <br>\n Space Filling Ratio<br>\n <br>\n z [100]<br>\n <br>\n [110] [111] [100]-[100] [110]-[110] [111]-[111] [100]-[110] [110]-[111] [100]-[111]<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n [7.40]<br>\n <br>\n 5 1<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n Trapezorhombic dodecahedron<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n 8<br>\n <br>\n 8<br>\n <br>\n 1 Elongated dodecahedron<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n Branch Directions Branch Angles at Node<br>\n <br>\n [7.38]<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n Octahedrally truncated rhombic dodecahedron Tetrahedron<br>\n <br>\n 8<br>\n <br>\n 8<br>\n <br>\n 144°44'<br>\n <br>\n 60°<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n 70°32'<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n [7.41]<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n Cubically truncated rhombic dodecahedron<br>\n <br>\n 90o<br>\n <br>\n 4 3<br>\n <br>\n 125°1 fi 109°28'<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n Cube<br>\n <br>\n [7.42]<br>\n <br>\n 5 Cubocta-<br>\n <br>\n 90o<br>\n <br>\n 4 3<br>\n <br>\n hedrally truncated rhombic dodecahedron<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n 6<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n 125°1 fi 144°44'<br>\n <br>\n 60°<br>\n <br>\n Cube Tetrahedron<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 6 Truncated rhombicuboctahedron<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 60°<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 90o<br>\n <br>\n 6<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n 60°, 120°<br>\n <br>\n 4 1<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n 60°<br>\n <br>\n 109°28'<br>\n <br>\n 90o<br>\n <br>\n 70°32'<br>\n <br>\n 90o<br>\n <br>\n Cuboctahedron 1 Octahedron<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n Triangular prism<br>\n <br>\n 8<br>\n <br>\n 7 Truncated rhombicuboctahedron Truncated cube Truncated tetrahedron<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n Triangular prism<br>\n <br>\n 8<br>\n <br>\n 83<br>\n <br>\n Classifying Space Filling Systems<br>\n <br>\n 90°, 144°44' 135°<br>\n <br>\n 90o<br>\n <br>\n 125°16'<br>\n <br>\n lt is also possible to assemble a topological equivalent in the hexagonal system of the tetrahedral/octahedral net. This is shown in [7.39]. lt is achieved by the use of [11 O] and [ 100] branches. At each node, nine [11 O] branches and three [1 00] branches meet to forma uniform structure. In this configuration every other layer is collapsed by 50%, with regular octahedra stacked vertically on collapsed octahedra having the symmetry of the hexagonal prism.<br>\n <br>\n Dodecahedral Space Filling Systems<br>\n <br>\n There are four more space filling systems that are, along with their duais, subsets of the universal net. These are the elongated dodecahedron and the three truncated versions of the rhombic dodecahedron which combine with cubes and/or tetrahedra to fill ali space (see Chapter 5 [5.15]). The recipes for these systems along with the trapezorhombic dodecahedral system are given in the usual form in Table 7.4. Nodal polyhedra are not given in the table; they may be easily constructed. The elongated dodecahedral and two of the three truncated rhombic dodecahedral systems are shown in [7.40]-[7.42]. The two truncated rhombicuboctahedral systems described in Chapter 5 (p. 49) are also included in Table 7.4 (Nos. 6, 7), but are not illustrated here.<br>\n <br>\n 7.39 Topological equivalenl in lhe hexagonal syslem of lhe lelrahedral/oclahedral network.<br>\n <br>\n 7.40 Network of space filling elongaled dodecahedron (see Table 7.4). 7.41 Network of space filling lruncaled rhombic dodecahedra/lelrahedra (see Table 7.4).<br>\n <br>\n 84<br>\n <br>\n Principies of Order<br>\n <br>\n We have discovered that Universal Node imposes an inherent arder. Every new structure assembled with this integrative morphological system is instantly understood and may be classified in terms of its relation to the whole. The Universal Node itself allows us to anticipate and then to build a diverse array of alternative modular configurations, in which the notion of subsets of the whole emerges as an ordering principie.<br>\n <br>\n 7.42 Network of space filling lruncaled dodecahedra/cubes (see Table 7.4).<br>\n <br>\n Triangulated Structures Derived from the Universal Network<br>\n <br>\n In our inventory of periodic structures based on the universal network, we have seen very few triangulated systems, particularly those in which a minimum deviation in branch lengths is exhibited.* We are familiar with the tetrahedron/octahedron system [7.16a] (which is composed of equilateral triangles) and the space filling of tetragonal disphenoids that forms the 14-connected bcc network [7.15b]. The bcc network is composed of two branch lengths ([100] and [111 ]) which vary in length by only 15%. The space filling tetragonal octahedron [7.19b] is composed of the same two branches and forms a triangular network with 8c and 14-connected nades. There are some other triangulated systems among the dual nets (nodal polyhedra) of Table 7.2, but their edge-length ratios deviate considerably (by approximately 39%) from the equilateral ideal. In spite of this, .any of these networks might serve as useful structures in certain appl ications. *Triangulated structures tend to be more energyefficient when differences in branch lengths are minimized. See the Law of Closest Packing and Triangulation in Chapter 1.<br>\n <br>\n 85<br>\n <br>\n There are two other efficient periodic triangulated systems which can be considered subsets of the universal net and which relate to lhe tetragonal disphenoid and tetragonal octahedron. They are based upon two dual nets from the space filling of regular and semiregular polyhedra (Table 7.2)-namely, the space filling of rhombic dodecahedra [7.16b] and rhombic hexahedra [7.17b]. Both of these systems are composed of the same rhombic face, which is formed by four [111] branches. This rhombic face may be easily subdivided into two isosceles triangles by placing a [100] branch across its short diagonal. The triangles, like those of the tetragonal disphenoid and tetragonal octahedron, are formed with branches that differ in length by only 15%, and therefore constitute an efficient basis for triangulated systems. Both the triangulated rhombic dodecahedron and hexahedron networks have 10-connected and 8-connected nades ([7.43a], dodecahedra; and [7.43b], hexahedra). lt is important to point out that neither of these systems suffers from any local instabilities because no new vertices are formed and, therefore, no unsupported planar sets of triangles are to be found. We have Iisted ali but one of those periodic systems composed of equilateral triangles or approximately equilateral triangles that are subsets of the universal network. This is not to say that there are no other systems which relate to the universal net. We will find again and again that the universal node-net concept is constantly reappearing in different forms. We will find that the same principies of symmetry upon which the Universal Nade is based govern an array of periodic structures which, although they are not : subsets of the universal net, do relate to. it in sophisticated and subtle ways. ·<br>\n <br>\n Triangulated Structures<br>\n <br>\n b 7.43 Network of space filling triangulated rhombic dodecahedra (a); network of space filling triangulated rhombic hexahedra (b).<br>\n <br>\n 8<br>\n <br>\n In our inventory of space filling systems we have seen two major subsets of the Universal Node: the 6-connected node of the sim pie cubic network which incorporates ali of the [ 100] directions available on the no de [8.1 a]; and the 12-connected node of the tetrahedral/octahedral fcc network which incorporates ali of the [ 11 O] directions of the node [8.1 b]. We have notas yet observed the result of connecting the eight [111] directions of the node [8.1c]. This results in an 8-connected [8.1 d] network that does not define any plane-faced polyhedron. lts nodes are the site of the bcc lattice, and it is closely related to the network formed by space filling tetragonal disphenoids [8.1 e]. lf the [1 00] branches are removed from this latter tetrahedral network, the 8-connected bcc net results.<br>\n <br>\n Saddle Polyhedra andthe Universal Network. The Cube Revisited<br>\n <br>\n We now have three uniform networks; these constitute the most symmetrical possibilities for the periodic subdivision of space. They are equivalent to the simpie cubic, body centered cubic, and face centered cubic lattices and, therefore, ali have fui I cubic symmetry. We note that symmetry can be preserved even with _ \"incomplete\" nodes, i.e., a node with spokes for only the six [ 100] directions, will still retain fui I cubic symmetry, as will a node with only the eight [111] directions, o r one with only the twelve [ 11 O] directions [8.2]. There are no other periodic networks in which the nodes have this much symmetry.* The universal network is a combination of the three most symmetrical coordinate systems into one comprehensive system. *The 14-connected node of the unary tetrahedron (tetragonal disphenoidal) system has fui I cubic symmetry but because it has two kinds of branches, ([100] and [111] branches), it does not forma completely homogeneous structure. As I have already pointed out, this 14-connected net is a combination ofthe simple cubic and bcc nets.<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n a<br>\n <br>\n e<br>\n <br>\n d<br>\n <br>\n 8.1 The Un iversa I No de con nector with ali six possible [I 00] branches attached (a); with ali twelve possible [110] branches attached (b); with ali eight possible [111] branches attached (c). Note the repeating network with ali eight possible [111] branches at each node. Nodes fali at sites of bcc lattice (d); repeating network with ali eight possible [111] branches, and with addition of ali six possible [100] branches at each node. Nodes of this 14-connected network also fali at sites of bcc lattice (e).<br>\n <br>\n 86<br>\n <br>\n Minimal Surfaces, Mean Curvature The simple cubic and the fcc networks both have their dual nets, but what of the bcc network just described? lts edges do not define any polyhedron---at /east not any plane-faced polyhedron. The generation of dual space fillers is a reciprocation process: the centers of contiguous polyhedral cells are joined through their common faces .forming a dual space filling network. lf we do not have a polyhedral cell then how can we have a dual space filling network? In ou r earlier discussion (Chapter 5, p. 50; [5. 18]-[5. 19]) of threedimensional connected networks which do not form plane-faced polyhedra, it was pointed out that various kinds of skew polygonal circuits are formed. lt is possible to span such a nonplanar skew polygon with a so-called minimal surface, forming a doubly curved saddle shaped module. A minimal surface is a surface of zero mean curvature; such a surface can be associated with any closed polygon. lf the polygon is flat, the minimal surface will be flat. lf the polygon is skew, then the minimal surface will be warped, with its positive curvature exactly equal to its negative curvature; hence the surface wi li be of a saddle shape. Directions<br>\n <br>\n Symmetry<br>\n <br>\n 2·fold<br>\n <br>\n 3·fold<br>\n <br>\n 4·fold<br>\n <br>\n 8.2 Full cubic symmetry is preserved in nades with only [1 00] spokes, or [11 O] spokes, or [111] spokes.<br>\n <br>\n 87<br>\n <br>\n Minimal Surfaces, Mean Curvature<br>\n <br>\n lt was shown by Euler that ali mini mal surfaces must have zero mean curvature at every point of the surface* and that ali such surfaces that are nonplanar must be saddle shaped. A minimal surface can be easily formed by immersing a wire trame in a soap solution. Upon removing it, we find that a very thin film of soap spans the trame, arranging itself so as to have the smallest possible area. The film is stressed in pure tension and is in a state of minimal potential energy. lf such a surface is duplicated in a rigid material, it can form an extremely strong structure of very small thickness with resistance to both compression and tension forces. Although thsy can be easily formed and studied empirically, such minimal surfaces are extremely difficult to treat mathematically.** *Courant and Robbins have defined the minimal surface as follows. \"Consider the perpendicular to the surface at [a point] P, and ali planes containing it. These planes will intersect the surface in curves which, in general, have different curvatures at P. Now consider the curves of minimum and maximum curvature, respectively. (In general, the planes containing these curves will be perpendicular to each other.) One-half the sum ot these two curvatures is the mean curvature of the surface at P.\" **In the 1870s, the Belgian physicist Plateau experimented with minimal-surface soap films. The general problem of mini mal surfaces is usually referred to as Plateau's problem. Mathematically Plateau's problem is exceedingly difficult as it isconnected with the solution of a parti ai differential equation, ora system of such equations.<br>\n <br>\n Saddle Surfaces and lnterstitial Domains Some areas on a saddle surface are flatter than others and, therefore, ali points on the surface do not respond equally well to concentrated loads. When such saddle surfaces are associated in a periodic array, the physical interaction of one surface on another produces a compensatory effect which greatly increases their efficiency as structures. An isolated saddle polygon is nota fully stable structure. lt requires the cooperative effect of associated saddle po/ygons if its advantages as a doub/y curved surface are to be fully realized. This is true whether the surface is a tension system, as in the case of the soap film, ora surface of rigid material capab/e of resisting tension and compression forces. The significance of saddle figures for the theory of modular structure is that threedimensional periodic connected networks that do not describe plane faced polyhedra nonetheless form saddle figures of various kinds. In previous chapters we a/ways started with a polyhedron ora set of polyhedra and then found ways in which these could be generated and combined. For the saddle figures, we are, at least initially, faced with a different problem: the saddle figure must be generated from an existing network. lt is a problem of partitioning off some fundamental vo/umetric region or set of regions with sadd/e (or plane) faces to forma space filling figure ora set of space filling figures. We sha/1 reler to this fundamental spatial region (ora set of regions) as the interstítial domain(s)* of lhe network. The inlerstitial domain is formed by spanning with a minimal surface the group oi po/ygonal circuits that as a nonintersecting set wi/1 combine to forma c/osed po/yhedron or set oi closed po/yhedra. The appropriate group oi polygonal circuits is determined by spanning lhe smal/est, next smallest, ... po/ygons until a closed ce/1 or set of cells is tound. Both unary and multip/e space filling domains can be found by means of this method.<br>\n <br>\n lt is important to emphasize the use oi mínima/ surfaces to generate the faces of interstitial domains. The p/ane-faced polyhedra which compose the space filling systems ofTable 5.1 are interstitial domains of the uniform networks which they define. /f these structures are formed as networks without faces, the faces may be found in the same manner in which the faces of the saddle faced interstitial domains are found, i. e., by spanning with a minimal surface the set of smal/est, next smallest, etc. nonintersecting circuits formed by the constituent polygons which com pose the network which combine to form c/osed polyhedral cel/s.* When the proper interstitial domain (or domains) oi a net are found, fundamental repeating space filling units are formed which greatly increase ou r ability to perceive structure in an array otherwise very difficult to understand. Because of the structural advantages of the saddle surfaces, the saddle polyhedra have significant implications for lhe design of physical structures. *In lhe cases of the dual nets this spanning principie breaks down because of lhe multi pie ways in which identical networks are spanned to form the nodal polyhedra. In such cases, the requirements of duality remove the ambiguities.<br>\n <br>\n The confluence oi the notion oi threedimensional connected networks and that of minimal surfaces has /ed me and others independently to the invention oi a new c/ass of po/yhedra that are cal/edsaddle po/yhedra. A saddle polyhedron is a closed figure formed by a finite number of saddle polygons bounded by straighl edges.* Although, as with plane faced polyhedra, lhere can be an infinite number of saddle polyhedra, only those figures which can be used to build infinite periodic structures are of concern in the present work. Michae/ Burt has studied the limiting case oi a finite set of nonspace-filling sadd/e polyhedra composed oi regular faces which he derives from the Platonic and Archimedean solids.** *A few infinite regular saddle polyhedra have been discovered by Schoen following upon my earlier invention of (finite) saddle polyhedra. Schoen, with whom I have collaborated, has dane major mathematical work on the subject of saddle polyhedra and infinite periodic minimal surfaces, and has discovered many other finite saddle polyhedra which do not fi li space but which satisfy rigorous mathematical criteria for regularity. See bibliography for citations of Schoen's work. **Burt has independently discovered lhe saddle polyhedron concept, although his emphasis is somewhat different than mine. He has studied some of lhe space filling saddle polyhedra and the class of infinite periodic minimal surfaces, which is treated !ater in this book, as well as lhe non-space-filling finite class mentioned above.<br>\n <br>\n 8.3 Space filling bcc saddle tetrahedra.<br>\n <br>\n *This term has been proposed by Schoen, who also refers to lhe domain of lhe vertex (which is simply the polyhedron of lhe dual net) as the symmetry domain. Our nodal polyhedron of Chapter 7 is equivalent to Schoen's symmetry domain. The term nodal polyhedron was originally proposed by Schoen as well.<br>\n <br>\n 88<br>\n <br>\n Saddle Polyhedra and Connected Networks<br>\n <br>\n Saddle Polyhedra<br>\n <br>\n Our first saddle polyhedron is the interstitial domain of the 8-connected bcc network. lt is a saddle tetrahedron bounded by four regular saddle tetragons. We, therefore, see the emergence of a space filling bcc saddle tetrahedron. [8.3]. Secause the bond angles of the bcc network are 70°32', the saddle tetragon faces of the bcc tetrahedron have included angles of 70°32'. Such included angles or face angles are the crucial data necessary to describe particular saddle faces and, therefore, particular saddle polyhedra. As we shall see, the fourteen possible branch angles provided by the Universal No de account for ali of the combi nations of face angles that appear in our sàddle polyhedra. Once we have transformed a conneéted network into an array of space filling saddle polyhedra, it is a sim pie matter to find the dual space filling network. The interstitial domain will be the nodal polyhedron of the dual net. From this, we know that the network which is dual to the bcc net must have 4-connected vertices because the nodal polyhedron of the dual net will be the bcc saddle tetrahedron with four faces. The dual net of the bcc net is the coplanar 90° 4-connected network of [5.18a]. The interstitial domain of this dual net is a saddle octahedron bounded by regular saddie hexagons with included angles of 90° corresponding to bond angles of the net. This space filling bcc saddle octahedron is then the nodal polyhedron of the bcc network [8.4]. '<br>\n <br>\n Polyhedra with Less than Four Faces<br>\n <br>\n We find that the network of this saddle bcc octahedron [8.5], like the bcc network itself, is also a subset of the universal net in which four [1 00] directions meet at each node. In fact, ali of the networks described in Chapter 5 are subsets of the universal network. Some also generate extremely significant saddle polyhedra. The 3-connected Laves network of the decagon circuits [5.17a], has as its interstitial domain a saddle trihedron [8.6] bounded by three saddle decagons with included angles of 120°. The nade of this net is a coplanar subset of the [110] directions in which three [11 O] branches meet at 120° in a common plane. This network is shown in [8.7] (which the reader will recognize as being the same as [5.17a].)<br>\n <br>\n A closed plane-faced polyhedron must have at least four faces. This is no longer true if nonplanar faces are allowed. We see that the saddle trihedron is not only a three-faced polyhedron, but that it is even a unary space filler. This trihedron, like many of the saddle polyhedra we will soon examine, has certain vertices at which only two edges meet. Such 2-connected vertices do not occur amongst any of the plane-faced polyhedra. lt might be said that such vertices make possible the existence of saddle polyhedra. Surprisingly, even the saddle polyhedra with such 2-connected vertices sti li satisfy Euler's theorem for polyhedra (p. 32): faces+ vertices = edges + 2. This is so, because for every 2-connected vertex there must also be an extra edge. This saddle decatrihedron of the Laves network has the symmetry of a triangular prism: one axis of 3-fold symmetry and three axes of 2-fold symmetry. The dual of the decatrihedronal space filling system is the mirrar image of the original network, i.e., the system is an enantiomorphic self-dual. A model of these dual networks juxtaposed is shown in [8.8].<br>\n <br>\n 8.5 Network of space filling bcc saddle octahedra. 8.6 Space filling saddle decatrihedra.<br>\n <br>\n 8.7 Network of space filling saddle decatrihedra.<br>\n <br>\n 8.4 Space filling bcc saddle octahedra.<br>\n <br>\n 8.8 By juxtaposing networks of right- and lefthanded space filling decatrihedra we see them to be duais to each other.<br>\n <br>\n 89<br>\n <br>\n Connected Networks<br>\n <br>\n The Diamond Network<br>\n <br>\n Wurtzite and Carborundum<br>\n <br>\n The 4-connected diamond net was also introduced in Chapter5 [5.18b]. In its simplicity and symmetry, it is one of the most fundamental of ali periodic structures. lt is rivaled only by the three cubic nets in the hierarchy of fundamental three-dimensional structures. The node of the diamond net is a subset of the bcc node; it has four [111] directions disposed at 109°28' angles. lt is assembled by attaching [111] branches to every other [111] directed spoke on the Universal Nade [8.9].<br>\n <br>\n Wurtzite, a form of zinc sulfide, and Carborundum 111, a form of silicon carbide, are two crystals whose atomic positions are the same as in diamond. (Wells 1962a). Therefore, their networks appear to be identical to the diamond network. The use of saddle polyhedra as interstitial domains, however, enables us to clearly distinguish the subtle differences between these seemingly identical structures.<br>\n <br>\n The interstitial domain of the diamond net is a saddle tetrahedron bounded by four regular hexagonal saddle faces with included angles of 109°28' [8.10]. This diamond tetrahedron has the symmetry of the regular tetrahedron. The nodal polyhedron of the diamond net is another diamond tetrahedron. lt is a self-dual. The diamond network and the simple cubic network are the only self-dual uniform networks. lf eriantiomorphism is permitted, the 3-connected Laves network also qualifies as a self-dual. There are apparently no others, although this has not been proven mathematically.* *There is also one semiuniform net with two kinds of nades which is a self-dual. This is discussed later in this chapter. lt is interesting to note that the regular tetrahedron is the only plane-faced finite polyhedron which is a selfdual and the diamond saddle tetrahedron with fui I tetrahedral symmetry gives rise to a selfdual space filling system.<br>\n <br>\n Both wurtzite and Carborundum 111 may be assembled from the Universal Node system but neither are subsets of the universal network. The wurtzite structure is a subset of the trapezorhombic dodecahedron net and its overall symmetry is hexagonal rather than cubic. Like the diamond net, ali of its nades are alike surrounded by four branches meeting at 109°28'. lt is necessary to use both twisted and nontwisted [111] branches to assemble this structure with the Universal Node System [8. 11] The wurtzite is less symmetrical than the diamond structure, and so is composed of two interstitial domains: a trihedron bounded by three saddle hexagons of 2-fold symmetry, and a pentahedron bounded by two regular saddle hexagons and three 2-fold saddle hexagons [8.12]. Ali included angles for these various saddle faces are of necessity 109°28'.<br>\n <br>\n 8. li Four-connected network of wurtzite. 8.12 Wurtzite structure formed by space filling of saddle trihedra and saddle pentahedra.<br>\n <br>\n 8.9 The 4-connected diamond network. 8. I O The diamond saddle tetrahedra.<br>\n <br>\n 90<br>\n <br>\n The Carborundum 111 structure is like both the diamond and wurtzite networks in that ali of its nodes are 4-connected with [111] branches (twisted and nontwisted) disposed coequally at 109°28' [8. 13]. However, the interstitial regions of this network give rise to three polyhedral domains: the wurtzite pentahedron and trihedron and the diamond tetrahedron.The admixture of these three polyhedra in a ternary space fi li i ng system defines the Carborundum 111 net [8. 14].<br>\n <br>\n Saddle Polyhedra<br>\n <br>\n 8.13 Four-connected network of Carborundum 111. 8.14 Carborundum 111 structure formed by space filling of saddle trihedra, saddle pentahedra, and diamond saddle tetrahedra.<br>\n <br>\n Unlike the diamond net, neither the wurtzite nor Carborundum nets are selfduals, although the nodal polyhedra of the wurtzite and Carborundum nets are very similar to the diamond tetrahedron. Wurtzite has a tetrahedron bounded by one plane regular hexagon and three saddle hexagons with 2-fold symmetry, while Carborundum requires two nodal polyhedra. Both are, of course, tetrahedra: one is bounded by one regular plane hexagon and three saddle hexagons with only mirror symmetry; and the other is bounded by the same three saddle hexagons, but with a single regular saddle hexagon with included face angles of 109°28'. Although the net of the wurtzite nodal tetrahedra can be assembled with the Universal Node system, the pair of Carborundum nodal tetrahedra cannot. The Carborundum network is, in fact, a mixture of cubic and hexagonal structures. Because of this, the Carborundum nodal polyhedra require a special set of branch angle relationships which cannot b,e accommodated by the Universal Node connector. lt is possible, however, to assemble the wurtzite nodal polyhedron in a configuration which is topologically equivalent to the network formed by the packing of Carborundum nodal tetrahedra.<br>\n <br>\n Describing the Universal Network with Saddle Polyhedra I have notas yet described the interstitial domains or nodal polyhedra for the universal net. We already know that there will be two kinds ofnodal polyhedra dueto the two kinds of nodal subsets. I have noted in Chapter 6 that the universal network has three 6-connected nodes for every 26-connected node. We know from this that we are looking for a multiple space filling system which consists of a 26-faced nodal polyhedron with fui I cubic symmetry and a 6-faced nodal polyhedron with tetragonal symmetry which together fi li space in the ratío of one to three. There is no example of such an array in our space filling inventory (Table 5.1) so we can be fairly sure that we will need saddle polyhedra. We find that the interstitial domains of the universal net consist of two kinds of polyhedra: an orthorhombic* saddle tetrahedron bounded by four 2-fold saddle quadri laterais (face ang les of 90°, 45°, 90°, 45°); and an enantiomorphic pai r of trihedra, each bounded by the same two right triangular faces (included angles of 90°, 54°44', 35°16',) and one 2-fold saddle quadrilateral [8.15]. This trihedron has one axis of 2-fold symmetry. This set fills space in the ratio of one tetrahedron for every four trihedra. We shall cal I its members the universal tetrahedron and universal trihedron. These interstitial domains tell us that the dual network which defines the nodal polyhedra will have two kinds of vertices. Careful examination of these interstitial polyhedra shows that there will be 3-connected nodes with branches meeting at 120° on a common plane and 4-connected nodes with branches meeting at 90° on a common plane. The nodal polyhedra that are generated are of considerable interest. *Figures of the orthorhombic class have three 2-fold axes of symmetry.<br>\n <br>\n 8.15 lnterstitial domains of the universal network: universal tetrahedron and an enantiomorphic pai r of universal trihedra.<br>\n <br>\n 91<br>\n <br>\n Describing the Universal Network<br>\n <br>\n The 26-faced nodal polyhedron of the Universal Node is bounded by eight plane regular hexagonal faces in the [111] directions, twelve 2-fold saddle hexagons in the [110] directions (face ang les of 90° and 120°), and six 4-fold saddle dodecagons in the [1 00] directions (face ang les 90° and 120°). The sixfaced nodal polyhedron is bounded by two of the 4-fold saddle dodecagons in the [1 00] directions, and four of the 2-fold saddle hexagons in the [110] directions. These we will cal I the universal cuboctadodecahedron and the universal hexahedron; they are shown in [8.16]. These two polyhedra fi li space in the ratio of 1:3, justas the nodal ratio of the universal network leads us to expect. A space filling array is shown in [8.17]. The universal cuboctadodecahedron has fui I cubic symmetry and the universal hexahedron has tetragonal symmetry, so the symmetry requirements of the nodes are satisfied.<br>\n <br>\n 8.16 Nodal polyhedra of the universal network: universal cuboctadodecahedron and universal hexahedron. 8.17 Space filling of universal cuboctadodecahedra and universal hexahedra.<br>\n <br>\n Visualizing the Universal Network<br>\n <br>\n The universal network may be visualized with the aid of an assembly of three enantiomorphic pairs of universal trihedra. These six trihedra share a common [111] branch when grouped and their collective vertices fali exactly at the eight corners of the cube [8.18]. The corresponding relative branch lengths are: for the [1 00] direction, 1; for [11 O], v2; and for [111 ], \\13. Note that in this cubical assembly two opposite vertices are 7-connected and that the additional six vertices are only 2-connected. lf such a cubical assembly is packed with others of the same species, such that the 7-connected corners are always matched and that 2-connected corners are always matched, each collection of 7-connected vertices becomes a 26-connected vertex; i.e., a Universal Node vertex, and each collection of 2-connected vertices becomes a 6-connected vertex. A space filling collection of these cubically assembled trihedra gives rise to a second interstitial space which takes the form of the universal tetrahedron. The ratio of three 6-connected nodes for every 26-connected node is clearly explained by the cu bicai assembly of trihedra. Note that there are two 7-connected nodes for every six 2-connected nodes: i.e., a ratio of one to three. A space filling array of universal trihedra and universal tetrahedra can be seen in [8.19].<br>\n <br>\n 92<br>\n <br>\n 8.18 Cu bicai assembly of three enantiomorphic pairs of universal trihedra can repeat to describe the universal network. 8.19 Space filling of universal trihedra and universal tetrahedra. ·<br>\n <br>\n The unit cell of the universal network is an array of eight cubical sets of six universal trihedra. This complex will repeat by simpie translation along the [1 00] directions to define the entire universal network. lts network is shown in [8.20a] along with the network of the cu bicai set of six universal trihedra [8.20b]. The cubical set of six trihedra will repeat to define theentire ~ structure but not by simple translation since a reflection through [100]-directed mirror planes ora rotation about ali [100] branches is required. We see in the unit cell of the universal net that the 26connected Universal Nodes fali on the sites of the body centered cubic lattice, and the 6-connected Universal Node subsets fali on three-fourths of the sites of the simple cubic lattice. 8.20 The un it cell of the universal network (a), and the network of the cu bicai set of six universal trihedra showing the sites of the 26-connected and 6-connected Universal Nades (b).<br>\n <br>\n Saddle Polyhedra<br>\n <br>\n Regular and Semiregular Saddle Polyhedra I now return to a discussion of the general characteristics of the saddle polyhedra. We have already seen that there can be an infinite number of saddle polyhedra, and I have already restricted our inquiry to those polyhedra that can be used to assemble infinite periodic structures. Because saddle polyhedra usually have sets of vertices in which two edges meet, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find saddle polyhedra which have ali their vertices alike. Because of this, there are no simple cases of regular or semi regular saddle polyhedra. Schoen has identified a set of nine finite regular saddle polyhedra in which ali vertices are uniform, but these are comparable to the KeplerPoinsot stellated polyhedra in which faces are permitted to intersect.* Thr13e of these regular saddle polyhedra are related to the regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and cube, respectively. The six others are related to the icosahedron and cannot form periodic structures. The former three are shown in [8.21]. They are the tetrahedral hemihexahedron with three saddle tetragons (60° angles) at each vertex and 3 intersecting faces; the octahedral hemioctahedron with four saddle hexagons (60° and 90° angles) at each vertex and 4 intersecting faces; and the cubic hemioctahedron with three saddle hexagons (60°, 90°, 90°, 90° ang les) at each vertex and four intersecting faces** As far as I know, the only regular and semiregular saddle polyhedra which do not have intersecting faces are infinite systems. Some of these will be described in Chapter 9. These are derived from space fillings of finite saddle polyhedra with certain of their faces omitted; they have also been identified by Schoen (1970).<br>\n <br>\n Of ali of the saddle polyhedra that we will examine (which total altogether over fifty examples), there are four which have special significance, three of which have already been described (the bcc tetrahedron, the bcc octahedron, and the diamond tetrahedron). They are characterized by the fact that they are bounded exclusively by one kind of regular skew polygon. lf it were not for the fact that they each have a secondary set of 2-connected vertices, and, therefore, have two kinds of vertices, these polyhedra would qualify as regular polyhedra. When they are packed to fill space, the 2-connected vertices disappear and only one kind of vertex remains. These figures and the nets to which they belong are uniform and constitute a unique class of polyhedra, perhaps as uni que as the Platonic figures.<br>\n <br>\n 8.22 Space filling of tetrahedral decahedra. 8.23 Network of space filling tetrahedral decahedra is 6-connected subset of 12connected fcc network.<br>\n <br>\n *Schoen (1968a). These are the metric realizations of a class of regular maps enumerated by Coxeter and Moser (1964, p. 112). **The names of these polyhedra are dueto Norman Johnson.<br>\n <br>\n 8.21 Regular saddle polyhedra: octahedral hemioctahedron, tetrahedral hemihexahedron, and cubic hemioctahedron.<br>\n <br>\n 93<br>\n <br>\n A fourth saddle polyhedron ranks with the foregoing three in importance. lt is a tensided polyhedron bounded by six regular skew saddle quadrilaterals (60° angles) and four regular skew hexagons (60° angles) [8.22]. lt has tetrahedral symmetry and we shall cal I it the tetrahedral decahedron. lt is a unary space filling polyhedron and is derived from a 6-connected (rather than fully 12-connected) version of the fcc network [8.23]. Because it has more than one kind of regular face it is analogous to the semiregular polyhedra, except, again, for the fact of the 2-connected vertices. The 6-connected fcc network is yet another branch system that may be used to connect the points of a given lattice. These four polyhedra-the bcc tetrahedron, the bcc octahedron, the diamond tetrahedron, and the tetrahedral decahedron-are the only known saddle polyhedra, which fill space alone or in combination with other polyhedra, that are bounded exclusively by regular saddle polygons.<br>\n <br>\n Regular and Semiregular<br>\n <br>\n Characteristics of Skew Polygons<br>\n <br>\n The many additional saddle polyhedra that have been discovered are bounded by a variety of skew polygonal faces of varying degrees of symmetry. In review, the regular polygon is defined as any circuit, plane or skew, of straight line segments that is equilateral and equiangular and in which ali vertices are equidistant from a common central point. In projection, ali regular skew polygons can be made to yield regular plane polygons. As we are about to see, the requirement of equal edges and equal angles is not enough to uniquely define a regular skew polygon. Note that while the rotational symmetry of a regular plane polygon corresponds exactly to the number of sides, the rotational symmetry of a regular skew polygon is exactly half the number of sides. For example, a plane square has 4-fold symmetry, while a regular skew tetragon has only 2-fold symmetry. A regular plane hexagon has 6-fold symmetry, while a regular skew hexagon wili have only 3-fold symmetry.<br>\n <br>\n A curious class of polygons emerges which, although it consists of equal edges and equal included angles, is stili not regular because of the particular manner in which the included angles are directed. An example of this is the skew decagon of the decatrihedron we have already discussed. This saddle polygon is equilateral and equiangular but has only 2-fold symmetry. Ali of its ang les are 120°, but these are oriented in such a manner that an irregular 2-fold ten-sided polygon is formed [8.24]. Two other examples of this class of face are found in the faces of a truncated tetrahedral decahedron which is bounded by four regular plane hexagons, six saddle octagons and four saddle dodecagons [8.25]. Both of the saddle faces are equiangular (120° included angles) and equilateral. However, they are not regular-the octagon has only 2-fold symmetry and the dodecagon has only 3-fold symmetry. As suggested by an examination of the polyhedron to which these faces belong, the octagon is simply a truncated regular saddle quadri lateral of 60° angles and the dodecagon is a truncated regular saddle hexagon of 60° ang les. The truncated polygons have the same symmetry as their parent figures.<br>\n <br>\n Another frequently occurring class of skew polygons consists of equal sides but face angles of two different kinds. Such polygons frequently appear to be regular when viewed in projection and tend to be relatively symmetrical. They have two classes of vertices, one set of which falis at the intersection of two edges which when viewed in projection have included angles of 180°. This has the effect of transforming an n-gon into a (n I 2)-gon when it is viewed in plan. An example of this class of skew polygon is an eight-sided saddle polygon with equal edges but included angles of 60° and 90°. Another example is an octagon with included angles of 70°32' and 109°28' [8.26]. These octagons have 4-fold symmetry. In the inventory of saddle polyhedra there are also various saddle polygons which consist of two kinds of edges and two kinds of included angles. There are also saddle polygons which have two edge types and one kind of included angle. 8.26 Skew octagon (4-fold symmetry).<br>\n <br>\n I<br>\n <br>\n ~ 8.24 Skew decagon of decatrihedron (2-fold symmetry). 8.25 Skew octagon (2-fold symmetry, a), and skew dodecagon (3-fold symmetry, b) are the faces of a truncated tetrahedral decahedron.<br>\n <br>\n a<br>\n <br>\n b<br>\n <br>\n 94<br>\n <br>\n w o o I I<br>\n <br>\n Saddle Polyhedra<br>\n <br>\n +<br>\n <br>\n Saddle Polyhedra: An lnventory of Possibilities<br>\n <br>\n Because of ou r success with the universal netas a means of accounting for ali of the space filling systems composed of planefaced polyhedra, and because it is also possible to consider the nets of ali of the saddle polyhedra so far described to be subsets of the universal net, we wi li consideron/y.those additional saddle polyhedra and related nets which can be defined by this system. Many different modes of exploration were used to discover numerous saddle polyhedra. In some cases, they have been derived directly from networks. This is how the concept first saw realization-the bcc tetrahedron and diamond tetrahedron being the first discovered in that order. Many others were derived by a process of truncçltion of vertices or augmentation of vertices. New uniform and semiuniform* networks have been derived by an exploration of the various combinatorial possibilities of previously established saddle polyhedra or saddle polygons. The Universal Node concept is a powerful tool for the systematic empirical exploration and analysis of the concept of periodic nets as they relate to saddle polyhedra.<br>\n <br>\n Many saddle polyhedra and saddle polyhedral space filling systems have been discovered. I have not attempted to exhaust ali of the possible combinations and permutations of the universal net system which will give rise to uniform or semiuniform saddle polyhedral networks. There is no question that there are additional structures to be discovered, particularly in the realm of the larger class of semiuniform networks. How many more is difficult to suggest. Table 8.1 lists 53 saddle polyhedra, ali of which relate to periodic networks which are identified in Table 8.2. Only those saddle polyhedra are described that are components of space filling systems and that are, therefore, related to the global behavior of the periodic structures to which they belong-again, a synthesis of the parts and the whole.* * No attempt has been made to consider the set of dual polyhedra for the finite saddle polyhedron cells. Because of the typical 2-connected vertices of the finite saddle polyhedron cells, their duais are not obvious andare subject to some interpretation.<br>\n <br>\n Forty-two space filling combinations are possible with the saddle pàlyhedra listed in Table 8.1. These saddle polyhedral space filling systems are enumerated in Table 8.2, and recipes for the construction of their networks using the Universal Node system are given. Models of 38 of these 42 systems are shown [8.65]-[8.96] as packings of closed polyhedra assembled from plastic surfaces, and as networks assembled from Universal Node connectors and branches. From these many examples of saddle polyhedral systems we again see the extraordinary range of options provided by the Universal Node system within the constraints of a very simple set of geometric relationships. Quite clearly, the minimum inventory/maximum diversity concept posited earlier has been powerfully fulfilled with the Universal Node system.<br>\n <br>\n *We know that a periodic network is uniform when ali of its vertices are equivalent (congruent). A semiuniform network is a system in which more than one kind of vertex appears, but which is still• periodic. Typically, semiuniform nets have two or three kinds of vertices and there are a few which have u-p to four different vertex types.<br>\n <br>\n 95<br>\n <br>\n Complete specifications of the 53 saddle polyhedra are given in Table 8.1. They are identified according to their symmetry and grouped according to the numbers of faces. Names have been derived which reflect either their symmetry properties or their origins and/or the number of faces. or ali ofthese factors. In effect, recipes are given in Table 8.1 for the construction of these saddle polyhedra using the Universal Node system. Models are shown for 38 of these 53 saddle polyhedra. Figures [8.27]-[8.64] show two views of each of these polyhedra assembled from piasti c surfaces and a third view of the network of the polyhedron assembled from Universal Node connectors and branches.<br>\n <br>\n An lnventory of Possibilities<br>\n <br>\n Table 8.1 Saddle Polyhedra Classified According to the Universal Node® System<br>\n <br>\n Symmetry Axes Saddle Polyhedron<br>\n <br>\n iComplete recipes are given for 53 saddle polyhedra. Although the list is not exhaustive it does include the most important known saddle polyhedra. The second column identifies the number o f symmetry axes each of 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotation. The third column lists the symmetry class within which each polyhedron falls. In addition to the seven c rystal classes already described, the terms triangular, digonal, and tetrahedral have also been used to indicate symmetry. Triangular refers to figures which have the symmetry of an equilateral triangular prism. Digonal refers to figures which have only a single 2-fold rotation axis. Tetrahedral refers to figures with the symmetry of the regular tetrahedron. The nodal characteristics are g iven in the fourth column. Note that ali of the saddle polyhedra have two kinds of nodes-a primary and a secondary. The secondary nodes in ali but two cases are 2-connected vertices.

106<br>\n <br>\n Saddle Polyhedra<br>\n <br>\n Unary Space Fillers and Uniform Networks<br>\n <br>\n Diverse Networks Share Common Point Lattices<br>\n <br>\n Of the 42 space filling systems that are listed in Table 8.2, we note that 14 are unary space filling saddle polyhedrawhich brings the total of ali unary space filling polyhedra we have as yet inventoried (including plane faced polyhedra) up to 35. We have seen that there are an infinite number of space fi li ing polyhedra; the significance, therefore, of newly discovered systems is a function of the ordering principies from which they are derived. The 14 unary space filling saddle polyhedra are not ali of equal stature. As I have already suggested, the bcc tetrahedron, bcc nodal octahedron, the diamond tetrahedron, and the tetrahedral decahedron are the most important of these unary systems. lncluding these four, there are 8 unary systems which define uniform networks a(\\long the 14 unary sadd Ie polyhedral space filling systems. The six remaining space filling saddle polyhedra define semiuniform networks. The total number of unary space filling saddle and flat polyhedra which define uniform nets is 13: the eight saddle polyhedra plus the cube, truncated octahedron, triangular prism, hexagonal prism and tetragonal disphenoid.<br>\n <br>\n Now that we have inventoried a vast collection of orderly spatial networks it should be useful to summarize which networks share common point lattices. As the reader should by now expect, each of the three most symmetrical point lattices-simple cubic (p), bcc, and fcc-can be alternatively interlinked with branches to form vastly different networks.<br>\n <br>\n Perhaps far more significant a concept than that of unary space filling is that of the uniform net. Our inventory shows a total of 17 uniform nets formed by the saddle polyhedra. In addition to the eight formed by unary systems, eight are formed as binary systems and one as a ternary system. lf we add to that the fourteen cubic space filling systems, ali of which are uniform nets, plus the nine uniform nets from the hexagonal class, we have a grand total of 40 uniform nets. lf we àdd the total of 42 saddle polyhedral space filling systems (uniform and semiuniform) to ali those systems previously inventoried, we find a total of 92 different space filling systems. Eighty-five of these systems may be accounted for by the Universal Node system (with topological license permitted in the hexagonal system). See Chapter 7, pp. 74-84.<br>\n <br>\n 107<br>\n <br>\n As mentioned in Chapter 6 and as shown in [8.20], ali the nades of the universal network fali at the sites of a simple cubic lattice. This fact reveals the importance and usefulness of considering spatial organization in terms of networks rather than solely in terms of lattice points. The position of points in space in no way predicts the interlinkages between points. lt is clear that a given point lattice (or point lattice subset) may be the basis of many different uniform and semiuniform networks. lt is startling to realize that the simple cubic lattice usually identified with the 6-connected cubical network gives ri se to a structure of such apparent complexity as the universal network. Another example in our inventory with its nades positioned at the sites of the simple cubic lattice is the 18/ 6-connected net found with space filling of cubical saddle hexahedra and universal tetrahedra. ([8.86], No. 27, Table 8.2.) The bcc lattice gives rise to a host of uniform and semiuniform networks. There are four uniform networks: the 14-connected tetragonal disphenoid net; the 8-connected bcc tetrahedron net ([8.67], No. 3, Table 8.2); the 10-connected triangular hexahedron net ([8.70], No. 6, Table 8.2); and the 14-connected digonal trihedron net ([8.72], Table 8.2). Among the space filling systerris dual to the regular and semiregular polyhedra space filling systems (Table 5.1 ), there are three semiuniform networks with their nades positioned on the bcc lattice, including space filling of rhombic hexahedra [5.11 b] (4/8-connected); square pyramid [5.11c], tetragonal octahedron [5.11d] and rhombic pyramid [5.11 p] (ali on the same 8/14-connected net); and, finally the right triangular pyramid [5.11 m] (24/14/8-connected).<br>\n <br>\n Common Point Lattices<br>\n <br>\n The fcc lattice can be formed by the 12connected tetrahedra/octahedra space filling system, the 6-connected tetrahedral decahedron system ([8.69], No. 5, Table 8.2), and the 8-connected fcc tetragonal tetrahedron/fcc orthorhombic tetrahedron system ([8. 76], No. 16, Table 8.2), ali of which are uniform networks. The aforementioned is not an exhaustive list of networks; in particular, many more semiuniform cases may be given. lt is interesting to note that of the alternative uniform systems, each lattice (p, bcc, fcc) accounts for a single plane-faced polyhedral system, i. e., packings of cubes (p), tetragonal disphenoids (bcc), or tetrahedra and octahedra (fcc). The remaining uniform networks are systems composed of saddle polyhedra of various kinds, again emphasizing the morphological significance of the saddle polyhedra. We will come to appreciate the saddle polyhedra even more in the next chapter as we go on to describe a special class of systems derived from the special properties of polyhedra bounded by mini mal surfaces.<br>\n <br>\n Table 8.2 Space Filling with Saddle Polyhedra<br>\n <br>\n Space Filling System I<br>\n <br>\n Decatrihedron (right) [8.65]<br>\n <br>\n 2<br>\n <br>\n Diamond tetrahedron [8.66]<br>\n <br>\n Entry in Table 8.1<br>\n <br>\n Space Filling Net Ratio Type<br>\n <br>\n z<br>\n <br>\n uniform<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n li<br>\n <br>\n uniform<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n 3 bcc tetrahedron [8.67]<br>\n <br>\n 12<br>\n <br>\n uniform<br>\n <br>\n 8<br>\n <br>\n bcc octahedron [8.68]<br>\n <br>\n 40<br>\n <br>\n uniform<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n 5 Tetrahedral decahedron [8.69]<br>\n <br>\n 43<br>\n <br>\n uniform<br>\n <br>\n 6<br>\n <br>\n 6 Triangular hexahedron [8.70]<br>\n <br>\n 27<br>\n <br>\n uniform<br>\n <br>\n 10<br>\n <br>\n 7 Truncated tetrahedral decahedron [8. 71]<br>\n <br>\n 46<br>\n <br>\n uniform<br>\n <br>\n 3<br>\n <br>\n 8 Dígonal trihedron<br>\n <br>\n 4<br>\n <br>\n uniform<br>\n <br>\n 14<br>\n <br>\n 16<br>\n <br>\n semiuniforfT)<br>\n <br>\n 6<br>\n <br>\n 8.65<br>\n <br>\n 8.66<br>\n <br>\n In this table are listed<br>\n <br>\n 8.67<br>\n <br>\n 42 space filling combinations that are possible with lhe polyhedra given in Table 8.1.
