ROSENBERG\nMIT, Department of Architecture and the Department of\nMathematics, USA\nneri@mit.edu, jessel@mit.edu\n\nAbstract. The paper unfolds the association between geometry and\nmaterial behaviour, specifically the elastic properties of resin\nimpregnated latex membranes, by means of homogenizing protocols\nwhich translate physical properties into geometrical functions. Resinimpregnation patterns are applied to 2D pre-stretched form-active\ntension systems to induce 3D curvature upon release. This method\nenables form-finding based on material properties, organization and\nbehaviour. A digital tool developed in the Processing environment\ndemonstrates the simulation of material behaviour and its prediction\nunder specific environmental conditions. Finally, conclusions are\ndrawn from the physical and digital explorations which redefine\ngenerative material-based design computation, supporting a synergetic\napproach to design integrating form, material and environment.\n\n1. Introduction\n1.2. BACKGROUND\n\n“What does a brick want to be?” In his philosophical explorations the\narchitect Louis Kahn proposed that buildings were not inert configurations\nof form but “living organic entities” (McCarter, 2005). Let us replace the\nword “brick” with the notion of “material”, and the concept of “task”, or\n“function”, with that of “performance”. Now let us speculate on how does a\nmaterial perform? Moreover, is there a way in which we could predict\nmaterial behaviour and organization within a given context? Pursuing further\nthis strand of logic, the notion of form-finding attributed to Frei Otto (1995)\nfollows Kahn’s conviction of a predetermined search for material form, but\nproduces perhaps the synergetic relationship between performance and\nmaterial integrity. Our research seeks to build upon design work based on\nphysical form-finding and to extend this to the inquiry into what the\nimplications of such experiments may be when translated from the physical\nto the digital realm. How, and indeed when, does digital matter transcend its\nrepresentational value and acquire ontological, operative and, even,\ngenerative validity for the designer in his creative search for formal,\nstructural and material integrity.\n\n6\n\n1.2. PROBLEM DEFINITION\n\nCurrent CAD applications, including associative modelling software\npackages, appear frequently to promote generative approaches to design\n(Shea, 2003). Rather then treating the computational media merely as an\n“output station” prior to production, the designer is now able to establish\nparametric relationships between features, methods and/or functions in a\nway which supports design processes of an exploratory nature. However,\nthis liberation which seems to be manifesting itself across the board\nthroughout the continuous phases of the design process is currently mainly\ndriven by geometrical constraints. Generative performative modelling\napproaches have been introduced which engage principles of engineering\nwith from-finding (Burry, 2005). And yet, even when integrating\nperformance factors and tools that are significant in determining\narchitectural form, material organization and behaviour are already predetermined design constraints; predetermined factors. Form finding, in the\ndigital realm, is thus restricted to the relationship between structure and\ngeometry (and/or fabrication); it does not generally incorporate, and/or\nsupport, the expression of material properties, organization and behaviour.\n1.3. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThis work seeks to establish a synergetic approach to design whereby\nmaterial organization and behaviour, as they may appear in the physical\nworld, may be integrated into digital tools for design exploration. The\napproach is based on the premise that material, structure, and form can\nbecome inseparable entities of the design process which relate to matter,\nperformance and geometry respectfully. Beyond this theoretical significance,\nthe goal of the experiments presented here is to effectively link the\nsimulation/computational techniques across adjacent scales of physical\nbehaviour so that microscopic level physics and mechanisms are\nincorporated into the description of properties and behaviour at the\nmesoscopic (micro-structural) level, and beyond that, in order to suggest\ndescriptive attributes even at macro scale. The paper thus presents some first\nsteps in the creation of a digital simulation tool developed in Processing\n(JAVA environment) which is informed by material behaviour and targeted\ntowards material-based design generation.\n2.\n\nIntroductory Work: Physical Experiments\n\nAs the research seeks to unfold the relationship between “curviness” and\n“stretchiness”, strategic decisions were made with regards to material\nselection. The physical experiments were executed in three groups, each\nexploring different aspects of the same phenomenon and growing in\ncomplexity. Elastic membranes made of rubber latex were selected as a\nworking material.\nThe initial experiment (Figure 1) demonstrates the behaviour of an elastic\nmembrane when upon pre-stretching, local resin impregnation is introduced\nto promote non-homogenous material distribution within the membrane\n(once released). This phenomenon is in some ways analogous to that of a\n\n7\n\nfunicular shape which is one similar to that taken by a suspended chain or\nstring subjected to a particular loading. The impregnated resin is equivalent\nto “lines of constraint or hardness” which force the membrane to remain at\nits initial (pre-stretched) length when released, and as a result induce\ncurvature upon release.\n\nFigure 1: Resin impregnated latex-membrane experiments. Left: Rapid moulds designed for\npre-stretching and impregnation. Right: Impregnation applied parallel and perpendicular to\nstretch to stretch.\n\nIn this experiment, the latex membrane is stretched in one direction and\nthe resin (“line of force”) is introduced, once parallel to the stretch, and\nagain, perpendicular to the direction of the stretch. Figure 1 illustrates the\nbasic experiment: in the left-hand image, impregnation is applied\nperpendicular to stretch direction and results in local folds along\nimpregnation after release. In the right image impregnation is applied\nparallel to stretch direction and results in global curvature of the fabric after\nrelease.\nThe next series of experiments demonstrate the relationship between the\nresin impregnated patterns applied to the pre-stretched membrane and the\nresulting curvature produced upon release.\nIn this experiment (Figure 1), the latex membrane is homogeneously\nstretched on a wooden frame (left and middle images illustrate bottom and\ntop configurations of frame); laser-cut chipboard with impregnation pattern\nis attached to the membrane and resin is applied into the “negative cutting”\npattern. Once the resin has dried, the chipboard is removed and the latex\nmembrane is released from the frame.\nEstablishing such relations between the impregnation pattern, the\ndirection of stretch, and the resulting geometry would assist in predicting the\ninduced three-dimensional form based on the two-dimensional pattern.\nTwo models were experimented with which illustrate such relations. The\nfirst employed an elliptical pattern and the second, a hyperbolic pattern, both\nof which proved to be diagnostic of essentially two different forms of global\ncurvatures: synclastic and anticlastic curvatures respectfully. In other words,\nthe impregnated pattern, by forming a composite material (resin impregnated\nlatex), promoted a non-homogeneous behaviour within this material system.\nFigure 2 illustrates the result of such an experiment: the nonhomogeneous resin pattern was applied to a homogeneously pre-tensioned\nlatex membrane. Once the stress is released, the membrane deforms\ncompletely, based on the 2D impregnation pattern, to form a 3D structure\nwith global synclastic curvature.\n\n8\n\nFigure 2: Resin impregnated latex-membrane physical experiment (left and right - frontal\nand dorsal elevation views) demonstrating curvature induced by pre-stretching.\n\n3. Simulation System Description and Implementation\nThe experiments illustrated here were developed as parallel investigations in\nthe physical and digital realms. Physical experiments were executed which\ndefined the criteria for simulation and further generation of form, based on\nmaterial behaviour under extrinsic loads as determined in the material\nexperiments. The computational tools were developed in the Processing\nenvironment, an open source programming language developed by Ben Fry\n(Broad Institute) and Casey Reas (UCLA Design, Media Arts), which\nenables ,among other things, particle system animation.\nIn this demonstration the aim was to compute material behaviour in two\nmodes: the “top-down” mode promoted the creation of a constraint space\nemulating the physical system explored. This so-called “space” is defined by\nlimited degrees of freedom (DOF) defined as geometrical constraints driven\nby physical material attributes. The “bottom-up” mode promoted the\napplication of local, and at certain cases, incremental constraints which were\nsystematically introduced to the “constraint space” to fit specific physical\nmanipulations; more on this later. Before introducing the computational\nmodel let us discuss some basic principles of the system at hand.\n3.1 DIGITAL IMPLEMENTATION AND TOOL DEVELOPMENT\n\nIn the process of converting the physical findings to digital representations,\nwhich may potentially become tools for material behaviour simulation and\nprediction, it is essential to determine the way in which ‘material behaviour’\nis coded as geometrical features, methods and functions (Hübsch, 2003).\nBoth typical cases introduced in the previous section include the\nperpendicular-to-stretch application of resin impregnation (which resulted in\npleating-like cresses formed in the direction of the stretch in the process of\ncompensating for the shortening of the membrane after release with local\nfolds/curves) and parallel to the stretch (which results in a general synclastic\nand/or monoclastic curviness of the surface as a result of the resin which\nforces the membrane to fold upon itself upon shrinkage and stress release).\nIn computational terms this phenomenon of shrinkage vs. stretching must\nbe accommodated by highly articulated “material solvers” that are capable of\nmimicking material behaviour and translating physical properties into\n\n9\n\ngeometrical attributes. The computational tool developed for material\nemulation and material-based form-generation is based on the creation of a\nparticle-spring engine built in Java. The fabric is modelled as a set of\ninterconnected particles connected by springs (particles are represented as\npoints, and springs are represented as lines connecting between those points).\n\nFigure 3: Composite image illustrating the stretch fabric simulation logic. Three underlying\ncomputational structures were modelled as the initial mesh: (a) net springs provide for the\nbasic structure (stretch); (b) diagonal springs mimic fabric behaviour (shear); (c) flex springs\nprovide for additional stiffness (bend).\n\n3.2. DEFORMING THE MESH: EXTRINSIC VS. INTRINSIC DEFORMATION:\n\nMesh deformation is carried out either by introducing extrinsic deformation\n(adding accumulative amounts of springs to the mesh locally) or by\nintroducing intrinsic deformation (modifying the characteristics of the\nsprings themselves across the surface). As the membrane strongly resists\nstretching motions while being comparatively permissive in allowing\nbending or shearing, the simulation had to account for the intrinsic forces as\nmuch as the extrinsic ones.\n\nFigure 4: Left: Gaussian curvature representation indicating areas of positive and negative\ncurvature in the mesh. Right: Increasing the length of red regions driven by a Sin^2(x) curve\nintroduces intrinsic deformation to the mesh.\n\nFigure 4 illustrates a sin function which informs the way in which the\nmesh deforms. The degree of change may potentially be modified by\napplying varied mathematical formulas.\nControlling the degree of mesh deformation by modifying the Gaussian\ncurvature of the mesh:\nThe Gaussian curvature of a surface at a point is the product of the\nprincipal curvatures at that point. The tangent plane of any point with\npositive Gaussian curvature touches the surface at a single point, whereas the\ntangent plane of any point with negative Gaussian curvature cuts the surface.\nAny point with zero mean curvature has negative or zero Gaussian curvature.\n\n10\n\nFigure 4 illustrates the colour-coded Gaussian curvature in a generic\nmesh model: Any points on the surface with curvature values between the\nvalues specified by the user will be displayed using the corresponding colour.\nFor example, points with a curvature value half way between the specified\nvalues will be green. Points on the surface that have curvature values beyond\nthe red end of the range will be red and points with curvature values beyond\nthe blue end of the range will be blue. A positive Gaussian curvature value\nmeans the surface is bowl-like (synclastic or positive curvature). A negative\nvalue means the surface is saddle-like (anticlastic or negative curvature).\n4. Tool Demonstration\nThe mesh variables include the Spring Constant (K) indicating the strength\nof the fabric, the gravity force (G) within the modelling environment, the\ntime step (T) for each increment, and the damping factor (D).\n\nFigure 5: Digital simulation of resin impregnation which is applied perpendicular (left) and\nparallel (right) to stretch\n\nThe above two experiments demonstrate the digital simulation of the\ninitial physical experiments. The top images illustrate the digital output of a\nstretch simulation which is applied to a resin-impregnated mesh where (right)\nthe resin is applied perpendicular to the stretch direction and results in local\nfolds along impregnation after release. Left: impregnation is applied parallel\nto stretch direction and results in global curvature of the fabric after release.\nCompare with Figure 1 illustrating the physical equivalent.\n\nFigure 6: Digital Simulation of Intrinsic Forces in Mesh\n\n5. Summary and Conclusions\nThe tool presented here is one of many potential applications in design\ncomputation which promotes the integration of material properties and\n\n11\n\nbehaviour alongside associative modelling environments which allow for\nstructural optimization. In doing so, it seeks to define a synergetic approach\nto generative design processes by linking the material world to that of\ngeometry and promoting design explorations of an iterative nature bridging\nphysical and digital modelling.\n5.1 FINDING-FROM\nORGANISATION\n\nBY\n\nCONTROLLING\n\nANISOTROPIC\n\nMATERIAL\n\nIsotropic materials are materials which exhibit properties with the same\nvalues when measured along axes in all directions. Anisotropic materials are\nthose which exhibit properties with different values when measured in\ndifferent directions. The level or degree of “property differentiation” may be\ndetermined across different scales of investigation. When examined both in\nthe local (molecular material composition) scale and the global scale\n(defined herein as building scale), the rubber-latex membranes exhibit\nhomogeneous properties of behaviour in all directions. The act of applying\nresin strips over the surface, given a specific pattern arrangement, creates a\nmaterial composite (resin impregnated rubber-latex) which acts in a\nheterogeneous manner when stretched and released.\n5.2 THE HOMOGENIZATION PROCESS: INTEGRATING PHYSICAL DATA\nIN DIGITAL PROTOCOLS\n\nThe process of translating physical material behaviour into digital particlesystem-based entities requires matching mathematical and geometrical\nequivalents to physical phenomenon such as stress, strain, gravity etc. This is\nwhere a structural, or rather organizational, hierarchy is needed for the\nsimulation. The notion of “homogenizing” physical parameters which are\nnot of the same order of magnitude and/or do not register, or measure, with\nthe exact same unit conventions, promotes an approach for “calibrating”\nthese orders such that they are comparable to one another.\n5.3 COMPUTATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR EMULATING\nBEHAVIOUR OF GLOBALLY MODULATED SYSTEMS\n\nPHYSICAL\n\nThe experiments illustrated in this paper demonstrate a system of materials\n(resin-impregnated rubber-latex composite) which is globally modulated\nacross its entire surface area (by pre-stretch, impregnation and release) to\npromote both global and local curvature. Two strategies in general were\ninstrumentalized to simulate the material behaviour across both local and\nglobal scales. The first strategy was to differentiate the forces of stretch\nwithin the mesh based on a given mathematical formula which was\nintegrated into the script; the second strategy was to locally add springs as\nneeded to simulate different degrees of stretch once force is applied in a nonuniform manner.\nThese two strategies promote two very different approaches to the\ncomputation of material properties. The first strategy appropriates the mesh\nin its entirety and seeks to treat it as a continuous geometrical entity\nmodulated by a global formula; the second promotes discreteness of material\nelements, which do not necessarily go hand in hand with the way in which\n\n12\n\nthe material itself is described physically. It is probably worthwhile\nemphasizing that the closer the computational strategy is to the material\nlogic, the more inherent - and thus better - it becomes. Membrane structures\nseek continuous solutions whereas component-based systems would promote\na more discrete strategy with regards to computation of material properties.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work has been carried out by the authors’ collaboration in the framework of an MIT\ncourse directed by Dr. Dennis Shelden, Chief Technology Officer of Gehry Technologies.\nThe authors also wish to thank Yanni Loukissas, teaching assistant, Dr. Axel Kilian and\nAlexandros Tsamis for their invaluable input.
