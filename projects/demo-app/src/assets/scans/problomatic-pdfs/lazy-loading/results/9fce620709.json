The context\nof this research is part of the broad and active field of Computational Micromechanics, which has emerged as an effective tool both to understand the\ninfluence of complex microstructure on the macro-mechanical response of engineering materials and to tailor-design innovative materials for specific applications through a proper modification of their microstructure.\nWhile the classical continuum approximation does not account for microstructural details within the material, computational micromechanics allows detailed modelling of a heterogeneous material’s internal structural arrangement by treating each constituent as a continuum. Such an approach\nrequires modelling a certain material microstructure by considering most of\nthe microstructure’s morphological features.\nThe most common numerical technique used in computational micromechanics analysis is the Finite Element Method (FEM). Its use has been driven\nby the development of mesh generation programs, which lead to the quasiautomatic discretisation of the artificial microstructure domain and the possibility of implementing appropriate constitutive equations for the different\nphases and their interfaces. In FEM’s applications to computational micromechanics, the phase arrangements are discretised using continuum elements.\nThe mesh is created so that element boundaries and, wherever required, special interface elements are located at all interfaces between material’s constituents. This approach can be effective in modelling many microstructures,\nand it is readily available in commercial codes. However, the need to accurately resolve the kinematic and stress fields related to complex material behaviours may lead to very large models that may need prohibitive processing\ntime despite the increasing modern computers’ performance. When rather\ncomplex microstructure’s morphologies are considered, the quasi-automatic\niii\n\niv\n\ndiscretisation process stated before might fail to generate high-quality meshes.\nTime-consuming mesh regularisation techniques, both automatic and operatordriven, may be needed to obtain accurate numeric results. Indeed, the preparation of high-quality meshes is today one of the steps requiring more attention, and time, from the analyst. In this respect, the development of computational techniques to deal with complex and evolving geometries and meshes\nwith accuracy, effectiveness, and robustness attracts relevant interest.\nThe computational framework presented in this thesis is based on the Virtual Element Method (VEM), a recently developed numerical technique that\nhas proven to provide robust numerical results even with highly-distorted\nmesh. These peculiar features have been exploited to analyse two-dimensional\nrepresentations of heterogeneous materials’ microstructures. Ad-hoc polygonal multi-domain meshing strategies have been developed and tested to\nexploit the discretisation freedom that VEM allows. To further simplify the\npreprocessing stage of the analysis and reduce the total computational cost,\na novel hybrid formulation for analysing multi-domain problems has been\ndeveloped by combining the Virtual Element Method with the well-known\nBoundary Element Method (BEM). The hybrid approach has been used to\nstudy both composite material’s transverse behaviour in the presence of inclusions with complex geometries and damage and crack propagation in the\nmatrix phase. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the potential\nof the developed framework.\n\nContents\n1 Introduction\n1.1 Numerical methods in micromechanics . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1.2 A key issue in computational micromechanics . . . . . . . . . .\n1.3 Content of the thesis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n1\n2\n3\n6\n\n2 The Virtual Element Method\n2.1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.2 Governing equations for 2D linear elasticity . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.2.1 Strong form . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.2.2 Weak form . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.3 VEM formulation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.3.1 Domain partition and discrete weak form . . . . . . . . .\n2.3.2 Virtual space and degrees of freedom . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.3.3 Projection operator . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.3.4 Virtual element stiffness matrix . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.3.5 Loading vectors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.3.6 Assembly of global system . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.3.7 Strains and Stresses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.4 VESTA - A Virtual Element toolbox . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.5 VEM implementation aspects . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.6 Linear patch test . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n9\n9\n12\n12\n14\n14\n15\n16\n18\n21\n25\n25\n26\n27\n29\n30\n\n3 Computational homogenization of composite and heterogeneous materials\n35\n3.1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35\n3.2 Multi-domain implementation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36\n3.2.1 Polycrystalline materials . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\n3.2.2 Unidirectional fibre-reinforced composite materials . . . 42\nv\n\nvi\n\nCONTENTS\n\n3.3\n\n3.4\n4\n\n5\n\nComputational homogenization tests . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n3.3.1 Computational homogenization of FCC polycrystals . .\n3.3.2 Computational homogenization of fibre-reinforced composites . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nDiscussion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nA hybrid virtual-boundary element formulation\n4.1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.2 Reference morphology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.3 Boundary integral formulation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.3.1 Somigliana identity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.3.2 Kelvin fundamental solutions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.3.3 Displacement Boundary Integral Equation . . . . . . . .\n4.3.4 The Boundary Element Method . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.3.5 Displacements and stresses within BEM domains . . . .\n4.4 VEM-BEM coupling . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.5 Analysis of a microstructure with multiple inclusions . . . . . .\n4.5.1 Benchmark finite element solutions . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.5.2 Virtual element solutions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.5.3 Hybrid virtual-boundary element solutions . . . . . . . .\n4.6 Computational homogenization of fibre-reinforced composites\nvia the hybrid VEM-BEM approach . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4.7 Key features of the hybrid VEM-BEM formulation . . . . . . . .\n\n46\n47\n49\n50\n57\n57\n60\n62\n63\n64\n65\n67\n68\n69\n72\n73\n76\n78\n81\n85\n\nDamage and fracture damage in heterogeneous materials via the hybrid VEM-BEM approach\n93\n5.1 Crack propagation in FRC . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 94\n5.1.1 Modelling approach . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 94\n5.1.2 Numerical example . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 96\n5.2 Applications of an isotropic damage model . . . . . . . . . . . . 101\n5.2.1 VEM for domains exhibiting isotropic damage . . . . . . 101\n5.2.2 Regularisation techniques . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 105\n5.2.3 Numerical examples . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 109\n\nConclusions\n\n121\n\nChapter 1\n\nIntroduction\nModern advanced structural components’ behaviour strongly relies on the tailored behaviour of their constituent material. Since the properties of a material at a certain scale depend on the features of and mutual interactions among\nthe material constituents at lower scales [136], an effective way to obtain a\ndesired macroscopically response is to enhance a base material’s properties\nby altering its microstructure. Therefore, materials with highly complex microstructures are frequently developed for many modern engineering structures.\nConcurrently, the design of structures for advanced engineering applications requires a full understanding of a component response to different operational and environmental conditions. Usually, the knowledge of their failure\nmechanisms is of paramount importance. Component level phenomenological models may not always predict complex materials behaviours, especially\nif damage initiation and evolution are of concern. Today, it is widely recognised that these aspects may be better understood if the material microstructure features are considered and brought into the modelling framework. The\nlink between microstructure and material macroscopic properties is technologically interesting as it may provide valuable information for the design of\nenhanced materials. The ability to understand, explain and predict macroscopic material properties from a suitable description of the micro-scale is of\nrelevant technological interest, especially in connection with the contemporary availability of manufacturing technologies offering a tighter control on\nthe microstructure of the material.\nIn the ambitious paradigm known as materials-by-design, the much soughtafter capability of modelling materials ab initio, i.e. starting from the smallest\n1\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nnano-scales, exploiting first principles, such as quantum mechanics, should\nenable the design of materials with properties tailored to specific applications.\nIn the last few decades, remarkable developments in experimental materials characterisation have contributed to the development of the materials by\ndesign paradigm [5], which aims at developing novel and sustainable materials with desired optimal features by combining elementary constituents in a\nbottom-up approach using a variety of production techniques.\nA pillar of such a paradigm is provided by the capability of multi-scale\nmaterials characterisation and modelling [167] that, by embodying deeper and\nricher layers of information about the materials hierarchical organisation, often spanning several different scales, contribute to the understanding of complex material/structural behaviours and to the design of novel high-performance\napplications, with apparent technological benefits. In such a context, the possibility of modelling, with acceptable fidelity, the microstructure of a considered material, and the complex interactions between its building blocks, plays\na fundamental role. However, the inclusion of deeper layers of fidelity requires the ability to robustly address several kinds of modelling complexities,\nincluding those arising, for example, from the need to represent involved material morphological details, which may also present statistical variability.\nTo reduce the costs of experimental characterisation techniques, prediction of new material’s behaviour can be performed by numerical simulation,\nwith the primary goal being to accelerate trial and error experimental testing [186]. The recent substantial increase in computational power available\nfor mathematical modelling and simulation raises the possibility that modern numerical methods can play a significant role in analysing heterogeneous\nmicrostructures with enhanced efficiency.\n\n1.1\n\nNumerical methods in micromechanics\n\nComputational micromechanics has emerged as a consistent framework supporting the understanding of the link between the material microstructure\nand its macroscopic properties, i.e. the structure-property relationship. The field\nhas enormously benefited from the rapid advancements of experimental techniques for materials microscopic characterisation and reconstruction, able to\nprovide a wealth of useful processable information, and from the increased\naffordability of high-performance computing (HPC), which provide the complementary ability to combine and to process such information towards a better understanding, prediction and manipulation raising the possibility that\n\n1.2 A key issue in computational micromechanics\n\n3\n\nmodern numerical methods can play a significant role in analysing heterogeneous microstructures with enhanced efficiency. In this respect, the development of computational techniques to deal with complex and evolving geometries and meshes with accuracy, effectiveness, and robustness attracts relevant\ninterest.\nThe Finite Element Method (FEM) is the most popular technique used in\ncomputational micromechanics analysis and has been extensively used to investigate several kinds of materials, including polycrystalline [23, 72, 101, 154]\nand composite materials [91, 130, 131]. Its extensive use has been driven\nby the development of mesh generation programs, which lead to the quasiautomatic discretisation of the artificial microstructure domain.\nIn FEM’s applications to computational micromechanics, the phase arrangements are discretised using continuum elements and the mesh is created\nso that element boundaries and, wherever required, special interface elements\nare located at all interfaces between material’s constituents. This approach\ncan be effective in modelling many microgeometries, and it is available in\ncommercial codes.\nFEM is also popular because of its capabilities in nonlinear analyses where\nits flexibility and capability of supporting a wide range of constitutive descriptions for the constituents and the interfaces between can be exploited\ntrough the possibility of implementing appropriate constitutive equations for\nthe different phases and their interfaces. Constitutive models for constituents\nused in FEM-based micromechanics have included a wide range of elastoplastic, viscoelastic, viscoelastoplastic and continuum damage mechanics descriptions as well as crystal plasticity models [127], and nonlocal models [25].\nBesides, FEM has supported a range of modelling options for interfaces between phases.\nHowever, the need to accurately resolve the kinematic and stress fields related to complex material behaviours with a conformal discretisation of the\ndomain that retains proper topological features may lead to very large models that may need prohibitive processing time despite the increasing modern\ncomputers’ performance.\n\n1.2\n\nA key issue in computational micromechanics\n\nOne of the key aspects in the effective modelling of materials micromechanics\nis the availability of a suitable representation of the material micromorphology. This can be based either the computer reconstruction of real microstruc-\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\ntures or on the generation of artificial models embodying the relevant statistical features of the microstructural aggregate, which may exhibit involved\nshapes. The potential presence of complex morphological features has a direct\neffect on the complexity of the numerical grid, or mesh, used to discretise the\nconsidered boundary value problem. Examples of actual complex morphologies for two types of composite materials are shown in Fig.(1.1) and Fig.(1.2).\nThe quality of the mesh, in turn, may have an important effect on the accuracy\nof the numerical reconstruction of the mechanical fields.\n\nFigure 1.1: Cross section micrograph of a UD AS4/8552 composite [88].\nWhen rather complex microstructure’s morphologies are considered, the\nquasi-automatic discretisation process described before might fail to generate\nhigh-quality meshes. Time-consuming mesh regularisation techniques, both\nautomatic and operator-driven, may be needed to obtain accurate numeric\nresults. Indeed, the preparation of high-quality meshes is today one of the\nsteps requiring more attention, and time, from the analyst [149, 150].\nBesides FEM, many numerical techniques have been employed for con-\n\n1.2 A key issue in computational micromechanics\n\n5\n\nFigure 1.2: Microstructure of a A359/SiCp metal–matrix composite (MMC)\n[66].\n\ntinuum micromechanical studies of discrete microstructures, including Finite\nDifference (FD) [2] and Finite Volume algorithms [22, 147] and spring lattice models [141]. FEM derived techniques such the extended finite element\nmethod (X-FEM) [164, 163] and the scaled boundary finite element method\n(SBFEM)[38] have also been employed. Other popular numerical approaches\nrely on the use of meshfree methods [67, 176] and the Boundary Element\nMethod. The latter has been extensively used for micromechanical studies on\ncomposite materials [1, 69, 113, 114] and polycrystalline materials [79, 84, 49,\n47] because it allows reducing the problem dimensionality as a direct consequence of the underlying integral formulation, with the consequent reduction\nin the number of degrees of freedom required in the analysis simplification\nand such a feature may result particularly appealing when materials morphologies with high statistical variability have to be automatically generated,\nmeshed and analysed [46].\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nGiven the considerations outlined above, the development of computational techniques capable of dealing with complex and evolving geometries\nand meshes with accuracy, effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness is still of\nrelevant interest.\nThe computational framework presented in this thesis is based on the Virtual Element Method (VEM), a recently developed numerical technique which\nhas already proven to provide robust numerical results even with highlydistorted mesh.\nIn this thesis, attention is focused on continuum micromechanics, i.e. on the\nstudy of materials whose basic building blocks, e.g. individual crystals, fibres\nor matrix, can be modelled resorting to the continuum idealisation. In particular, the research focus is on polycrystalline materials and fibre-reinforced\ncomposites that are two classes of materials widely employed in engineering applications. In polycrystalline materials, the availability of information\nabout the grains’ mechanical properties and their inter-granular interfaces,\ntheir crystallographic orientation and size distribution can be conveniently\nexploited to predict the aggregate’s properties and suggest potential manufacturing pathways for material optimisation [48]. Analogously, the knowledge\nof the properties of carbon fibres, epoxy matrix and the characterisation of the\nfibre-matrix interface can be used to investigate the effectiveness of different\nfibre arrangements on composite laminates’ structural performances [85, 129].\nBoth materials present morphologies that may become challenging to model\ngiven the microstructure’s representation’s complex shapes.\nThe hypothesis that VEM’s peculiar features could be exploited to analyse\ntwo-dimensional representations of heterogeneous materials’ microstructures\nefficiently forms the basis of this research work. To further simplify the preprocessing stage of the analysis and reduce the total computational cost, a\nnovel hybrid formulation for analysing multi-domain problems is developed\nand employed by combining the Virtual Element Method with the Boundary\nElement Method. The hybrid approach will be used to study both composite\nmaterial’s transverse behaviour in the presence of inclusions with complex\ngeometries and damage and crack propagation in the matrix phase.\n\n1.3\n\nContent of the thesis\n\nThe following Chapters of this thesis are organised as follows.\nChapter (2) introduces the main features of the Virtual Element Method\n(VEM).

Insights of the in-house developed code are given while discussing some specific implementation aspects of the VEM formulation previously introduced.\nChapter (3) presents an application of the Virtual Element Method for\ncomputational homogenisation of composite and heterogeneous materials.\nThe reported applications are focused on modelling the transverse mechanical behaviour of polycrystalline and unidirectional fibre-reinforced composite\nmaterials exploiting VEM’s flexibility in the analysis of randomly generated\nand meshed microstructures.\nIn Chapter (4), a novel two-dimensional hybrid virtual-boundary element\nformulation is presented. Numerical tests are performed to assess its accuracy\nusing a representative test case. The application of such a novel formulation\nto the computational homogenisation problem of a composite material with\nrandomly distributed inclusions of complex shape is also reported.\nChapter (5) is meant to introduce further applications of the hybrid VEMBEM formulation for modelling damage phenomena in composite materials.\nEventually, the last Chapter summarises and discusses the research work\noutcome, providing suggestions for future work on the topic.\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Virtual Element Method\nThe present Chapter is intended to introduce the displacement-based lowestorder VEM formulation for two-dimensional linear elasticity problems, setting the framework of this thesis’s ensuing developments. Section 2.1 is devoted to introduce the core idea of the method and its peculiar features. A\nselected list of references is also provided to the interested reader that comprise both the method’s fundamentals and its most prominent scientific application to date. Section 2.2 recalls both the strong and weak form of the\ngoverning equations for two-dimensional linear elasticity. Section 2.3 recalls\nthe lowest-order displacement-based VEM formulation for two-dimensional\nlinear elasticity problems and details the construction of all the VEM approximation scheme components. Section 2.4 introduces VESTA, the virtual element\nprogram that has been developed and used to perform all the analysis of the\npresent thesis. In Section 2.5 some aspects of the implementation of the VEM\nformulation are discussed. Eventually, Section 2.6 presents a numerical example used to assess VEM’s accuracy in reproducing an exact linear solution\neven with heavily distorted mesh.\n\n2.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Virtual Element Method (VEM) [31] is a numerical technique used to find\napproximate solutions to problems described by partial differential equations.\nVEM can be considered as a generalisation of the Finite Element Method\n(FEM), a powerful and well established numerical technique that is used in\na large number of engineering applications.\n9\n\n10\n\nThe Virtual Element Method\n\nFEM’s common approach involves discretising a continuous domain into\na set of discrete sub-domains that is usually referred to as a mesh. In the case of\ntwo and three-dimensional domains, the mesh is usually constructed with triangular or tetrahedral and quadrilateral or hexahedral elements while the use\nof general polygonal and polyhedral meshes is rather uncommon in industrial applications. Nevertheless, there are some advantages in using polygonal/polyhedral meshes over the simpler ones, the most important of which\nare a significant simplification of the partitioning of the domain even for very\ncomplex geometries and a reduction of the complexity of adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening algorithms as no special treatment of hanging nodes\nare required to maintain the conformity of the mesh.\nWhile the use of polygonal and polyhedral meshes for the approximate solution of boundary value problems is well established in the literature [165] it\nturns out that extending FEM to general polygonal/polyhedral meshes leads\nto very complex and computationally expensive schemes. This is because the\nconstruction of the basis functions on elements with a very general shape is a\nnon-trivial and complex task [36].\nVEM most appealing feature is its capability to use polytopal mesh (polygons in two dimensions or polyhedra in three dimensions). An example of a\nVEM two-dimensional polygonal discretisation is shown in Fig.(2.2). Despite,\nits rather recent introduction, VEM has already proven to be able to provide\naccurate results in several class of engineering problems even in the presence\nof severe mesh distortions. At the same time, as will be shown later in this\nChapter, VEM allows treating irregularly shaped elements with relative simplicity and efficiency.\nThe possibility of using meshes with elements of arbitrary shape is certainly one of the most evident features of VEM. This features allows VEM to\nmanage meshes which in the standard FEM are considered non-conformal.\nAn example of non-conformal mesh is shown in Fig.(2.1). These meshes are\noften generated during adaptive refining and may include the presence of socalled hanging-nodes (red nodes in the figure). VEM straightforwardly treats\nhanging nodes introduced by the refinement of a neighbouring element as\nnew element nodes since the VEM formulation admits adjacent co-planar element interfaces. The adaptive process results, in fact, in a VEM-conforming\nmesh. A mesh adaptivity process could also involve a coarsening process, frequent in the numerical solution of evolution PDEs where it is standard practice to efficiently track evolving fronts and singularities. Adaptive coarsening\ncould be interpreted as the opposite process of mesh refining and could be\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\n11\n\nexemplified by reading Fig.(2.1) from right to left. In such a context, VEM\nallows a rather straightforward and inexpensive implementation as node removal does not necessitate any further local mesh modification. In general,\nVEM’s mesh flexibility may have the potential to provide complexity reduction with respect to standard FEM.\n\nFigure 2.1: Example of an adaptive mesh refinement process that involve the\ngeneration of hanging nodes (marked in red).\nThe VEM has been first introduced as an evolution of the Mimetic Finite Difference (MFD) method [57, 111], inheriting the capability of obtaining robust approximate solutions of boundary value problems even on unstructured meshes whose elements may have very general geometries. By\nexploiting the aforementioned intrinsic capabilities, the VEM has been successfully applied to general linear elasticity [34, 76, 13], inelastic materials at\nsmall strains [37, 14], hyper-elastic materials at finite strains [178, 62], contact\nmechanics [179], topology optimization [75, 11], magneto-static problems [32,\n33], geomechanical simulations of reservoir models [9], damage and fracture\nanalysis [68, 6, 52, 138, 93, 17] and plate bending problems [58, 182, 183, 133,\n30]. The possibility of using virtual elements of general shape, also highly distorted, makes VEM particularly interesting for applications where the meshed\ndomain may undergo large deformations [174].\nAnother interesting application of VEM is to micromechanics problems\nwhere the occurrence of problematic morphological features, likely sources\nof mesh irregularities, may not be a priori excluded: a typical example is\nprovided by problems of statistical homogenisation, where a relevant number of random unit cells is generated and analysed with the aim of inferring\nthe emerging material properties through volume averaging techniques. The\napplication of VEM to micromechanics problems are rather recent [12, 16,\n\n12\n\nThe Virtual Element Method\n\n177, 124] and represent the core research work reported in the present thesis\n[116, 117, 118].\n\nFigure 2.2: An example of a two-dimensional polygonal discretization of a\nrectangular plate with a circular hole.\n\n2.2\n\nGoverning equations for 2D linear elasticity\n\n2.2.1\n\nStrong form\n\nLet continuous body occupying Ω ∈ R2 a two-dimensional region bounded\nby the curve Γ ≡ ∂Ω in a reference system ( x, y).\nThe strong formulation of the small strains elastic problem is based on the use\nof the strain-displacement equations\nε ij (u) =\n\n\"\n1!\nui,j + u j,i ,\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\nof the linear elastic constitutive laws\n\nσij = Cijkl ε kl ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nand of the indefinite equilibrium equations\nσij,j + f i = 0,\n\n(2.3)\n\n2.2 Governing equations for 2D linear elasticity\n\n13\n\n#\n$!\nwhere u = u x , uy represents the displacement vector field, ε ij are the components of the strain tensor, σij are the components of the stress tensor, Cijkl\nare the stiffness tensor components and f i are the components of volume distributes loads.

With the sole aim of simplifying the formal introduction of\nthe method, in Eq.(2.13) it has been assumed that the displacements u vanish\nalong the boundary Γ of the analysed domain. As it will be recalled later in\nthis Section, this assumption does not affect the generality of the formulation:\nindeed, due to the choice of the element-wise virtual space of admissible displacements, see Section 2.3.2, either non-homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann\nboundary conditions can be implemented following the same procedure as in\nthe standard finite element method [13].\nDefining integral operators\nL (u, v) :=\n\n*\n\nΩ\n\nε(v)!

Such additional functions are explicitly known only over the element edges while, within each element, they\nare not explicitly known and never computed, which justifies the adjective\nvirtual referred to the method. The implicit definition of virtual functions\ndoes not allow the computation of their values or their gradients’ values in\nany element interior point. VEM resorts to a projection operator to obtain an\napproximate polynomial expression of the strains associated with the virtual\nfunctions, thus obtaining a computable approximation of the internal virtual\nwork. Through a particular choice of the element degrees of freedom, such\nprojection is exactly computed as a function of the degrees of freedom themselves, without actually solving the local boundary value problem. In the\nparticular case of the VEM lowest-order formulation, as it will be shown later\nin this Chapter, the aforementioned VEM approach results in a computational\ncost that, in terms of generation of the problem’s system of equations, is faster\nthan FEM’s standard quadrilateral isoparametric elements and it is comparable to FEM’s simplicial elements.\n\n2.3.1\n\nDomain partition and discrete weak form\n\nThis Section introduces the discrete form of the problem and the notations\nused throughout this thesis when referring to a generic polygonal virtual element. As in standard FEM procedures, the weak form in Eq.(2.16) is employed to build an approximate solution to the elastic boundary-value problem. For this purpose, the domain Ω is sub-divided into a set Ωh of finite nonoverlapping elements E ∈ Ωh , mutually interconnected at the nodal points\nlying on their edges. The superscript h refers to the association to a discretization of the domain Ω, which is parametrized by a characteristic length scale\nh.\nOnce the discretisation Ωh is identified, a function space V h ⊂ V constituting a finite-dimensional approximation of V can be associated to it. The\nGalerkin approximation of the problem is provided by uh ∈ V h such that\nL (uh , vh ) = G (vh )\n\n∀vh ∈ V h ,\n\n(2.17)\n\nwhere the integral operators can be split into elemental contributions LE (·, ·)\n\n16\n\nThe Virtual Element Method\n\nand GE (·) as\nh\n\n∑ LE (u , v ) = ∑\n\nh\n\nh\n\nL (u , v ) =\n\nh\n\nE∈Ωh\n\nand\n\nE∈Ωh\n\nh\n\nG (v ) =\n\n*\n\nE\n\n∑ GE (v ) = ∑\nh\n\nE∈Ωh\n\nE∈Ωh\n\nε(vh )!

Moreover, two consecutive edges of an element are allowed to form a straight angle.\nIn the following, for a generic element E, | E| will denote the area of the el+\n,T\nement, h E its diameter, ∂E the element boundary and nE = n x ny the unit\nnormal vector to ∂E. The counter-clockwise ordered vertices vi , i = 1, 2..., m,\nhave coordinates xi = { xi , yi } and their local scaled coordinates are defined by\nξi =\n\nxi − x E\n,\nhE\n\nηi =\n\nyi − y E\n.\nhE\n\n(2.20)\n\nThe symbol ei , i = 1, 2..., m will refer to the edge having vi as its first vertex,\nsee Fig.(2.3).\n\n2.3.2\n\nVirtual space and degrees of freedom\n\nThis Section introduces the local and global space for the vector valued test\nVEM functions and the associated degrees of freedom for the general VEM\nformulation of order k. The local discrete virtual space of order k of the admissible displacements is defined for the generic element E as [34]\nh\n\nh\n\n-\n\n1\n\nV ( E) := {v ∈ H ( E)\n\n.2\n\n: ∆vh ∈ [P k−2 ( E)]2 , v|he ∈ [P k (e)]2 ∀e ∈ ∂E} (2.21)\n\nExpression (2.21) uses the following notations:\n• H 1 ( E) is the first order Sobolev space;\n• ∆ denotes the component-wise Laplace operator;\n• k ∈ N is the degree of accuracy of the method;\n\n2.3 VEM formulation\n\n17\n\nv4\ne4\n\nv5\n\ne3\nv3\n\ne5\nE\nv6\n\ne2\ne6\n\nv1\ne1\n\nv2\n\nFigure 2.3: Example of a generic VEM element.\n2\n\n• [P k (•)] denotes the space of vector polynomials of degree up to k defined on (•), with the convention that P −1 = {0}.\nThe definition (2.21) states that a function vh ∈ V h ( E) has the following properties:\n• vh is a vector valued continuous functions on E;\n• vh is a vector polynomial of degree ≤ k on each edge e of E;\n• ∆vh is a vector polynomial of degree k − 2 in E when k > 1 and it is\nequal to zero when k = 1.\nAccording to the definition in Eq.(2.21), the local space contains all polynomials of degree up to k plus other functions that are well defined but are not\nexplicitly known inside the element but only on the element boundary. The\nname virtual for the space V h ( E) comes from the fact that, differently from\nstandard FE method, the above definition of the local displacement approximation is not fully explicit.\nThe global virtual element space can be defined based on the local space as\n\nV h := {v ∈ V : v|hE ∈ V h ( E) ∀ E ∈ Ωh }.\n\n(2.22)\n\n18\n\nThe Virtual Element Method\n\nAny function vh ∈ V h is univocally defined by the following set of degrees\nof freedom\n• the values of vh at the m vertexes of the polygon E;\n• for k ≥ 2, the values of vh at k − 1 internal points on every edge e ∈ ∂E,\nthis points can be chosen according to the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature\nrule with k + 1 points.\n• for k ≥ 2, the moments |E1 |\n\n/\n\nE\n\np · vh dE\n\n∀ p ∈ [P k−2 ( E)]2 .\n\nIn the lowest-order VEM formulation (k = 1), V h ( E) is a space of harmonic\nvector valued functions that are piecewise linear (edge by edge) and continuous on the boundary of the element and the associated degrees of freedom are\nthe the values of vh at the m vertexes of the polygon E and, since vh ∈ V h ( E)\nis linear on each edge, the value of vh at every point along the boundary ∂E\ncan be determined.\n\n2.3.3\n\nProjection operator\n\nThis Section introduces the definition and describe the computational implementation of the projection operator that plays a fundamental role in the Virtual Element Method.\nIn the previous section it has been shown that the functions of the local\nvirtual space V h ( E) are not explicitly known inside the generic element E.\nConsequently, the local discrete bilinear form LE (·, ·) cannot be computed by\nstandard numerical integration, as usually done in FEM.\nFor this purpose, the virtual element approximation employs a polynomial projector operator Π, defined on E, ∀vh ∈ V h ( E) by the orthogonality\ncondition\n*\n.\n!\nh\nh\np Π(v ) − ε(v ) dE = 0 ∀ p ∈ [ P0 ( E)]3 ,\n(2.23)\nE\n\nwhich identifies Π(vh ) as a polynomial approximation of the strains field associated to the unknown displacements vh , so that the error with respect to the\napproximated strain field ε(vh ) has no components along the space of polynomial of order k − 1 over E. Having p constant components when k = 1,\nEq.(2.23) simplifies to\n*\n1\nh\nΠ(v ) =\nε(vh ) dE.\n(2.24)\n| E| E\n\n2.3 VEM formulation\n\n19\n\nIn the following Section it will be shown how to compute the right-hand side\nof Eq.(2.24).\nProjector operator matrix\nTo be effectively employed, the projector operator must be computed in a\ndiscrete form. To do so, each function vh ∈ V h ( E), whose explicit expression\nis unknown, can be thought as\nvh = N ṽ,\nwhere\n\n+\n,!\nṽ = ṽ x1 ṽy1 . . . . . . ṽ xm ṽym ,\n\n(2.25)\n(2.26)\n\ncollects the point-wise values of vh associated with the element vertices. The\nmatrix N ∈ R2×2m collects the virtual shape functions Ni , associated with each\nvertex i of the element E. It has the following structure\n0\n1\nN1 0 N2 0 . . . . . . Nm 0\nN=\n,\n(2.27)\n0 N1 0 N2 . . . . . . 0 Nm\nwhich remarks its analogy to the shape function matrix operator of a standard displacement-based finite element formulation. It’s worth noting that\nthe functional entries of the matrix N are never analytically known at the interior points of the generic element; only their restriction to the element edges\nis explicitly known, due to the features of the space V h ( E) defined in Section\n2.3.2. Moreover, each virtual shape function Ni associated to a vertex vi is endowed with the usual Kronecker delta property of having value 1 at vertex\nvi and 0 at any other vertex. Here, along the lines of Ref.[13], the expression\nin Eq.(2.25) is introduced to allow a formal presentation of the method more\nsuited to readers with an engineering background, thus familiar with the concept of shape functions.\nEmploying Eq.(2.25) in Eq.(2.24), and considering the strain-displacement\nrelationship in Eq.(2.7), yields\n2*\n3\n*\n1\n1\nΠ(vh ) =\nD (Nṽ) dE =\nDn · N d∂E ṽ = Π ṽ,\n(2.28)\n| E| E\n| E|\n∂E\nwhere the boundary integral appearing in the third term has been obtained\napplying the Green’s theorem to the domain integral and the operator Dn has\nbeen defined in Eq.(2.12).\n\n20\n\nThe Virtual Element Method\n\nEq.(2.28) defines the discrete projector operator Π ∈ R3×2m as\n1\nΠ=\n| E|\n\n*\n\n1 m\nDn · N d∂E =\n| E| k∑\n∂E\n=1\n\n*\n\nek\n\nDn · N ds,\n\n(2.29)\n\nFrom Eq.(2.29), it follows that the discrete projector operator has the following\nexplicit matrix form\n⎡\n⎤\nπ1x 0 π2x 0 . . . . . . πmx\n0\n0\nπmy ⎦ ,\nΠ = ⎣ 0 π1y 0 π2y . . . . . .\n(2.30)\nπ1y π1x π2y π2x . . . . . . πmy πmx\nwhere the generic coefficient πix can be expressed as\n1 m i\nπix =\nnx\n| E| i∑\n=1\n\n*\n\nei\n\nNi ds.\n\n(2.31)\n\nA similar expression can be used for the generic coefficient πiy\n1 m i\nπiy =\nny\n| E| i∑\n=1\n\n*\n\nei\n\nNi ds,\n\n(2.32)\n\nnix and niy are the components of the unit outward normal vector to the edge ei .\nRecalling the Kronecker delta property of the virtual shape functions, according to which the integral of the generic virtual shape function Ni is not null\nonly on the edges adjacent to vertex i, the sum of the edge integrals appearing in Eqs.(2.31) and (2.32) can be further simplified leading to the following\nexpressions for the coefficients of the projection operator matrix Π\n0\n1\n*\n*\n1\ni −1\ni\nπix =\nn\nN ds + n x\nNi ds\n| E | x ei −1 i\nei\n(2.33)\n.\n1 - i −1\ni\n=\nn | ei −1 | + n x | ei | ,\n2| E | x\n0\n1\n*\n*\n1\ni −1\ni\nπiy =\nNi ds + ny\nNi ds\nn\n| E| y\nei −1\nei\n(2.34)\n.\n1 - i −1\ni\n=\nn | ei −1 | + n y | ei | ,\n2| E | y\n\nwhere |ei | is the length of the i-th edge. It’s worth highlighting that Eqs.(2.33)\nand (2.34) allow the explicit computation of the discrete projector operator Π\ndirectly from geometric considerations.\n\n2.3 VEM formulation\n\n2.3.4\n\n21\n\nVirtual element stiffness matrix\n\nThe construction of the virtual element approximation of the local symmetric\nbilinear form LE (·, ·) appearing in Eq.(2.18) is based on the following local\ndecomposition [31]\n4\n5 *\n4\n5\nh\nh h\nh !\nh\nh h\nLE u , v =\nΠ(v ) C Π(u ) dE + s E u , v ,\n(2.35)\nE\n\ndefined ∀ E ∈ Ωh and ∀ uh , vh ∈ V h ( E). Eq.(2.35) is the sum of two terms,\nrespectively related to the consistency and stability property of the method and\nin Ref.[31, 34]) it has been demonstrated that such decomposition guarantees\nthe convergence of the virtual element method.\nThe first term on the right-hand side of Eq.(2.35) is the bilinear form associated to the linear displacements and constant strain modes that ensures\nconsistency. The approximation LEh (·, ·) is said to be linear consistent if the\nexact bilinear form LE (·, ·) is recovered when the first entry is a linear polynomial [37]\n4\n5\n4\n5\nLEh p, vh = LE p, vh\n∀ p ∈ [P1 ( E)]2 , ∀vh ∈ V h ( E),\n(2.36)\nIn other words, if the solution of the original problem is globally a linear polynomial, then the discrete solution and the exact solution coincide. Thus, the\nconsistency matrix ensures that a virtual element is capable of exactly representing a constant strain state (linear displacement field), passing the linear\npatch test [26].\nThe consistency term uses the local projector defined in Eq.(2.24) and leads\nto the definition of the element consistency stiffness matrix KcE ∈ R2m×2m . In\nfact, using Eq.(2.28), such a term can be approximated as\n2*\n3\n*\nh !\nh\n!\n!\nΠ(v ) C Π(u ) dE = ṽ\nΠ C Π dE ũ = ṽ! KcE ũ,\n(2.37)\nE\n\nE\n\nwhich, being the integrand constant over E, readily gives the consistency stiffness matrix\nKcE = | E| Π! C Π.\n(2.38)\nThe second term on the right-hand side of Eq.(2.35) is the bilinear form associated to the non-polynomial terms or higher-order terms and leads to the\ndefinition of the element stability stiffness matrix KsE ∈ R2m×2m . The stability term is necessary for the virtual element approximation scheme since the\n\n22\n\nThe Virtual Element Method\n\nconsistency term alone cannot suppress the development of hourglass modes,\nnonphysical, zero-energy modes of deformation that produce zero strain and\nno stress and usually develop in under-integrated finite elements [40].\nAn algebraic interpretation of the hourglass modes’ appearing may be\ngiven by considering the structure of the consistency stiffness matrix Kc . For\na generic virtual element with m vertices, a system of 2m equations has to be\nsolved for the 2m unknowns given by the vertex values of the displacement\ncomponents. By using the constitutive equations once per element, 3 independent relations can be supplemented. Thus, the stiffness matrix has 2m − 3\nequations that are not independent. By fixing the 3 zero-energy modes corresponding to the 3 rigid body modes (two translations and one rotation), other\n3 independent relations can be supplemented leaving with 2m − 6 equations\nthat are not independent. When the considered polygonal virtual element is a\ntriangle, the total number of equations is 2m = 6, the consistency matrix has\nproper rank and no hourglass instability can arise. However, when considering polygonal virtual elements with 4 or more vertices, 2m = 6 zero-energy\nmodes can develop, thus requiring a stabilization term that ensures proper\nrank of the virtual element stiffness matrix.\nWithin VEM’s literature, there exist different approaches to construct the\nstability term. Whatever the approach adopted, the stability term must correct\nthe consistency term in such a way that (a) the resulting bilinear form is stable,\n(b) consistency is not affected, (c) the correction is computable using only the\ndegrees of freedom.\nIn this thesis, the approach introduced in Ref.[34] has been used. The\napproximated constant strain field computed trough the projector operator\nmatrix using Eq.(2.28) is not compatible with the boundary piece-wise linear\napproximation of the virtual displacement field unless the number of element\nvertices m is equal to 3. In fact, such a displacement field could generate deformation modes of a higher order than the constant ones. Those modes are\nneglected by the consistent term of the virtual approximation of the bilinear\nform. However, the approximate strain field Π(vh ) obtained from the projection operation is compatible with a linear displacement field uc that can be\nexpressed as\nuc = P (ξ, η ) a,\nwhere\n\n0\n\n1\n1 0 ξ 0 η 0\nP (ξ, η ) =\n,\n0 1 0 ξ 0 η\n\n(2.39)\n\n(2.40)\n\n2.3 VEM formulation\n\n23\n\nis a matrix of polynomial basis functions, ξ and η are the local scaled coordinates defined in Eq.(2.20) and\n+\n,!\na = a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 ,\n(2.41)\nis a vector of constant coefficients. The compatible displacements uc can be\nevaluated at the i-th vertex of a generic virtual element E as\nuic = P (ξ i , ηi ) a,\n\n(2.42)\n\nThe components of the compatible displacements at all the element vertices\ncan be collected in the vector\nũc = D a.\n(2.43)\nwhere D ∈ R2m×6 is the matrix obtained assembling the matrices P (ξ i , ηi ) and\nwhose explicit expression is\n⎡\n⎤\n1 0 ξ 1 0 η1 0\n⎢ 0 1 0 ξ 1 0 η1 ⎥\n⎥\n⎢\n⎢ .. .. ..\n.\n.\n.\n..\n..\n.. ⎥\nD = ⎢. . .\n(2.44)\n⎥.\n⎢\n⎥\n⎣1 0 ξ m 0 ηm 0 ⎦\n0 1 0 ξ m 0 ηm\n\nThe unknown coefficients a can be estimated by solving, in the least squares\nsense,\nmin{||ũ − Da||},\n(2.45)\na\n\nwhere the objective function\n\n||ũ − Da|| = (ũ − Da)! (ũ − Da) ,\n\n(2.46)\n\nrepresents the Euclidean distance between the vectors ũ and ũc . The minimization problem stated in Eq.(2.45) is equivalent to the linear system\n\nwhose solution, gives\n\nD! Da = D! ũ,\n\n(2.47)\n\na = (D! D)−1 D! ũ.\n\n(2.48)\n\nSubstituting Eq.(2.48) in Eq.(2.43) it is possible to obtain an approximation of\nthe nodal values of the compatible displacements in terms of the nodal values\nof the virtual displacements\nũc = Πs ũ,\n(2.49)\n\n24\n\nThe Virtual Element Method\n\nwhere Πs ∈ R2m×2m is the matrix projector operator\nΠs = D (D! D)−1 D! .\n\n(2.50)\n\nTo reintroduce the amount of the deformation energy neglected by the\nconsistency term, the energy associated to the displacement difference ũ − ũc\nis taken in account by defining the following expression of the stabilization\nterm\ns E (uh , vh ) = [ṽ − ũc ]! μ [ũ − ũc ]\n\n= [ṽ − Πs ṽ]! μ [ũ − Πs ũ]\n= [(I − Πs ) ṽ]! μ [(I − Πs ) ũ]\n= ṽ! (I − Πs )! μ (I − Πs ) ũ\n= ṽ! KsE ũ,\n\n(2.51)\n\nwhere I ∈ R2m×2m is the identity matrix, and\nKsE = (I − Πs )! μ (I − Πs ) ,\n\n(2.52)\n\nis the virtual element stabilization matrix KsE ∈ R2m×2m . The constant parameter μ is used to ensure the correct scaling of the stability term with respect\nto the element size and material constants. For linear elasticity problems, following Ref.[34], this parameter can be expressed as\nμ = τ tr (KcE ) ,\n\n(2.53)\n\nwhere tr (KcE ) is the trace of the consistency matrix KcE and the factor τ > 0\ncan be selected as τ = 1 or τ = 0.5 [13]. However, other choices can be found\nin the literature [77].\nEventually, the stiffness matrix KE for a generic virtual element E can be\ncomputed as the sum of the consistency and stability matrices\nKE = KcE + KsE .\n\n(2.54)\n\nIt is also worth noting that if the generic virtual element is a triangle, the\napproximated constant strain field computed trough the projector operator\nmatrix is compatible with the boundary piece-wise linear approximation of\nthe displacement field, the difference between the displacement vectors ũc\nand ũ is null and so is the virtual element stabilization matrix KsE .\n\n2.3 VEM formulation\n\n2.3.5\n\n25\n\nLoading vectors\n\nFor the lowest-order VEM, following Ref.[31] the local contribution GE (·) to\nthe virtual work of the volume load f appearing at the right-hand side of\nEq.(2.17), if existing, can be approximated as\nh\n\nGE (v ) ≈ GEh (vh ) =\nwhere\nv̄h =\n\n*\n\nv̄h · f h dE,\n\n(2.55)\n\n1 m h\n1 m\nv\n(\nx̃\n)\n=\ni\n∑ N(x̃i )ṽ,\nm i∑\nm\n=1\ni =1\n\n(2.56)\n\nE\n\ndenotes the average value of vh at the vertices of E and\n1\nf = Π0 ( f ) : =\n| E|\nh\n\n*\n\nE\n\nf dE,\n\n(2.57)\n\nis the L2 ( E) projection onto constants of the load f .\nThe virtual work of distributed tractions t̄, acting along a part of the element boundary denoted with ∂Et of the generic virtual element E can be\nexpressed as\nh\n\nTE (v ) =\n\n*\n\n∂Et\n\nm *\n\nv · t̄ ds = ∑\nh\n\ni =1 ei ∈∂Et\n\nvh · t̄ ds.\n\n(2.58)\n\nAnalogously to standard FEM, the knowledge of the explicit expression of the\nrestrictions of the shape functions Ni to the element edges allows the computation of the virtual work of tractions and the convenient definition of nodal\nforces f t in terms of nodal values of tractions.\nEventually, it is worth noting that, since the shape functions Ni are explicitly known on the element edges, non-homogeneous boundary conditions\nover the virtual elements can be enforced exactly as in standard FEM.\n\n2.3.6\n\nAssembly of global system\n\nDenoting with f ̃E the nodal forces, which in general include volume end\nedge contributions, and considering the definition of stiffness matrix given\nin Eq.(2.54), it is possible to write the elemental equilibrium equations of elasticity within the framework of the lowest-order VEM as\nKE ũ = f ̃E .\n\n(2.59)\n\n26\n\nThe Virtual Element Method\n\nOnce the elemental stiffness matrices and load vectors are computed, they\nare assembled into global stiffness matrix K and load vector F by employing\nstandard FE numbering and procedures, which motivates the appeal of VEM\nas a versatile method requiring minimum re-coding in existing software packages. Eventually, a system of equation for the overall discrete domain can be\nwritten as\nKU = F,\n(2.60)\nwhere U is the global vector of degrees of freedom. After prescribing appropriate boundary conditions, Eq.(2.60) can be solved using common finite\nelement solution methods.\n\n2.3.7\n\nStrains and Stresses\n\nOnce the global system in Eq.(2.60) is solved and the values of the displacement components at every node of the mesh are known, strains can be computed element-wise using the projector operator matrix Π and the vector of\nthe local nodal values of the displacement components ũ\nεΠ = Π ũ,\n\n(2.61)\n\nwhere superscript Π is used to remark that, since the displacement field is virtual in the interior of the element, the actual local strain field is approximated\nby its projection on the constant polynomial space.\nUsing Eq.(2.61), stresses can be computed element-wise using the constitutive law in Eq.(2.8)\nσ = C εΠ .\n(2.62)\nAs previously highlighted, in the lowest-order VEM formulation, the deformation field inside the generic element, obtained through the projector’s matrix expression, is a constant approximation of the actual strain field. Instead,\nthe displacement field is assumed linear on the edges of the element while inside the element it is represented by functions whose Laplacian is zero. Therefore, for a virtual element with three sides, the lowest-order VEM formulation\ncoincides with the standard FEM formulation of the linear triangular element,\ncommonly known as CST (Constant Strain Triangle). In the case of polygonal virtual elements with more than three sides, the degrees of freedom that\nuniquely define the displacement field could give rise to a deformation field\nof higher order than the constant one. In this case, some loss of information might be expected when using Eq.(2.62) for calculating the stress field,\n\n2.4 VESTA - A Virtual Element toolbox\n\n27\n\nespecially in the case of polygonal elements with many sides. Although in\nliterature there are studies of convergence of the VEM which show that this\nintrinsic loss of information of the method is negligible [132], it is worth noting that it is possible to extend to VEM [15] some stress-recovery techniques\nalready widely used in FEM [4].\n\n2.4\n\nVESTA - A Virtual Element toolbox\n\nThe purpose of this Section is to introduce VESTA, the virtual element program\nthat has been developed and used to perform all the analysis of the present\nthesis. VESTA is an acronym for Virtual Element for STructural Analysis, and\nit is a framework for the implementation of the Virtual Element Method for\nthe solution of two-dimensional elasticity problems in plane strain or plane\nstress. MATLAB is the scripting language that has been chosen to write all the\nfunctions that are part of the current VESTA software library. The program is\nwritten using a proper mix of Object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming, using the former for core functions and organising and\nmanaging data structures and functional features where this makes coding\nmore concise and flexible.\nVESTA is essentially a finite element program and, in this respect, its structure is similar to other research-oriented finite element codes. The program\nfeatures a ”core and applications” approach where a set of core tools are available as building blocks in developing new applications that focus on the solution of particular problems of interest.\nThe program includes an integrated set of functions used to perform the following tasks:\n• Generate, visualize and store the input data describing a finite element\nmodel;\n• Solve a specific application trough appropriate solution algorithms;\n• Return graphical and numerical output of analysis results and save them\nto file.\nThe program’s main block includes a MATLAB class object that contains all\nthe input of data describing the structural analysis model for the specific analysis. It stores all the relevant data on the analysis type, mesh structure, material properties, applied loads and boundary conditions. This function allows\n\n28\n\nThe Virtual Element Method\n\nto save the analysis information to a text input file or to load a previously\nsaved analysis model.\nThe current version of VESTA contains an element library with different\ntypes of elements. Each element type has a specific MATLAB class object that\ncontains all the functions needed for computation of element matrices, element force vectors and output strains and stresses associated with each element. A separate function is used to project these quantities to nodes allowing graphical outputs of results. The main element type used by the program\nis the general polygonal VEM element with the first-order formulation. For\naccuracy comparison and testing purposes, the element library has been expanded to include first-order (linear) interpolation triangular standard finite\nelements and fully integrated, two-dimensional, linear and quadratic interpolation quadrilateral elements. Another relevant class object of this group\nis dedicated to the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The BEM class object\ncontains all the functions to perform a stand-alone boundary element analysis with linear interpolation elements in the framework of linear elasticity. It\nalso contains the functions needed to construct the equivalent stiffness matrix\nand the nodal force vectors for a BEM super-element. As shown later in this\nthesis, these functions are used to interface a BEM subdomain with another\nsubdomain discretised with VEM elements.\nA separate assembly function performs the task of assembling the global\nstiffness matrix and the global force vector. This function accesses a material\nmodel library used to compute the constitutive equations. The current implemented material models are linear elastic material and isotropic damage\nmodel material.\nMesh generation and manipulation are performed using both third-part\nand in-house developed codes. For the generation of a triangular mesh, two\ndifferent third part codes are used. For relatively simple domains whose geometries can be specified by signed distance functions VESTA relies on DistMesh\n[145], a MATLAB code for generation of unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes that uses the Delaunay triangulation routine in MATLAB and optimizes the node locations by a force-based smoothing procedure. To generate\ntriangular meshes on domains with more complex geometries, the software\nused is MESH2D [70], a MATLAB-based Delaunay mesh-generator designed to\ngenerate high-quality constrained Delaunay triangulations for general polygonal regions in the plane. MESH2D provides an effective implementations of\n”Delaunay-refinement” and ”Frontal-Delaunay” triangulation techniques, in\nadditional to ”hill-climbing” type mesh-optimisation. It also provides sup-\n\n2.5 VEM implementation aspects\n\n29\n\nport for user-defined ”mesh-spacing” functions and ”multi-part” geometry\ndefinitions, allowing varying levels of mesh-resolution to be specified within\ncomplex domains.\nTo exploit the capabilities of the Virtual Element Method, a polygonal\nmesh generator is required. For simple analysis on geometric domain without internal partitions, VESTA relies on Polymesher [168], a simple and robust\nMATLAB code for polygonal mesh generation that relies on an implicit description of the domain geometry. An example of a polygonal mesh generated\nwith Polymesher is shown in Fig.(2.2). To perform more complex polygonal\nmesh generation tasks, like the ones involved in the automatic discretisation\nof random generated composite microstructures, where the analysis domain\nconsists of multiple subdomains, an in-house mesh generation code has been\nimplemented. It is based on an initial conforming triangular discretisation of\nthe domain and a subsequent generation of a bounded Voronoi tessellation\ngenerated using the centroids of the triangular mesh elements as seed points.\nMore details and examples about this process will be given in the following\nChapters.\n\n2.5\n\nVEM implementation aspects\n\nAs highlighted before, there are a few similarities between VEM and standard\nFEM that allow the use of virtual elements within existing software packages\nwith minimum re-coding. The purpose of this Section is to summarize the\nmain similarities and differences between the two methods concerning mesh\ngeneration and management, global system assembly procedure and related\ncomputational cost.\nRegarding the management of the discretization input, it is evident that\nthe main difference between the standard FEM and the VEM lies in the arbitrariness of the mesh elements’ geometry. While in the standard FEM, in\nthe two-dimensional case, the elements allowed are exclusively triangles or\nquadrilaterals, in the VEM generic polygonal elements are allowed. The arbitrary number of sides that the VEM admits for a generic element of the mesh\nrequires appropriate input management. The latter consideration implies that\nthe data structure used to store information on the mesh topology in a FEM\ncode may not be directly applicable to a VEM-based code. A proposed way\nof approaching this issue [132] is to set a separate data structure for the VEM\ndiscretization that uses an associative array (map) where the key is the number of polygon nodes, and the value is the corresponding connectivity array\n\n30\n\nThe Virtual Element Method\n\n(element freedom table). The approach followed in VESTA relies instead on\nconsidering all the mesh entries in the connectivity table as polygonal elements and associate with each element of the table an ”element type” key to\nsort FEM elements from VEM elements. This approach is particularly useful\nwhen, as will be seen later in this thesis, the computation domain discretization includes BEM super-elements, i.e. polygonal elements discretised on the\nboundary with multiple BEM elements but considered, for the analysis, as\nsingle elements.\nAs already mentioned, the computational cost for generating the global\nsystem of equation for VEM’s lowest-order formulation is comparable to FEM’s\nfor linear triangular elements. The main difference between the two formulations resides in the additional computation of the stabilization term of a VEM\nelement stiffness matrix which requires the computation of a matrix inversion\nonce per element.\nOnce an efficient scheme for polygonal mesh management has been setup, VEM’s assembling of the global system of equation proceeds in a similar\nfashion to standard FEM’s one, actually, the same functions that would be\nused for a FEM program can be employed with minor modification for a VEM\ncode when first- or second-order formulation are employed.\n\n2.6\n\nLinear patch test\n\nThis Section presents a numerical example used to assess the ability of the\nlowest-order VEM formulation to pass a polygonal element version [13] of\nthe two-dimensional plane stress linear patch test [26]. The tests have been\nperformed using the in-house developed VESTA program.\nThe analysis domain is a square whose side has length L = 1. The material properties are Young’s modulus E = 70000 and Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.3.\nGeometry and boundary conditions are shown in Fig.(2.4). Two cases are considered: in case (a) a normal traction q = 1000 applied on the right edge of\nthe square domain induces a constant normal stress; in case (b) a tangential\ntraction t = −400 applied on the all the edge of the square domain induces a\nconstant shear stress state. Both cases are analysed under plane stress using\ntwo different polygonal discretisation: mesh (1) shown in Fig.(2.5) and mesh\n(2) shown in Fig.(2.6). Node coordinates of both meshes are reported in Table (2.1).\n\n2.6 Linear patch test\n\n31\n\nThe exact solution for case (a) is\nu=\n\nq\nx,\nE\n\nv=−\n\nνq\ny,\nE\n\nσxx = q,\n\nσyy = τxy = 0.\n\n(2.63)\n\nσxx σyy = 0,\n\nτxy = t,\n\n(2.64)\n\nThe exact solution for case (b) is\nu = 0,\n\nv=\n\nt\nx,\nG\n\nwhere G is the shear modulus.\nThe error estimator for the displacement field is defined as\neu =\n\n8\n\n∑iN ||uih − ui ||2\n∑iN ||ui ||2\n\n9 12\n\n,\n\n(2.65)\n\nwhere i refers to the index of the i-th node and N is the total number of mesh\nnodes.\nThe error estimator for the stress field is defined as\n8\n\n/\n\n∑ E E ||σ (uh ) − σ (u)||2 dE\n/\neσ =\n∑ E E ||σ (u)||2 dE\n\n9 12\n\n,\n\n(2.66)\n\nwhere E denotes a generic virtual element of the mesh.\nResults, reported in Tables (2.2)) and (2.3) shows that the lowest order VEM\nformulation is capable to recover the exact solution up to machine precision.\n\n32\n\nThe Virtual Element Method\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.4: Linear patch test: geometry and boundary conditions for (a) normal and (b) shear constant stress states.\n\n3\n\n4\n\n7\n6\n8\n5\n\n2\n\n1\nFigure 2.5: Linear patch test: mesh (1).\n\n2.6 Linear patch test\n\n33\n\n3\n\n4\n\n7\n11\n\n10\n\n12\n\n9\n\n8\n\n6\n\n5\n\n2\n\n1\nFigure 2.6: Linear patch test: mesh (2).\n\nNode\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\nx\n0.000\n1.000\n1.000\n0.000\n0.562\n0.728\n0.438\n0.272\n0.562\n0.535\n0.438\n0.465\n\ny\n0.000\n0.000\n1.000\n1.000\n0.272\n0.562\n0.728\n0.438\n0.465\n0.562\n0.535\n0.438\n\nTable 2.1: Linear patch test.

Such flexibility makes the VEM\nan ideal candidate tool for computational homogenization studies, where the\nstructure-property link is investigated homogenising the micro-fields over\nseveral statistical realisations of the material microstructure. In other words,\nbeing computational homogenization based on the analysis carried out over\nmany micro representative volume elements, often generated and meshed automatically, the possibility to relieve the need of carefully assessing the quality\nof each mesh makes the VEM a suitable method for such analysis.\nThe present Chapter is intended to present the Virtual Element Method’s\napplication to the computational homogenization of polycrystalline and fibrereinforced materials. The study has been conducted using the lowest-order\nVEM formulation presented in Chapter (2) for linear two-dimensional elastic problems. Emphasis is given to the method’s flexibility in the analysis of\nrandomly generated and meshed microstructures.\nThis Chapter is organised as follows. Section 3.2 details the computational\n35\n\n36\n\nComputational homogenization of composite and heterogeneous\nmaterials\n\naspects implemented to deal with generic polycrystalline and fibre-reinforced\nmicro-morphologies and their meshing, describing the suitability of the virtual element method in dealing with specific features. Section 3.3 illustrates\nthe application of the method to the computational homogenization of the\nconsidered materials and concludes the study.\n\n3.2\n\nMulti-domain implementation\n\nIn this Section, the multi-region implementation for computational material\nhomogenization is described with reference to two classes of materials: polycrystalline and unidirectional fibre-reinforced composites, widely employed\nin engineering applications.\nSome VEM applications to material homogenization of composites [12,\n16, 148] and polycrystalline materials [124] have very recently appeared in\nthe literature. Refs.[12, 16] consider unit cells with a single circular or elliptical inclusion, considered as the basic building block of composite materials\nwith regular fibres distributions. Ref.[148] considers domains with a statistical distribution of fibres, but a single polygonal VEM element is used to model\nthe individual fibres. Ref.[124] uses single polygonal or polyhedral VEM elements to model individual crystals in 2D and 3D, for homogenization purposes. In the present study, the focus is slightly different. Multi-domain microstructures obtained from random processes are considered, and no a priori\nassumption is made about the number of VEM elements used to model individual fibres or crystals. Emphasis is given to the flexibility offered by the\nfeatures of VEM in meshing such general morphologies, which make it a convenient method for the analysis of complex random material microstructures.\nThe first step toward materials computational micro-mechanics is the adoption of an accurate representation of the material microstructure. This can be\nbased either on the experimental reconstruction of real microstructures or on\nthe computer generation of artificial models embodying the microstructural\naggregate’s relevant statistical features. Experimental techniques provide essential information, but they require suitable and generally expensive equipment and complicated and time-consuming post-processing. On the other\nhand, the use of reliable computer models offers the opportunity of simulating large numbers of microstructures, helping reduce the cost of the experimental effort [186].\nIn the context of the analysis of heterogeneous materials, the concepts of\nRepresentative Volume Element (RVE ) and Statistical Volume Element (SVE)\n\n3.2 Multi-domain implementation\n\n37\n\nare notions of primary importance, see, e.g. Refs.[89, 87, 142, 81]. If a single microstructural realization is considered, it is crucial to determine the unit\ncell’s minimum size needed to attain material representativity. The term realization is herein used to denote the specific morphology associated with a set\nof randomly scattered seed points, which can identify the centroids of polycrystals generated through Voronoi tessellations or the position of the fibres in\nfibre-reinforced composites; in this sense, the specific morphology has a role\nanalogous to the value assumed by a random variable. For polycrystalline\nmaterials, the size of the RVE can be expressed in terms of the number of\ngrains Ng contained in the artificial microstructure. For unidirectional (UD)\nfibre-reinforced composites, the size of the RVE is measured by the parameter\nδ, defined as the ratio between the length L of the side of a square unit cell\nand the radius r of the inclusion, typically a fibre, i.e.\nδ=\n\nL\n.\nr\n\n(3.1)\n\nA definition of RVE can also be provided considering not only volume averages over individual realizations of different sizes but also ensemble averages\nover a set of realizations of the same size, provided that a sufficient number of\nsamples is considered [102], which suggests the concept of SVE. With this approach, the estimation of the effective properties is obtained by computing the\nensemble average of the apparent properties over a collection of realizations\nhaving the same size.\nIn the subsequent sections, the multi-region VEM strategy adopted for\ncomputational homogenization of heterogeneous materials is described, highlighting the VEM features that result particularly convenient for the meshing of irregular geometries, namely the VEM ability of naturally dealing with\nhanging nodes and non-convex or heavily distorted mesh elements. The method\nhas been implemented for both polycrystalline and unidirectional (UD) fibrereinforced composite materials, treated separately in the following sections to\nhighlight the specific modelling requirements and the adopted solutions.\n\n3.2.1\n\nPolycrystalline materials\n\nThe modelling strategy employed for the analysis of polycrystalline materials at the micro-scale is described in this section, starting from the method\nadopted to construct the artificial microstructure.\n\n38\n\nComputational homogenization of composite and heterogeneous\nmaterials\n\nGeneration of artificial polycrystalline micro-morphologies\nA reliable computer representation of the polycrystalline microstructure must\nretain the main topological, morphological and crystallographic features of\nthe aggregate such as the number of vertices, edges and faces per grain, grain\nsize distribution, grain shape and crystallographic orientation. Voronoi tessellations, which are analytically well defined and relatively simple to generate,\nhave been successfully used to reproduce the main statistical features of real\npolycrystalline morphologies [23, 72, 150, 45], see Fig.(3.1).\n\nFigure 3.1: Example of a two-dimensional Voronoi tessellation on a square\ndomain.\nGiven a bounded domain Ω ∈ R2 , its Voronoi tessellation is constructed\nstarting from a set of n seed points S = { xi ∈ Ω : i ∈ In }, with In =\n{1, 2, ..., n}. A Voronoi cell Gi having the seed xi as its generator is defined\nas the set of points which are closer to xi than to any other seed point, i.e.\n\nGi = {x : ∥x − xi ∥ < ∥x − x j ∥ ∀ j ̸= i, j ∈ In }.\n\n(3.2)\n\nEach seed is the generator of its Voronoi cell, and all cells form a Voronoi\n\n3.2 Multi-domain implementation\n\n39\n\ndiagram, which divides the two-dimensional space into the union of convex,\nnon-overlapping polygons with straight edges.\nThe tessellation’s topology and morphology depend on the distribution of\nthe seeds within the domain Ω. It has been shown that a Voronoi tessellation,\nbuilt on a set of randomly distributed seeds, referred to as Poisson-Voronoi\ntessellation, possesses statistical features that make it topologically close to\nreal polycrystalline aggregates [106]. However, randomly distributed seed\npoints tend to generate Voronoi tessellations with a high number of highly irregular or excessively distorted grains, particularly challenging from the point\nof view of mesh preparation for subsequent numerical analysis. Various techniques have been used to produce tessellations with non-pathological grain\nshapes or edges, e.g. enforcing a hardcore condition on the initial distribution\nof seed points or by employing more sophisticated regularization procedures,\naddressed at avoiding an excessively refined mesh induced by the presence\nof small edges in the mathematically exact built tessellation [83, 150].\nIn the present study, two-dimensional Voronoi tessellations are employed\nto generate artificial polycrystalline microstructures, where each Voronoi cell\nrepresents an individual grain. To demonstrate the ability of the Virtual Element Method to deal with mesh elements of very general polygonal shape,\nalso generated over irregular geometries, no regularization scheme is adopted,\nand instead, a pure Poisson-Voronoi tessellation, with uniform random grain\ndistribution and size, is used.\nThe tessellations have been generated using the Qhull [24] algorithm included in MATLAB to generate a uniform distribution inside the square domain\nrepresenting the boundary of the unit cell. Since the edge length of the square\ndomain is fixed, the only input required is the number of seed points equal to\nthe number of grains. Fig.(3.2) shows different microstructural morphologies\ncorresponding to different numbers of grains Ng .\n\nMicro-mechanical polycrystalline modelling\nA linear elastic orthotropic model is used to describe the mechanical behaviour\nof individual crystals. The orthotropic material hypothesis is not restrictive\nsince most single-crystal metallic and ceramic materials present a general orthotropic behaviour. For an orthotropic material in a three-dimensional framework, the linear elastic constitutive laws introduced in Eq.(2.2) may be written\n\n40\n\nComputational homogenization of composite and heterogeneous\nmaterials\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 3.2: Polycrystalline morphologies with different numbers of grains: a)\nNg = 10; b) Ng = 50; c) Ng = 100; d) Ng = 200.\nas\n\n⎡\n\n⎤ ⎡\n⎤⎡ ⎤\nσ11\nC11 C12 C13 0\n0\n0\nε 11\n⎢σ22 ⎥ ⎢C12 C22 C23 0\n⎢ ⎥\n0\n0 ⎥\n⎢ ⎥ ⎢\n⎥ ⎢ ε 22 ⎥\n⎢σ33 ⎥ ⎢C13 C23 C33 0\n⎢ ⎥\n0\n0 ⎥\n⎢ ⎥=⎢\n⎥ ⎢ ε 33 ⎥ ,\n⎢σ23 ⎥ ⎢ 0\n⎥\n⎥\n0\n0 C44 0\n0 ⎥⎢\n⎢ ⎥ ⎢\n⎢γ23 ⎥\n⎣σ13 ⎦ ⎣ 0\n0\n0\n0 C55 0 ⎦ ⎣γ13 ⎦\nσ12\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 C66\nγ12\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere γij = 2ε ij for i = 1, ...3 and i ̸= j.\nEach grain of the microstructure is assumed to have random spatial orientation of the principal material directions {1, 2, 3}. Although two-dimensional\nproblems are considered in the present study, the possibility of investigating\nthe effect of the randomness of each grain’s spatial orientation on the overall behaviour of the microstructure is preserved, as explained next. Following\n[72], each generated grain has, randomly, one of three principal material directions that coincides with the z-axis (normal to the analysis plane). Moreover,\nfor each grain, the angle θ ∈ [0, 2π ) between the global axes x and y and the\naxes of the two principal material directions lying in the plane x − y is also\nrandomly generated, Fig.(3.3).\nThe artificial polycrystalline morphology generated according to the procedure explained in Section 3.2.1 can be considered a multi-domain problem, in which different elastic properties and orientations are assigned to\neach grain. In the context of the FEM, several strategies have been used, in\nthe literature, for the automatic generation of meshes for polycrystalline microstructures, and both structured and unstructured meshes have been used\n[150, 80, 74].\nStructured meshes are generally unable to resolve the grain boundaries,\n\n3.2 Multi-domain implementation\n\n41\n\nFigure 3.3: Example distribution of the principal material directions within\neach grain. The three different colours specify which principal direction coincides with the global z-axis. The orientations in the x − y plane of the other\ntwo principal material directions is represented by two black vectors.\nwhile unstructured meshes overcome this issue. However, given the morphological properties of random Voronoi tessellations, the generation of high\nquality conforming meshes requires a high degree of refinement that significantly increases the number of degrees of freedom.\nIn the present study, a multi-domain conforming meshing strategy is adopted,\nwhich takes advantage of the particular capability of the VEM of dealing with\npolygonal mesh elements with an arbitrary number of edges as well as with\nhanging nodes. Each grain of the microstructure has been independently\nmeshed using a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT; not to be confused with\nthe tessellation used to generate the morphology), which allows subdividing\nthe often very irregular grain geometry into quite regular polygonal elements,\nsee Fig.(3.4). For this purpose, a modified version of Polymesher [168] is used;\nPolymesher is a mesh generator for polygonal elements written in MATLAB.\nThe number of elements per grain is given as input, defined as the ratio between the grain area and the requested global mesh size.\nOnce all the grains have been independently meshed, in general, at the grain\nboundaries, there will be sets of collinear nodes belonging to different grains,\nwhich would induce a non-conformal mesh of the microstructure. However,\nsince the VEM can deal with general polygonal elements, also presenting\nconsecutive aligned edges, the creation of conformal meshes is conceptually\nstraightforward, and it can be attained by just adding nodes on edges shared\n\n42\n\nComputational homogenization of composite and heterogeneous\nmaterials\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 3.4: Polygonal meshes of different polycrystalline aggregates with increasing numbers of grains: a) Ng = 10; b) Ng = 50; c) Ng = 100; d) Ng = 200.\n\nbetween different grains. Fig.(3.5) shows the creation of conforming meshes\nbetween adjacent grains: the presence of nodes initially hanging between contiguous grains is dealt with by transforming such nodes into vertices shared\nbetween the contiguous elements belonging to two adjacent grains. For the\ngeneric boundary polygonal element, such vertices are located between consecutive aligned edges, which are naturally dealt with by the VEM. In other\nwords, the nodes that would be hanging in standard FEM implementations,\nare here treated as regular nodes, leveraging on the ability of the VEM of dealing with polygonal elements with an arbitrary number of edges and also with\ncollinear consecutive edges.\nPolycrystalline microstructures generated using the described strategies\nhave been used to perform the computational material homogenization reported in Section (3.3).\n\n3.2.2\n\nUnidirectional fibre-reinforced composite materials\n\nThe modelling methodology adopted for the homogenization of composite\nfibre-reinforced materials is described in this Section. In general, reinforcing\nfibres may be randomly distributed within the matrix, which can induce irregular and complex meshes. The VEM’s versatility in dealing with general\npolygonal elements, including non-convex or distorted elements, allows noticeable simplification of the pre-processing effort.\n\n3.2 Multi-domain implementation\n\n43\n\nFigure 3.5: Creation of conforming meshes between adjacent grains: the nodes\ninitially hanging between contiguous grains are transformed into vertices\nshared between the contiguous elements belonging to two adjacent grains.\nGeneration of artificial composite micro-morphologies\nSeveral algorithms have been proposed in the literature to generate microstructures of UD fibre-reinforced composite materials, see, e.g. [128, 59, 144] and\nreferences therein. In the present study, artificial periodic microstructures of\nfibre-reinforced composites are generated as square unit cells with random\ncircular disk-shaped inclusions representing the fibres’ transversal sections.\nAn individual morphology is generated starting from two input parameters:\nthe target volume fraction Vf and the size parameter δ, see Eq.(3.1). The number of fibre inclusions N f in the unit cell is given by\nNf =\n\nVf δ 2\n.\nπ\n\n(3.4)\n\nA non-overlapping condition is enforced by setting a minimum allowed distance d between the centres of the circular disk-shaped inclusions, with d >\n2r, where r is given by Eq.(3.1). In order to generate a valid periodic microstructure with random fibre distribution, the following iterative procedure\nis adopted:\n1. A random uniform set of N f seed points is initially scattered within the\nsquared bounding box representing the boundary of the unit cell;\n\n44\n\nComputational homogenization of composite and heterogeneous\nmaterials\n\n2. To attain microstructural periodicity, the set of seed points is replicated\nwithin eight copies of the original box created around the original unit\ncell; each one of the surrounding boxes has the same size as that of the\noriginal one so that a total of 9N f points are created overall (the process\nis similar to the one adopted, e.g. in Ref.[41]);\n3. A Delaunay triangulation of the extended domain is generated starting\nfrom the 9N f points;\n4. For each edge of the triangulation, the distance between the end vertices\nis computed; if such length is ≤ 2r, the vertices are moved apart along\nthe direction identified by the edge itself of distance proportional to the\noriginal edge length;\n5. The new coordinates of the original N f points are extracted. If in step\n3, any point has been translated, the set of N f points with the new coordinates is sent to step 2 for a new iteration; otherwise, the process is\nterminated.\nOnce a set of points respecting the non-overlapping condition is obtained,\na disk-shaped inclusion can be associated to each seed; the desired periodic\nmicrostructure is then extracted by trimming the original bounding box, with\ncircular inclusions, out of the extended domain. Some realizations obtained\nfor different values of δ and Vf = 0.29 are shown in Fig.(3.6).\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 3.6: Different realizations of fibre-reinforced composite unit cells for\nVf = 0.29 and different values of the parameter δ = L/r: a) δ = 10; b) δ = 20;\nc) δ = 35; d) δ = 50.\n\n3.2 Multi-domain implementation\n\n45\n\nMicro-mechanical composites modelling\nUnidirectional fibre-reinforced composites can be macroscopically considered\ntransversely isotropic materials, whose properties emerge from the features\nand interplay of their constituents, i.e. from the properties of fibres, matrix,\nfibre-matrix interface and the ratio Vf between the volume of fibres and the\ntotal volume of the composite.\nFor representing the composite microstructure, a multi-domain meshing\nstrategy is adopted that is slightly different from the one used for the polycrystalline microstructure. Still, the ability of VEM to handle elements of very\ngeneral shape is exploited. The adopted meshing strategy is based on the\nthree following steps:\n1. A conforming triangular mesh of the considered artificial micro-morphology\nis generated using the software DistMesh [145];\n2. A polygonal mesh is built from the bounded Voronoi diagram generated\nusing the centroids of the triangular mesh elements as seed points;\n3. The polygonal element of the mesh obtained which intersect the fibre\ninclusions boundaries are trimmed so to conform to such boundaries.\nThe above process allows the generation of a regular polygonal discretization over the whole computational domain except for the areas close to the\nfibre boundaries, where the ability of VEM to handle elements of arbitrary\nshapes, including non-convex shapes, is exploited. Fig.(3.7) shows an example of polygonal mesh generated for a composite unit cell sample, and the\ndetail in the inset on the right shows how irregular polygonal elements may\nappear in proximity of the inclusions boundaries; the capability of the VEM to\naddress irregular, distorted or non-convex elements allows to retain meshes\nthat would require regularization or further treatment otherwise.\nIndeed, the use of VEM may also simplify the implementation of straightforward regularization schemes. An example is provided in Fig.(3.8): the\nmeshing of a fibre-reinforced composite through the operations summarised\nabove may induce the presence of polygonal elements of size comparatively\ntoo small with respect to the average mesh size, represented as the blue elements in Fig.(3.8a); in this case, it may be useful to absorb such small entities\nwithin contiguous elements, the red ones in Fig.(3.8a-3.8b). While such ”absorption” operation would require nodes/edges shifting in standard FEM, it\ncan be performed using VEM by just retaining the external polygonal edges of\n\n46\n\nComputational homogenization of composite and heterogeneous\nmaterials\n\nFigure 3.7: Generation of a polygonal mesh for a composite unit cell morphology with Vf = 0.44 and δ = 40 (left).\nthe absorbing/absorbed element couples, as shown in Fig.(3.8b). This simple\nstrategy, discussed here as an example of the VEM’s flexibility in dealing with\nmeshing, noticeably reduces the number of small elements in general composite unit cells, also reducing the possibility of artefacts in the local fields.\nHowever, the subsequent computational analysis cost is generally little affected unless very large numbers of such small elements are present.\n\n3.3\n\nComputational homogenization tests\n\nThis section describes the numerical tests performed to validate the developed homogenization procedure and the Virtual Element Method’s reliability\nwith respect to such application. The numerical tests’ purpose is to estimate\nthe effective transverse elastic properties of polycrystalline and unidirectional\nfibre-reinforced composite materials. The obtained numerical results are compared with available analytical bounds.\nFor each microstructural sample, assuming plane strain conditions, the apparent transverse elastic properties are calculated from the solution of three\ndifferent boundary value problems, differing only in the prescribed set of\nboundary conditions. Kinematic uniform boundary conditions, i.e. linear displacements boundary conditions, are enforced at all external nodes of the con-\n\n3.3 Computational homogenization tests\n\n47\n\nsidered microstructure. Such enforced boundary displacements correspond to\na macro-strain Γ̄. More specifically, if a reference system x − y with the axes\naligned with the external edges of the unit cell is adopted, the three different\nsets of displacement boundary conditions correspond to: a) a uniaxial direct\nmacro-strain along the x direction; b) a uniaxial direct macro-strain along the y\ndirection; c) a pure shear macro-strain acting to modify the angle between the\naxes xy. The enforced displacement micro-BCs are related to the macroscopic\nstrain by the relation\nūi = Γ̄ij x j ∀x ∈ ∂Ω.\n(3.5)\nThe relation between macro-stress and macro-strain is given by:\nΣij = Ĉijkl Γ̄kl ,\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere Ĉ is the apparent macroscopic fourth-order elastic tensor, while Σij\nare the components of the macroscopic stress tensor, which can be computed\nupon the solution of the micro boundary value problem by the volume average of the local micro stress tensor over the domain of the RVE, i.e.\n1\nΣij =\n|Ω|\n\n*\n\nΩ\n\nσij (x)dΩ.\n\n(3.7)\n\nIn Voigt notation, the apparent macroscopic elastic tensor Ĉ is expressed through\nthe apparent stiffness matrix Ĉ whose components can be determined columnwise from the solution of the three linearly independent boundary value problems mentioned above. Once an estimate of the apparent stiffness matrix is\navailable, the apparent elastic modula can be readily estimated.\n\n3.3.1\n\nComputational homogenization of FCC polycrystals\n\nThe determination of the macroscopic properties of materials presenting microscopic cubic symmetry has been previously addressed in the literature,\nsee, e.g. Ref.[46]. Numerical simulations are performed in order to estimate\nthe effective transverse elastic properties, namely the macroscopic isotropic\nYoung’s modulus Ê and shear modulus Ĝ, for three different polycrystalline\nmaterials presenting cubic symmetry at crystal level: copper, gold and nickel.\nIn the case of materials with cubic symmetry, such as FCC (Face Centred\nCubic) metals, the specification about the grains’ orientation, as mentioned\nin Section 3.2.1, is unnecessary, and the three principal axes are equivalent.\n\n48\n\nComputational homogenization of composite and heterogeneous\nmaterials\n\nGrains with cubic symmetry present only three distinct elastic constants C11 ,\nC12 and C44 and the reduced stiffness matrix for plain strain C reads\n⎡\n\n⎤\nC11 C12 0\nC = ⎣C12 C11 0 ⎦ .\n0\n0 C44\n\n(3.8)\n\nThe elastic constants for the three selected materials are summarized in Table (3.1), as taken from Ref.[46].\nFor each material, aggregates with Ng = 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 grains have\nbeen tested. For given material and number of grains, 50 different realisations\nhave been generated and analysed. Each realisation differs from the others in\nterms of both geometry and grains orientation. Table (3.2) reports the minimum, the average and the maximum number of degrees of freedoms, related\nto the number of grains in the analysed polycrystalline microstructures.\nThe homogenization is performed following the procedure employed in\nRef.[46]. For a macroscopically isotropic aggregate, the range of the Young\nand shear effective moduli is bounded by a lower (Reuss) bound and an upper\n(Voigt) bound. Such limits are also referred to in the literature as first-order\nbounds. The Reuss [152] lower bound is obtained by assuming that all the\ngrains undergo uniform stress, while the Voigt [175] upper bound is obtained\nassuming that all the grains undergo uniform strain. Since a two-dimensional\nmodel is being considered, the bounds are computed by averaging the singlecrystal plain strain reduced stiffness matrix over all possible orientations of\nthe random angle θ formed between the material direction 1 and the lower\nhorizontal edge of the square unit cell, as shown, e.g. in Ref.[135].\nThe obtained numerical results, in terms of the effective Young’s modulus Ê and shear modulus Ĝ, are shown in Fig.(3.9). The Reuss and Voigt\nbounds are also shown for comparison purpose.

It is noticed how, as the number of grains per realization\nincreases, the scatter of the apparent properties reduces. When realizations\nwith Ng = 200 are considered, the apparent moduli always fall within the\nfirst-order bounds.\n\n3.3.2\n\nComputational homogenization of fibre-reinforced composites\n\nTwo of the unidirectional fibre-reinforced composite materials considered in\nRef.[159] are selected for the numerical tests on composite unit cells. The first\ncomposite, here labelled COMP1, is made of AS4 carbon fibres embedded\nin 3501 − 6 epoxy matrix. The second composite, here labelled COMP2, is\nmade of Silenka E-glass 1200 tex fibres embedded in MY750/HY917/DY063\nepoxy matrix. The fibre volume fractions considered in the performed tests\nare Vf = 0.22, Vf = 0.29, Vf = 0.36 and Vf = 0.44.\nThe axis (1) is parallel to the fibres, and it is normal to the (2-3) plane,\nin which the 2D unit cell lies. The mechanical properties of the constituents,\nthemselves isotropic in the (2-3) plane, are given in Table (3.3) in terms of\ntransverse Young’s modulus E22 and transverse shear modulus G23 .\nTable 3.3: Mechanical properties for the matrix and fibres of COMP1 and\nCOMP2, as taken from Ref.[159].\nMechanical Properties\nAS4 carbon fibres\n3501-6 epoxy matrix\nSilenka E-Glass 1200 tex fibres\nMY750/HY917/DY063 epoxy matrix\n\nE22 [GPa]\n15\n4.2\n74\n3.35\n\nG23 [GPa]\n7\n1.567\n30.8\n1.24\n\nA unidirectional fibre-reinforced composite lamina is macroscopically transversely isotropic so that only two elastic modula are needed to completely\n\n50\n\nComputational homogenization of composite and heterogeneous\nmaterials\n\ncharacterize the transverse behaviour in the plane of isotropy (2-3). In this\nstudy, the numerical tests results are given in terms of the plain strain bulk\nmodulus K23 and the shear modulus G23 .\nThe minimal RVE size for unidirectional fibre-reinforced composites similar to those considered here has been investigated in Ref.[172], where it was\nfound that, when the purpose of the analysis is the estimation of the effective\nproperties, a minimum size parameter of δ ≥ 30 is required. The effective\nproperties’ convergence is assessed in the range 10 ≤ δ ≤ 50.\nFigs.(3.10-3.11) show, for both composite materials and for each considered value of the volume fraction Vf , the average and the scatter range of the\ncomputed elastic properties as a function of the unit cell size, as expressed by\nδ. The average is computed over ensembles of 50 realizations for each value of\nδ. It can be observed that, for both considered materials and for δ ≥ 30, there\nis no appreciable variation in the values of either the average elastic modula\nor the scatter, which confirms convergence of the effective properties (please\nnote the tight scale used in the graphs).\nFigs.(3.12-3.13) show the numerical predictions about the computed transverse mechanical properties K23 and G23 versus the fibre-volume fraction Vf at\nδ = 50. The Voigt and Reuss bounds and the Hashin-Hill bounds [89, 86] for\nthe effective elastic modula are also shown for comparison purpose. The obtained numerical estimates are in agreement with the theoretical predictions.\nTable (3.4) shows the minimum, average and maximum number of degrees of freedoms, in the analysed composite microstructures, for Vf = 0.22\nand at different values of the size parameter δ.\n\n3.4\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this Chapter, a lowest-order Virtual Element framework for computational\nmaterials homogenisation has been developed, and it has been applied to both\nTable 3.4: Minimum, average and maximum number of DOFs for the analysed\ncomposite microstructures for Vf = 0.22.\n\nndo f\n\nNg\nMin\nAverage\nMax\n\n10\n1836\n1932\n1984\n\n15\n3700\n3772\n3856\n\n20\n6604\n6711\n6810\n\n25\n10328\n10349\n10470\n\n30\n14670\n14838\n15022\n\n35\n19750\n19906\n20098\n\n40\n25828\n26018\n26174\n\n45\n32438\n32651\n32868\n\n50\n39842\n40117\n40354\n\n3.4 Discussion\n\n51\n\npolycrystalline materials and unidirectional fibre-reinforced composites.\nGeneral polycrystalline Voronoi microstructures have been analysed, addressing the occurrence of hanging nodes at the interface between independently meshed contiguous grains through the ability of VEM of dealing with\nelements with aligned edges. The ability of VEM of addressing non-convex\npolygonal element, on the other hand, has been employed in the analysis of\ngeneral composite fibre-reinforced morphologies obtained from the random\nscattering of fibres with circular sections.\nThis study has shown how the VEM’s capability to deal with very general polygonal mesh elements, including non-convex and highly distorted\nelements, can be profitably exploited to relax the requirements on the mesh\nquality that may hinder the automatic analysis of micro-morphologies presenting complex or highly statistically varying features, commonly met in\ncomputational materials micro-mechanics and homogenisation, where materials microstructures are often generated resorting to stochastic algorithms.\n\n52\n\nComputational homogenization of composite and heterogeneous\nmaterials\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 3.8: A simple VEM-based regularization scheme: a) elements considerably smaller than the average mesh size may be present in the mesh of the\ncomposite fibre-reinforced unit cell (blue in the online version of the paper);\nb) the small elements can be absorbed within contiguous elements of larger\nsize (red in the online version of the manuscript); with VEM such operation\nis performed by simply creating larger polygonal elements bounded by the\nexternal edges of the absorbing/absorbed element couple. In unit cells with\nlarge numbers of fibres, e.g. the one shown in (c) with 477 fibres, δ = 50 and\nVf = 0.44, the regularization scheme noticeably reduces the presence of small\nelements, as shown by the histogram in (d).\n\n3.4 Discussion\n\n53\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f )\n\nFigure 3.9: Computed effective Young’s modulus E and shear modulus G for\npolycrystalline aggregates of copper (a-b), gold (c-d), nickel (e-f ).\n\n54\n\nComputational homogenization of composite and heterogeneous\nmaterials\n\n2.20\n\n5.48\nScatter\nMean value\n5.46\n\n2.16\nG 23 [GPa]\n\nK23 [GPa]\n\nScatter\nMean value\n\n2.18\n\n5.44\n\n2.14\n2.12\n2.10\n\n5.42\n\n2.08\n5.40\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n2.06\n\n50\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n(a)\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n(b)\n\n5.68\n\n2.48\nScatter\nMean value\n\nScatter\nMean value\n\n2.46\n2.44\n\n5.66\nG 23 [GPa]\n\nK23 [GPa]\n\n2.42\n\n5.64\n\n2.40\n2.38\n2.36\n2.34\n\n5.62\n2.32\n2.30\n2.28\n\n5.60\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n(c)\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n(d)\n\n5.90\n\n2.72\n\nScatter\nMean value\n\nScatter\nMean value\n\n2.70\n\n5.88\n\n2.68\nG 23 [GPa]\n\nK23 [GPa]\n\n2.66\n\n5.86\n\n5.84\n\n2.64\n2.62\n2.60\n2.58\n\n5.82\n\n2.56\n\n5.80\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n2.54\n\n50\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n(e)\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n(f )\n3.02\n\n6.10\nScatter\nMean value\n\nScatter\nMean value\n\n3.00\n2.98\n\n6.08\nG 23 [GPa]\n\nK23 [GPa]\n\n2.96\n\n6.06\n\n2.94\n2.92\n2.90\n2.88\n\n6.04\n\n2.86\n2.84\n6.02\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n(g)\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n2.82\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n(h)\n\nFigure 3.10: Computed effective transverse elastic properties as a function\nof δ for different values of Vf for COMP1: Vf = 0.22 (a-b); Vf = 0.29 (c-d);\nVf = 0.36 (e-f ); Vf = 0.44 (g-h).\n\n3.4 Discussion\n\n55\n\n6.6\n\n2.5\n\nScatter\nMean value\n\n6.4\n\nScatter\nMean value\n2.3\nG 23 [GPa]\n\nK23 [GPa]\n\n6.2\n6.0\n\n2.1\n\n5.8\n1.9\n\n5.6\n5.4\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n1.7\n\n50\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n(a)\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n(b)\n\n7.4\n\n3.0\n\nScatter\nMean value\n\n7.2\n\nScatter\nMean value\n2.8\n\nG 23 [GPa]\n\nK23 [GPa]\n\n7.0\n6.8\n6.6\n\n2.6\n\n2.4\n\n6.4\n2.2\n\n6.2\n6.0\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n2.0\n\n50\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n(c)\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n(d)\n3.8\n\n8.4\nScatter\nMean value\n\n8.2\n\nScatter\nMean value\n\n3.6\n\n8.0\n3.4\nG 23 [GPa]\n\nK23 [GPa]\n\n7.8\n7.6\n7.4\n7.2\n\n3.2\n3.0\n2.8\n\n7.0\n2.6\n\n6.8\n6.6\n\n2.4\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n(e)\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n(f )\n4.5\n\n9.6\nScatter\nMean value\n\n9.4\n\nScatter\nMean value\n\n4.3\n\n9.2\n4.1\nG 23 [GPa]\n\nK23 [GPa]\n\n9.0\n8.8\n8.6\n8.4\n\n3.9\n3.7\n3.5\n\n8.2\n3.3\n\n8.0\n\n3.1\n\n7.8\n7.6\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n(g)\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n2.9\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n(h)\n\nFigure 3.11: Computed effective transverse elastic properties as a function\nof δ for different values of Vf for COMP2: Vf = 0.22 (a-b); Vf = 0.29 (c-d);\nVf = 0.36 (e-f ); Vf = 0.44 (g-h).\n\n56\n\nComputational homogenization of composite and heterogeneous\nmaterials\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.12: Computed transverse elastic properties and Hashin-Hill bounds\nas a function of the volume fraction Vf for COMP1 and δ = 50.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.13: Computed transverse elastic properties and Hashin-Hill bounds\nas a function of the volume fraction Vf for COMP2 and δ = 50.\n\nChapter 4\n\nA hybrid virtual-boundary\nelement formulation\nIn this Chapter, a hybrid formulation based on the conjoined use of the recently developed Virtual Element Method (VEM) and the Boundary Element\nMethod (BEM) is proposed for the effective computational analysis of multiregion domains. VEM allows the straightforward employment of elements\nof general polygonal shape, maintaining a high level of accuracy. For its inherent features, it allows the use of meshes of general topology, including\nnon-convex elements. BEM is an effective technique for the numerical solution of sets of boundary integral equations, employed as the original model of\nthe represented physical problem. For several classes of problems, BEM offers\nsome advantages over more popular techniques, namely the reduction of the\ndimensionality of the problem, with associated computational savings. The\ninherent advantages of the VEM and the BEM are simultaneously employed\nto facilitate the study of heterogeneous material microstructures.\n\n4.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nVEM has been presented in Chapter 2 as a rapidly emerging generalisation of\nthe Finite Element Method (FEM). In Chapter 3 it has been shown how VEM\ncan provide accurate results when applied to mesh whose elements can have\nvery general shape, such in the case of polygonal elements with an arbitrary\nnumber of edges non-convex and highly distorted elements.\nThe Boundary Element Method has been developed over the last four\n57\n\n58\n\nA hybrid virtual-boundary element formulation\n\ndecades as a powerful numerical tool for the analysis and solution of many\nphysical and engineering problems [21, 55, 180] and today, it represents a viable alternative to other numerical approaches in many fields of engineering\nanalysis [7].\nBEM is based on the use and the numerical solution of integral equations, i.e. equations where the unknown functions appear under the integral sign. The use of integral equations for the analysis of potential field\nproblem appeared in the pioneering classical work of Fredholm [73]. The\nBoundary Integral Equation (BIE) method for the analysis of elastic problems\nwas introduced by Betti [53] and Somigliana [161]. Starting from these pioneering works, many authors have contributed to developing the method\n[125, 153, 65]. Among such contributions, the work of Lachat and Watson\n[108] was particularly influential for the development of a general numerical treatment of boundary-value equation problems. They introduced an\nisoparametric formulation, analogous to the one used for FEM analysis, and\ndescribed the numerical integration procedure in detail, thus demonstrating\nthe possibility of addressing complex three-dimensional elastic problems.\nThe first step for the boundary element analysis of any problem is describing the problem itself through a boundary integral equation. There are many\nways to obtain such representation, but a particularly attractive approach for\nsolids mechanics problems uses classical reciprocity theorems, such as Betti’s\ntheorem for elasticity, and special solutions of an auxiliary problem called fundamental solutions. The use of fundamental solutions, which represent the solution to the problem governing equations for some special cases, is the main\ndifference between BEM and other numerical methods. Such solutions are\nused as weighting functions and allow to reduce the discretisation requirements, incorporating in the formulation some knowledge about the governing equation solution itself. However, they must be known in advance for the\nmethod to be effectively viable. This point often has constituted a hindrance\nfor the application of BEM to some fields of application. However, today the\nfundamental solutions are known for many engineering problems.\nThe main advantage of boundary element techniques is reducing the degrees of freedom needed to model a given physical system. Such reduction is allowed by the underlying boundary integral formulation, which requires only the discretisation of the boundary of the analysed domain for\nits numerical solution. Consequently, the analysis of a two-dimensional domain requires the discretion of its one-dimensional boundary, while for threedimensional bodies, only their boundary surfaces have to be discretised. More-\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\n59\n\nover, due to the boundary only nature of the computational grid, stress concentrations areas can be modelled more effectively by increasing the mesh\ndensity locally around the area of interest without affecting the mesh’s quality\nelsewhere. As a result, BEM can capture high-stress gradients with very good\naccuracy and a limited pre-processing effort. Another aspect of noticeable interest is the capability to represent interior point displacements and stresses\ncontinuously, without making the analysis heavier. The interior points quantities are computed as a post-processing task without increasing the solving\nsystem’s size.\nBesides the computational cost savings, the reduction of the model dimensionality generally induces a pre-processing simplification, thanks to the need\nof discretising curves instead of surfaces, in the two-dimensional case, or surfaces instead of volumes, in the three-dimensional case. Such a feature may\nresult particularly appealing when materials morphologies with high statistical variability have to be automatically generated, meshed and analysed [46].\nBEM produces a linear system of equations whose coefficient matrix is neither\nsymmetric nor definite. Moreover, it results fully populated. Such features\nmake the system solution generally more demanding in memory storage and\ncomputational time with respect to FEM systems with the same number of\ndegrees of freedom. This aspect becomes particularly relevant for large scale\nsystems, as discussed in-depth in the next Chapter. Despite the last consideration, the above mentioned general advantages make BEM particularly attractive in some fields of investigations, such as Computational Mechanics,\nwhere the internal domain meshing can present some difficulty. BEM has\nbeen successfully employed to the solution of several classes of problems in\nfluids [180] and solids [7] mechanics and, more recently, in multi-scale materials modelling [156, 83, 42, 48, 79, 47, 50].\nIn the present Chapter, a hybrid computational technique, based on the\nsimultaneous use of the Virtual Element Method and the Boundary Element\nMethod is proposed with the idea that the conjoined use of VEM and BEM\nmight provide some benefits in the modelling of heterogeneous materials with\ncomplex microstructures [3, 61]. Unit cells with stiff inclusions embedded\nwithin a more compliant matrix, representative e.g. of the transverse section\nfibre-reinforced composites are considered. BEM is employed to model the\nmaterial inclusions, while VEM is used to represent the matrix. This choice\ncould be further motivated by the assumption that, under progressive loading, the stiffer inclusions would remain in the linear behaviour range, while\nthe matrix might undergo complex non-linear phenomena, e.g. hardening,\n\n60\n\nA hybrid virtual-boundary element formulation\n\ndamaging or fracturing processes, which could be modelled with the framework of VEM, taking advantage of the generality inherited by FEM and its\npeculiar ability to deal with elements of very general shapes.\nThis Chapter is organised as follows. Section 4.2 addresses the generation and meshing strategy for illustrative artificial morphologies. The BEM\nformulation for two-dimensional linear elastic problems is recalled in Section 4.3.4. In Section 4.4, the formulation of the hybrid virtual-boundary element method is described introducing the VEM-BEM coupling procedure.\nSection 4.5 discusses the application of the hybrid procedure to a case study\nrepresented by a matrix with complex-shaped inclusions, assessing the accuracy in terms of displacements and stresses. Section 4.6 the advantages of the\nhybrid VEM-BEM approach are exploited by applying the proposed method\nto the computational homogenization of unidirectional fibre-reinforced composites. Eventually, Section 4.7 recalls the key features of the proposed numerical technique.\n\n4.2\n\nReference morphology\n\nIn this Section, the procedures adopted for generating and meshing the artificial representation of the considered material microstructures are described.\nAs it will be shown in Section 4.4, the present formulation is based on a multi–\nregion approach, in which different phases are modelled using either a virtual\nor a boundary element approach, depending on several considerations, including the phase physics, as discussed in Section 4.7. An example is provided\nby the unit cell representative of a fibre–reinforced polymer composite, for\nwhich a certain number of inclusions, modelled, e.g. with the boundary element method, may represent the transverse section of the fibres, while the\nsurrounding domain, modelled with the virtual element method, may represent the polymer matrix.\nIn general, the considered two-dimensional unit cell may contain NV regions modelled with the virtual element method and NB domains modelled\nwith the boundary element method, so that the overall domain Ω is given by\n:N\n< :N\n<\nΩ=\n\n;V\n\nk =1\n\nΩV\nk\n\n∪\n\n;B\n\nk =1\n\nΩkB\n\n= ΩV ∪ Ω B ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere the superscripts V and B refer to virtual and boundary element regions\nrespectively. The overall domain is bounded by the contour Γ = ∂Ω, while\n\n4.2 Reference morphology\n\n61\n\nthe k–th subdomain ΩkB is bounded by the contour ΓkB = ∂ΩkB and the k–th\nV\nV\nsubdomain ΩV\nk is bounded by the contour Γk = ∂Ωk .\nThe virtual element regions can be meshed with generic polygonal elements, which ensures certain meshing flexibility, as discussed, e.g. in Ref.[116].\nOn the other hand, the boundary element regions only require consistent\nmeshes of their contours Sk and do not need any internal mesh, at least when\nthey do not experience any non-linear material process (e.g. plasticity and/or\ndamage). The meshing procedure must then interface the polygonal virtual\nelement mesh with the one-dimensional boundary element mesh. Due to\nthe inherent features of the virtual element method, which allows the natural treatment of generic polygonal elements and hanging nodes, the meshing\ncan be implemented without resorting to complex pre–processing algorithms.\nThe simple example geometry shown in Fig.(4.1), consisting of a square\nunit cell with an inclusion of arbitrary shape, is considered to describe the\nimplemented procedures. In this case, Ω = ΩV ∪ Ω B and Γ B = ∂Ω B is the\ninterface between the two regions. Once the morphology of the unit cell is\n\nFigure 4.1: A microstructure consisting of an arbitrary shaped inclusion\nwithin a surrounding matrix as an example two-dimensional heterogeneous\nunit cell. Boundary conditions are enforced on the boundary Γ = ∂Ω of the\nmicrostructure; Γ B is the interface between ΩV and Ω B .\ngeometrically reconstructed, the meshing procedure is based on the generation of a Voronoi tessellation [19] of the overall domain and the subsequent\nclipping of the internal inclusions to be modelled with BEM.\n\n62\n\nA hybrid virtual-boundary element formulation\n\nThe workflow of the overall procedure can be summarised as follows:\na) The micro–morphology is created as a two-dimensional geometric entity;\nb) A conformal triangular mesh of the overall domain is generated;\nc) A non-conformal polygonal mesh is generated as the Voronoi dual of\nthe triangular discretisation;\nd) The Voronoi cells falling within the inclusion domain are removed;\ne) The Voronoi cells intersecting the contour Γ B are clipped using the nodes\nand edges of the conformal triangular mesh, thus providing the sought\nconformal polygonal mesh.\nThe adjective conformal used above refers to the circumstance that the vertices of the initial triangular mesh and those of the target polygonal one lie on\nthe interface S between the two regions, thus identifying the interface mesh\nnodes, where suitable continuity conditions will be enforced to retrieve the\nintegrity of the domain.\nThe above procedure, schematically represented in Fig.(4.2), has been implemented in MATLAB. The geometry is represented as a collection of points\nand curves identifying each subdomain, which forms the input for generating the first conformal triangular mesh of the overall domain. This task has\nbeen performed using an unstructured mesh-generator for two-dimensional\ngeometries [70]. The target polygonal mesh is generated from the triangular\nmesh output using an in–house developed code that performs the following\nsequence of operations: a) retrieves the triangular mesh data structure; b) constructs a two-dimensional Voronoi diagram from the given triangulation; c)\nclips the polygonal mesh elements intersecting the interface Γ B , providing the\ntarget conformal polygonal mesh of the domain.\n\n4.3\n\nBoundary integral formulation\n\nIn this Section, the boundary element formulation for two-dimensional linear\nelasticity problems is reviewed, starting from classical reciprocity principles.\n\n4.3 Boundary integral formulation\n\n(a)\n\n63\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 4.2: Generation of the polygonal mesh of the artificial multi–region\nmorphologies: a) initial conformal triangular mesh of the overall domain; b)\ntwo-dimensional Voronoi diagram associated with the previous triangulation;\nc) target conformal polygonal mesh obtained by removing the Voronoi cells\nwithin the inclusion domain and clipping those intersecting the sub–domains\ninterface.\n\n4.3.1\n\nSomigliana identity\n\nThe Betti reciprocity work theorem states that if two linear elastic self equilibrated systems (ui , ti , bi ) and (ui∗ , ti∗ , bi∗ ) exist in a domain Ω B having Γ B as\nits boundary, then the work done by the forces of the first system on the displacements of the second is equal to the work done by the forces of the second\nsystem on the displacements of the first\n*\n\nΩ\n\nb∗j u j dΩ +\nB\n\n*\n\nΓ\n\nt∗j u j dΓ =\nB\n\n*\n\nΩ\n\nu∗j b j dΩ +\nB\n\n*\n\nΓB\n\nu∗j t j dΓ.\n\n(4.2)\n\nLet the second system represent the solution to the case of a unit point load\nacting on a point x0 of an infinite elastic domain\nb∗j = δij δ(x − x0 ),\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere δij is the Kronecker delta\nδij =\n\n%\n\n1\n0\n\nwhen i = j\nwhen i ̸= j\n\n(4.4)\n\nrepresenting the j-th component of the i-th unit vector of the two-dimensional\nstandard basis, and δ(x − x0 ) is the two-dimensional Dirac’s delta.

More specifically Gij∗ (x0 , x) and Hij∗ (x0 , x) represent respectively the displacement and traction component along the direction j at the point x when a unit point load\nis applied at the point x0 along the direction i. Eq.(4.5) is the well known\nSomigliana identity, which expresses the displacement at an interior point\nx0 ∈ Ω B in terms of the displacements and tractions at the boundary Γ B .\n\n4.3.2\n\nKelvin fundamental solutions\n\nThe knowledge of the kernels Gij∗ and Hij∗ plays a fundamental role in the\nformulation of any boundary element model. These functions are the Kelvin\nfundamental solutions and express displacements and tractions at the field point\nx due to the application of a unit point load at the source point x0 .\nUnder plane strain assumptions, the components of the Kelvin fundamental\ndisplacements are given by\n!\n\"\nGij∗ ( x0 , x) = C1 C2 δij ln r − r,i r,j ,\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhile the components of the Kelvin fundamental tractions have the form\nHij∗ ( x0 , x) =\n\n!\n\"\n!\n\",\nC3 +\nnk r,k C4 δij + 2 r,i r,j − C4 r,i n j − r,j ni .\nr\n\n(4.7)\n\nIn the previous expressions r = || x − x0 || is the Euclidean distance between\npoints x0 and x, the index notation f ,i = ∂ f /∂xi is adopted to denote differentiation, ni are components of the outward unit normal vector to the boundary\nΓ B at the generic smooth point x.

Its use alone, however, does not allow to solve the elastic problem. The solution of the elastic\nproblem can be found by writing Eq.(4.5) for points belonging to the boundary itself. However, since the kernels of the boundary integral representation present a singularity when r = ∥x − x0 ∥ → 0, the collocation on the\nboundary requires some attention. The boundary collocation can be accomplished through a limiting process involving an augmented domain Γ B ′ =\nΓ B − ΓεB + ΓεB ′ , (see Fig.4.3). Eq.(4.5) can then be written\nui (x0 ) + lim\nε →0\n\n*\n\nHij∗ (x0 , x)u j (x) dΓ(x) = lim\nB\n′\nε →0\nΓ\n\n*\n\nΓB ′\n\nGij∗ (x0 , x)t j (x) dΓ(x). (4.12)\n\nFigure 4.3: Limiting process for collocation on the boundary.\n\n66\n\nA hybrid virtual-boundary element formulation\n\nIt is easy to realize that when ε → 0 then Γ B ′ → Γ B . In calculating the two\nlimiting expressions, attention should be paid to the order of the kernels’ singularity. The limit involving the fundamental displacements can be written\n*\n\n*\n\nlim\nGij∗ (x0 , x)t j (x) dΓ(x) + lim\nGij∗ (x0 , x)t j (x) dΓ(x).\nε→0 ΓεB ′\nε→0 Γ B −ΓεB\n\n(4.13)\n\nConsidering that Gij∗ is of order O(ln r ), it can be shown that the first integral\ngoes to zero, while the second one can be evaluated as an improper integral.\nOn the other end, for the traction fundamental solutions, considering that Hij∗\ncontains a strong singularity of order O(r −1 ), the integral over Γε′ gives rise to\na jump term, which can be computed by expanding the displacements about\nthe source point x0 in a Taylor series. It follows\nlim\n\n*\n\nε→0 ΓεB ′\n\nHij∗ (x0 , x)u j (x) dΓ(x) = αij (x0 )u j (x0 ).\n\n(4.14)\n\nThe other contribution is treated in a Cauchy principal value sense\n*\n\n*\n\nlim\nHij∗ (x0 , x)u j (x) dΓ(x) = − Hij∗ (x0 , x)u j (x) dΓ,\nB\nB\nε →0 Γ − Γ ε\nΓB\n\n(4.15)\n\n/\nwhere the symbol − stands for Cauchy principal value.\nEq.(4.12) can then be written\n*\n\n[δij + αij (x0 )]u j (x0 ) + − Hij∗ (x0 , x)u j (x) dΓ(x) =\nΓB\n\n*\n\nΓB\n\nGij∗ (x0 , x)t j (x) dΓ(x)\n\n(4.16)\nIt can be shown that for smooth boundary points x0 , where the unit outward\nvector n(x0 ) is uniquely defined, the jump term αij = − 12 δij .

Eq.(4.17) represents the Displacement Boundary Integral Equation (DBIE) and it is the starting point for the construction of a\nboundary element model for two.dimensional elasticity.\n\n4.3 Boundary integral formulation\n\n4.3.4\n\n67\n\nThe Boundary Element Method\n\nThe numerical solution of Eq.(4.17) is based on the discretisation of Γ B and the\nsubsequent approximation of the boundary displacement and traction components in terms of shape functions and nodal values. More specifically, Γ B\nis subdivided into m straight segments sk , and two nodes are associated with\neach segment’s ends. In plane problems, each node carries two components\nof displacements and two components of tractions. Assuming Γ B as smooth,\nit follows that a tangent can be associated to any x ∈ Γ B , so that the existence\nof a unique value of traction at the node is ensured; corner points are not considered in the present formulation, although these could be treated resorting\nto known boundary element techniques [7].\nDisplacement and traction components are here assumed to be globally\ncontinuous over Γ B and to vary linearly over each boundary element sk according to\nu (ζ ) = N (ζ ) ũk ,\n\n(4.18)\n\nt (ζ ) = N (ζ ) t̃ k ,\n\n(4.19)\n\nwhere the vectors u (ζ ) and t (ζ ) collect the components of displacements and\npoints belonging to the segment sk , the matrix N (ζ ) ∈ R2×4 collects the onedimensional linear shape functions for the boundary segment sk , expressed\nas function of the natural coordinate ζ and ũk , t̃ k ∈ R4×1 collect the nodal\ncomponents of displacements and tractions associated with the two ends of\nthe boundary element sk .\nIt is worth noting that the shape functions N (ζ ), used for the boundary\nelement modelling of the inclusions, could be seen as restrictions over the element edges of the shape functions N (ξ, η ) appearing in Eq.(2.25), used in\nthe approximation of the virtual elements fields. Indeed, in the lowest order VEM, the restriction of the shape functions over the edges of a polygonal\nvirtual element is linear, which ensures consistency at the interface between\nmatrix (VEM) and inclusions (BEM).\nWriting Eq.(4.17) for the generic boundary node p and i = 1, 2 in matrix\nform gives\nm\n\nc ũ p + ∑\n\nq =1\n\n0*\n\nsq\n\n1\n\nm\n\nH pq (ζ ) N(ζ ) J (ζ ) dζ ũq = ∑\n\nq =1\n\n0*\n\nsq\n\n1\n\nG pq (ζ ) N(ζ ) J (ζ ) dζ t̃ q\n(4.20)\n\n68\n\nA hybrid virtual-boundary element formulation\n\nwhere c ∈ R2×2 depends on the geometry of the boundary at the considered\ncollocation point p, smooth in this case, ũ p ∈ R2×1 collects the components\nof displacements at the node p, H pq (ζ ), G pq (ζ ) collect the components of the\nfundamental solution, when the integral equations are collocated at the node\np and integrated over the element q, ũq , t̃ q ∈ R4×1 collect the nodal displacements and tractions associated with the ends of the generic boundary element\nsq , according to Eq.(4.18), and J (ζ ) is the Jacobian of the transformation between segment local and natural coordinates. After numerical integration 1 ,\nEq.(4.20) may be rewritten in compact form as\nH p UB = G p TB\n\n(4.21)\n\nwhere H p , G p ∈ R2×2m denote the rectangular matrices obtained by collocating at the node p and integrating over the whole boundary Γ B , while UB , TB ∈\nR2m×1 collect the components of displacements and tractions for all the nodes\nidentified on Γ B , with the superscript B introduced to highlight that such\nquantities are associated with the BEM domain. Writing Eq.(4.21) ∀ p ∈ [1, ..., m]\nproduces the set of linear algebraic equations\nH UB = G TB ,\n\n(4.22)\n\nwhere H, G ∈ R2m×2m collect matrix blocks of the form appearing in Eq.(4.21).\nIt is worth noting that, when the BEM domain identifies an inclusion in the\nanalysed domain, both UB and TB are unknown quantities that must be determined by interfacing Eq.(4.22) with the equations produced by the model\nemployed for the matrix domain.\n\n4.3.5\n\nDisplacements and stresses within BEM domains\n\nOnce the displacements and tractions at the boundary of the inclusions modelled with BEM are known, the value of displacements and stresses at points\nwithin the inclusions may be computed in post-processing.\nInterior points displacements may be computed employing the boundary\nintegral representation\nu j ( x0 ) +\n\n*\n\nΓB\n\nHij ( x0 , x) u j ( x) dΓ(x) =\n\n*\n\nΓB\n\nGij ( x0 , x) t j ( x) dΓ(x),\n\n(4.23)\n\n1 The numerical integration over the boundary is not a trivial process.

The numerical integration of such equations is generally\nstraightforward, except for internal points whose distance from the boundary\nis less than the employed boundary elements’ size. In such cases, the integrals\nappearing in Eqs.(4.23-4.24) become nearly singular, as the distance r ( x0 , x)\nbetween the collocation and integration points appears at the denominator of\nthe kernels Hij , Gij , Sijk , Dijk . In such cases, specific integration schemes may\nbe employed to enhance the accuracy of the integration, see e.g. Refs.[99, 181].\nIn the present work, a simple technique has been implemented: i) internal\npoints are selected so that their distance from the boundary is no less than\nhalf the boundary element length; ii) the Gauss quadrature order over the elements closer to the selected point is increased with respect to the order of\nintegration employed for the far elements. The method’s accuracy has been\nassessed in simple benchmark tests, and the absence of artefacts has been verified in the analysed test cases. However, the technique is not general, and the\nuse of specific schemes for nearly singular integrals should be considered in\ngeneral implementations [7, 99, 181].\nFor further details about the use of Eqs.(4.23-4.24) and their numerical\ntreatments, the interested readers are referred to Refs.[20, 7].\n\n4.4\n\nVEM-BEM coupling\n\nThe coupling between boundary and finite elements has been achieved in\nthe literature using various approaches [185, 56, 90, 39, 64]. The approach\nherein adopted to couple the virtual and the boundary element equations\nconsist in treating the BEM subdomains as macro-finite elements and in transforming the traction-displacement equations associated with them into force-\n\n70\n\nA hybrid virtual-boundary element formulation\n\ndisplacement equations that will eventually be assembled with the VEM equilibrium equations, already expressed in terms of nodal forces and displacements.\nIn Chapter 1 the equilibrium equation for the overall virtual element domain have been obtained. Here they are recalled for convenience\nKV UV = FV ,\n\n(4.25)\n\nwhere the superscript V is employed to identify terms stemming from the\nvirtual element model and differentiate them from those associated with the\nboundary element model of the inclusions.\nThe vectors UV and FV appearing in Eq.(4.25) collect the nodal components\nof displacements and forces of all the VEM nodes in the considered domain.\nSince only some of such nodes belong to the interface Γ B between boundary\nand virtual elements, it is possible to partition the vectors as\n0 V 1\n0 V 1\nUΓ\nFΓ\nV\nV\nU =\n,\nF =\n,\n(4.26)\nV\nUΩ\nFV\nΩ\nV\nB\nwhere UV\nΓ and FΓ identify components related to nodes belonging to Γ . In\nlieu of the decomposition in Eq.(4.26), the equilibrium equation (4.25) for the\nVEM subdomain can be rewritten as\n0 V\n10 V 1 0 V 1\nKΓΓ KV\nUΓ\nFΓ\nΓΩ\n=\n,\n(4.27)\nV\nV\nV\nKΩΓ KΩΩ\nUΩ\nFV\nΩ\n\nAlong the interface Γ B between the two subdomains, the nodal displacements and forces must satisfy the compatibility conditions for displacements\n\nand equilibrium conditions\n\nUB = UV\nΓ,\n\n(4.28)\n\nFB + FV\nΓ = 0,\n\n(4.29)\n\nwhich have been written considering that no external nodal forces act on the\nnodes belonging to Γ B . The displacement continuity equations can be readily\nwritten, as the displacement components appearing in the VEM system (4.27)\nand in the BEM system (4.22) carry the same physical meaning.\nOn the contrary, while nodal forces appear in Eq.(4.27), related to the VEM\nsubdomain, nodal components of tractions appear in Eq.(4.22), related to the\nBEM subdomain, so that it is necessary to retrieve a consistent expression of\n\n4.4 VEM-BEM coupling\n\n71\n\nthe nodal forces associated to the BEM tractions, before writing the equilibrium equations appearing in Eq.(4.29).\nFor a generic boundary element node, this can be accomplished by resorting to appropriate energy considerations. In the scheme adopted in this work,\nsince two-node piecewise linear continuous boundary elements are used, a\ngeneric node always lies at the conjunction between two contiguous boundary\nelements. It is here recalled that, in the considered two-dimensional background, boundary elements are one-dimensional segments, which are interfaced with the edges of the polygonal virtual elements. If the generic node i lies\nbetween the boundary elements sk and sk+1 , then, for a virtual displacement\nδũ ( xi ) ≡ δũi of the node i, the unknown nodal force F̃iB will perform some\nwork that has to be equivalent to the work performed by the tractions acting\non the two contiguous boundary elements. Thus, the following equivalence\nholds\nδu!i F̃iB =\n\nk +1 *\n\n∑ s δu! (ζ ) t (ζ ) J (ζ ) dζ,\n\nj=k\n\n(4.30)\n\nj\n\nwhich, recalling the interpolation expressed in Eq.(4.18), may be written as\nδu!i F̃iB =\n\nk +1\n\n∑ δũ j!\n\nj=k\n\n0*\n\nsj\n\n1\n\nk +1\n\nN(ζ )!

It is\nimportant to realise that Eq.(4.33) allows expressing F̃iB in terms of the traction components associated with the two elements containing the node i; for\n\n72\n\nA hybrid virtual-boundary element formulation\n\ntwo-node linear boundary elements such expression could be written as\nF̃iB =\n\ni +1\n\n∑ Mk t̃k ,\n\n(4.34)\n\nk = i −1\n\nwhere t̃k collects the components of tractions associated with the node k and\nMi ∈ R2×2 . Once Eq.(4.34) is written for all the boundary element nodes\nbelonging to Γ B , the nodal forces FB appearing in Eq.(4.29) can be expressed\nin terms of the boundary tractions TB appearing in Eq.(4.22) as\nFB = M TB ,\n\n(4.35)\n\nwhere FB , TB ∈ R2m×1 and M ∈ R2m×2m , with m expressing the total number\nof boundary nodes/elements.

The external edges of the\nsquare box are aligned with the global Cartesian reference system x − y.\nThe purpose of this numerical test is to compare the displacement and\nstress fields obtained with the developed technique with a benchmark finite\nelement solution, obtained employing an unstructured mesh of linear triangular elements. The analysis of the microstructure is performed with three different sets of homogeneous displacement boundary conditions corresponding\nto prescribed macro-strains ε̄ij : two uniaxial macro-strains acting along the x\nand y directions (BCx , BCy ) and a pure shear macro-strain acting to modify\nthe angle between the axes x − y (BCxy ).

However, while for the displacement field the two techniques show closer convergence rates, it emerges\nthat, for the stress field, the hybrid VE-BE technique approaches convergence\nnoticeably more rapidly than the pure virtual element scheme, at least when\nmeasured with respect to the number of degrees of freedom per unit area. The\nreason for such behaviour is twofold: i) in the hybrid technique, the nodes\n\n4.6 Computational homogenization of fibre-reinforced composites via the\nhybrid VEM-BEM approach\n81\n\nwithin the inclusions are removed due to the employment of the boundary\nintegral formulation, which contributes to the reduction in the number of degrees of freedom per unit area, this explaining the convergence patterns observed for the displacement field; ii) in the hybrid scheme, the stresses within\nthe inclusion are computed by employing, in post-processing, the boundary\nintegral representation given in Eq.(4.24), which generally ensures higher accuracy, with respect to standard FE methods, in the reconstruction of the internal stresses. The interplay between the reduction in the number of degrees\nof freedom associated with nodes within the inclusions and better rendering\nof the stresses due to the employment of the boundary integral representation\nof stresses explains the convergence patterns shown in Fig.(4.9).\nEventually Fig.(4.10) shows the plot of stress components σxx , σyy and σxy ,\ncorresponding to an enforced uniaxial strain ε̄xx = 0.05, computed with the finite element benchmark scheme, the virtual element implementation and the\nhybrid strategy, highlighting satisfying agreement among the three schemes.\n\n4.6\n\nComputational homogenization of fibre-reinforced\ncomposites via the hybrid VEM-BEM approach\n\nThis Section describes the application of the proposed hybrid VEM-BEM method\nto the computational homogenization of unidirectional fibre-reinforced composites. In computational homogenization, the macroscopic material properties are computed by simulating the micro-scale response of properly selected\nmaterial domains referred to as unit cells, and then averaging, over such domains, the fields of interest, to identify macroscopic links between such averaged quantities. Unit cells become representative volume elements (RVEs) when\nthey can be considered representative of the material’s mechanical behaviour\nat the macro-scale. Interested readers are referred to Ref.[137] for an in-depth\ntreatment of materials homogenization.\nThis test case is presented in this study for the following reason. One\nof the strategies employed for the computational homogenization of heterogeneous materials is based on the generation of a certain number of artificial digital samples of the considered material, with random features, and on\nthe computation of the ensemble averages, over the set of considered specimens, of suitable volume-averaged quantities, either stresses of strains, see,\ne.g. Refs.[102, 74, 46]. In this procedure, it is essential to ensure a suitable\nmesh quality for all the generated random microstructures, which may result\n\n82\n\nA hybrid virtual-boundary element formulation\n\nin a particularly challenging task. It is believed that the inherent features of\nVEM may benefit the meshing procedures in this kind of problems, i.e. when\na certain number of morphologies with statistical features need to be considered.\nThe unit cells for the present test lie in the plane x2 − x3 , normal to the\nfibres’ axes, which are parallel to the axis x1 . They are generated by randomly\nscattering a given number of arbitrarily shaped inclusions in a rectangular domain through an algorithm avoiding pathological superposition of the inclusions. The inclusions considered here present the transversal section shown\nin Fig.(4.11), are all of the same size and have and random orientation θ with\nrespect to the x2 axis. The average number of inclusions is determined by\nthe parameter δ = L/r, where L is the unit cell’s side length and r is the radius of the circle that circumscribes the fibre inclusion. Fig.(4.12) shows two\nexample geometries for a random microstructure and the subsequent VE-BE\ndiscretisations for δ = 20 and δ = 45.\nThe material constants of the composite constituents, isotropic in the x2 −\nx3 plane, are given in Table 4.11, in terms of transverse Young modulus E22\nand transverse shear modulus G23 . Assuming a Poisson random distribution of fibres within the unit cell and considering the constituents’ in-plane\nisotropy, the composite will be isotropic in the plane (x2 − x3 ) at the macroscopic level. Its transverse behaviour is then completely defined by two elastic\nmodula. In this study, the plane strain bulk modulus K̄23 and the transverse\nshear modulus Ḡ23 are considered.\nTable 4.11: Material properties for epoxy matrix and carbon fibres in transverse direction, as taken from Ref.[160].\nMechanical Properties\nAS4 carbon fibres\n3501-6 epoxy matrix\n\nE22 [GPa]\n15\n4.2\n\nG23 [GPa]\n7\n1.567\n\nThe problem of determining the appropriate size of the unit cell, or the\nappropriate number of inclusions within it, so to identify an RVE has been\nextensively investigated in the literature [170, 102, 166, 173? , 120, 104]. In\ngeneral, given a random microstructural sample subjected to a suitable set of\nboundary conditions, see, e.g. [102], the link between homogenized stresses\nand strains is provided by apparent properties, which may not be representative of the macro-material if the microstructural sample, or unit cell, is too\nsmall. As the unit cell size or the number of inclusions within it increase,\n\n4.6 Computational homogenization of fibre-reinforced composites via the\nhybrid VEM-BEM approach\n83\n\nthe unit cell becomes more representative of the macro-material, and the apparent properties approach the effective properties. Besides considering the\nbehaviour of the averaged properties versus the size or number of inclusions\nof the unit cell, the homogenization procedure can be enriched by considering ensemble averages of the volume homogenized properties over a set of\nunit cells with the same size and number of inclusions, but different spatial\ndistribution of the inclusions themselves. The procedure generally produces\nan estimate of the effective properties with unit cells smaller with respect to\nthe case in which only individual microstructures are considered, see, e.g.\nRef.[102] for a detailed discussion. In the present study, this homogenization\nprocedure is used. The interested readers are referred to Refs.[74, 46] for further examples about the application of the methodology.\nFor the considered composite, sets of unit cells at varying values of the\nparameter δ are considered, while the fibre volume fraction is kept constant\nat Vf = 0.25. For each value of δ, Ns = 50 different random sample micromorphologies have been generated and analysed using the proposed hybrid\napproach. Each unit cell Um , comprising several randomly located and orientated inclusions as in Fig.(4.12), has been discretised using arbitrary polygonal virtual elements for the matrix and a single boundary element domain\nfor each inclusion. Each Um is the subjected to three linearly independent sets\nof displacement boundary conditions, corresponding to three sets of enforced\nmacro-strains expressed in Voigt notation as ε̄ = {ε̄22 , ε̄33 , 2ε̄23 }. More specifically, the unit cells are loaded through displacements given by Eq.(4.38),\nwhere the following three sets of macro-strains\nε̄ a = {1, 0, 0} ,\n\nε̄ b = {0, 1, 0} ,\n\nε̄ c = {0, 0, 1} ,\n\n(4.41)\n\nare considered. Once a prescribed boundary condition is enforced, the microstructural problem is solved employing the proposed hybrid scheme, thus\nproviding the micro displacement, strain and stress fields within the microstructure. The averaged stresses σ̄ = {σ̄22 , σ̄33 , σ̄23 } are then computed as volume\naverages of the local micro-stress tensor over the domain of the unit cells, as\n1\nσ̄ij =\nΩ\n\n*\n\n1\nσij ( x) dΩ =\nΩ\nΩ\n\n2*\n\nΩV\n\nσij ( x) dΩ +\n\n*\n\nΩB\n\n3\n\nσij ( x) dΩ ,\n\n(4.42)\n\nwhere the domain integral is subdivided into contributions coming separately\nfrom the VE and BE regions. The integral over the BE regions can be further\nexpressed as a sum of integrals over each BE modelled inclusion ΩkB , and it\n\n84\n\nA hybrid virtual-boundary element formulation\n\nmay be demonstrated that\n*\n\nΩB\n\nσij ( x) dΩ = ∑\ni\n\n*\n\nΩkB\n\nσij ( x) dΩ = ∑\ni\n\n*\n\nΓk\n\nti n j dΓ,\n\n(4.43)\n\nwhich implies that the integration of stresses over the BE inclusions only require the computation of integrals along the boundary ΓkB of the inclusion of\nthe traction components ti , which are readily available from the BE solution,\nthus avoiding the more expensive use of Eq.(4.24). The use of Eq.(4.43) into\nEq.(4.42) allows remarkable computational savings in computational homogenization problems and constitutes a benefit of the presented technique.\nFor a given unit cell Um , the computation of the averaged stresses corresponding to the three considered sets of boundary conditions given in Eq.(4.41)\nallows populating the columns of the apparent elastic matrix C̄m , which links\naveraged stresses and strains according to\nσ̄ = C̄m ε̄.\n\n(4.44)\n\nFor each value of the parameter δ, once the components of C̄m are computed\nfor all the Ns = 50 generated random unit cells, a macroscopic apparent constitutive matrix ⟨C̄⟩ is computed from the ensemble average of the components\nof C̄m over the Ns samples, i.e.\n1 Ns\n⟨C̄⟩ =\nC̄m .\nNs m∑\n=1\n\n(4.45)\n\nThe apparent transverse elastic properties K̄23 and Ḡ23 associated to the considered value of δ are eventually obtained from the ensemble averaged matrix\n⟨C̄⟩.\nFig.(4.13) shows the values of K̄23 and Ḡ23 versus δ in plain strains, reporting both the values corresponding to individual samples Um and the ensemble\naveraged values. In general, the scatter of the individual values decreases as\nδ increases as the unit cells approach the RVE by including a higher number\nof fibres. In the literature, several theoretical models have been introduced to\nprovide rigorous bounds for heterogeneous materials’ effective macroscopic\nproperties. In the present study, the computed effective material properties\nare compared with the Hashin-Hill bounds [89, 86], identified in Fig.(4.13) by\nthe boundaries of the grey region: it is observed that the values computed\nthrough the developed technique fall within such bounds, confirming its usefulness in computational homogenization applications.\n\n4.7 Key features of the hybrid VEM-BEM formulation\n\n4.7\n\n85\n\nKey features of the hybrid VEM-BEM formulation\n\nIn this Chapter, a hybrid computational technique has been developed to\nanalyse multi-region two-dimensional elastic problems for computational micromechanics applications. The method suggests the simultaneous use of the\nrecently emerged virtual element method and the highly accurate boundary\nelement method. Each of the two techniques offers some definite advantages.\nThe use of VEM in addressing complex mesh morphologies and problems\ninducing high mesh distortion has been demonstrated in the literature, as reviewed in Section 4.1, and in Chapter 3 when dealing with materials micromechanics problems. In the present framework, the advantages offered by\nVEM are twofold: i) in general, the method offers a powerful tool for meshing\nmorphologically complex domains, as those often encountered in statistical\nhomogenization procedures, see, e.g. Fig.(4.12), in which the regularity of the\nregions related to the different phases cannot be a-priori assumed; ii) thanks\nto the possibility of extending to VEM the features of FEM, in particular its\ngenerality in dealing with non-linear constitutive behaviours, in the proposed\nframework, the method can be employed for meshing phases likely to exhibit,\nin the loading process, non-linear behaviours such as plasticity, viscosity or\ndamage [61]. This is the case of composite materials subjected to loadings\nthat can initiate visco-plastic flows and/or damage in the matrix.\nOn the other hand, the Boundary Element Method has proven effective in\nthe accurate reconstruction of the elastic fields through a discretisation procedure involving only the boundary of the analysed domains, thanks to the\nunderlying integral formulation, alternative to methods based on the weak\nformulation of the considered boundary value problems. In particular, BEM\nis known for providing accurate solutions at reduced computational costs [7].\nThe method can be used for analysing non-linear problems, although its employment in linear problems is more widespread and straightforward. An\nimportant caveat about the use of BEM is related to the fact that the method induces non-symmetric and non-definite fully populated solving matrices, see,\ne.g. Ref.[20]. As long as the number of elements used for modelling each\ninclusion is limited, this does not require additional consideration, and the\npotential of BEM in reducing the computational burden is preserved. However, should an inclusion need several hundred boundary elements, the presence of fully populated blocks in the solving systems could reduce the computation’s effectiveness and increase the computational costs. These aspects\ncould be mitigated and effectively addressed by using fast iterative solvers\n\n86\n\nA hybrid virtual-boundary element formulation\n\nin conjunction with special matrix representations, e.g. fast multipoles [112],\nor hierarchical matrices [29, 43, 51, 44]. In the proposed framework, BEM\nis proposed for modelling microstructural phases not expected to develop\nnon-linear constitutive behaviour. This use is beneficial for two reasons, as\nalready mentioned in the previous Section: i) it allows to reduce the number of degrees of freedom needed for modelling the inclusions, thus reducing\nthe computational burden of the analysis; ii) it generally provides a more accurate representation of stresses within the inclusions, thus inducing a faster\nconvergence in the stress fields, as shown in Figs.(4.8-4.9).\n\n4.7 Key features of the hybrid VEM-BEM formulation\n\n10−2\n\n10−2\n\nVEM\n\neu\n\n10−3\n\neu\n\neu\n10−4\n\n10−4\n\n105\n\n106\n\n10−5\n103\n\n10−4\n\n106\n\n10−5\n103\n\n105\n\n104\n\n106\n\nNdo f /Unit area\n\nNdo f /Unit area\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n10−2\n\nVEM\n\n10−2\n\nVEM\n\nVEM/BEM\n\nVEM/BEM\n\n10−3\n\neu\n\neu\n\neu\n\n10−3\n\n10−4\n\n10−4\n\n105\n\n104\n\nVEM\n\nVEM/BEM\n\n10−3\n\n106\n\n10−5\n103\n\n10−4\n\n105\n\n104\n\n106\n\n10−5\n103\n\n105\n\n104\n\n106\n\nNdo f /Unit area\n\nNdo f /Unit area\n\nNdo f /Unit area\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f )\n\n10−2\n\n10−2\n\nVEM\n\n10−2\n\nVEM\n\nVEM/BEM\n\nVEM/BEM\n\n10−3\n\neu\n\neu\n\neu\n\n10−3\n\n10−4\n\n10−4\n\n104\n\n105\n\n106\n\nNdo f /Unit area\n(g)\n\nVEM\n\nVEM/BEM\n\n10−3\n\n10−5\n103\n\n105\n\n104\n\nNdo f /Unit area\n10−2\n\n10−5\n103\n\nVEM/BEM\n\n10−3\n\n104\n\nVEM\n\nVEM/BEM\n\n10−3\n\n10−5\n103\n\n10−2\n\nVEM\n\nVEM/BEM\n\n87\n\n10−5\n103\n\n10−4\n\n105\n\n104\n\n106\n\n10−5\n103\n\n105\n\n104\n\n106\n\nNdo f /Unit area\n\nNdo f /Unit area\n\n(h)\n\n(i)\n\nFigure 4.8: Comparison between the convergence of the VE solutions and that\nof the hybrid VE-BE solution in terms of displacements.

Such load conditions are\nlikely to induce a loss of the structure’s mechanical performance that might\nultimately end with its failure. Thus, the structure’s effectiveness widely depends on the capability to predict damage initiation and propagation up to\nthe point where the structure is no longer able to sustain its design loads and\nadequately perform its intended function. Such knowledge is essential during\nboth the initial material selection and the detailed engineering design stage of\na structure.\nMost failure phenomena in engineering material are due to the propagation and coalescence of microscopic defects. These microstructure modifications lead to irreversible material degradation, characterized by a loss of\nstiffness observed at the macroscopic scale. In the last decades, the scientific\ncommunity has put extensive and remarkable efforts into developing numerical techniques to simulate the damage and failure process at the microscopic\nscale with increasing computational efficiency and accuracy. The nowadays\nbroad use of heterogeneous materials like fibre-reinforced composite in the\nmost advanced structures broaden the design spectrum and add complexity\nto the simulation process due to some composite materials’ peculiar features,\nsuch as the inherent complexity of both their microscopic structure and their\n93\n\nDamage and fracture damage in heterogeneous materials via the hybrid\n94\nVEM-BEM approach\n\nfailure process.\nThis Chapter aims to present further applications of the hybrid VEM-BEM\nformulation introduced in Chapter (4) by exploiting its peculiar features for\nmodelling damage phenomena in heterogeneous materials [115, 118]. This\nChapter is organised as follows: in Section 5.1 a crack propagation study in\nthe matrix phase of fibre-reinforced composite materials is performed within\nthe framework of Linear-Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). In Section 5.2\nthe proposed hybrid formulation is extended to a non-linear framework by\nadopting a constitutive law based on an isotropic damage model for the VEM\nsubdomain. Several applications are discussed, including the analysis of matrix degradation in a fibre-reinforced composite unit cell under progressive\nloading by implementing a damage model combined with a non-local integral regularisation technique for the matrix phase modelled with VEM.\n\n5.1\n\nCrack propagation in FRC\n\nFibre-reinforced composites (FRC) materials may experience different types of\ndamage mechanisms that strongly influence a structural component’s overall\nbehaviour. Many of these damage mechanisms often occur at the microscopic\nlevel, with the initiation and propagation of cracks. Analysis of such damage mechanisms is often performed via computational methods, and many\nnumerical techniques such as FEM, BEM [103, 18, 155, 8, 94], XFEM [184, 95],\namong others, have been employed to model crack propagation processes .\nThe need for an accurate description of the evolution of micro-defect may\nlead to simulations requiring heavy computational effort. In this Section,\ncrack propagation analysis in the matrix phase of fibre-reinforced composite\nmaterials is performed, taking advantage of the hybrid VEM-BEM formulation features developed in Chapter (4).\n\n5.1.1\n\nModelling approach\n\nWith finite element techniques, crack propagation is modelled explicitly by\nconsecutively adapting the domain’s spatial discretization. The simplest method\nto simulate crack propagation is the nodal release technique, where a crack is\nextended by a certain increment along the element edge up to the next node.\nHowever, such a method restricts the crack propagation along the element\nedges, introducing a dependence of the computed crack path on the mesh\n\n5.1 Crack propagation in FRC\n\n95\n\ntopology. More powerful but complex methods may combine element modification techniques, such element splitting, with advanced re-meshing strategies, in which the overall mesh is progressively updated starting from a finer\nmesh in the proximity of the crack tip region. Such a continuous mesh refinement/coarsening process may generally affect large regions of the analysis\ndomain, due to the need of preserving a conform transition between the remeshed propagation region and the surrounding areas, and it is thus a computationally intensive operation [107].\nOn the other hand, VEM can handle polygonal elements of arbitrary shapes.\nThis distinctive feature allows a substantial simplification of the re-meshing\nprocedure following the propagation of a crack. Indeed, using VEM elements\nallows avoiding mesh dependency of the crack propagation direction, as any\ncomputed crack path can be represented by modifying the topology of the\nvirtual element over which the crack propagation is occurring, including the\ncrack edges as new element edges, without the need of further re-meshing.\nThe algorithm that governs crack path generation and tracking for the proposed methodology may be broken down into two steps: (i) linear static analysis and crack path computation; (ii) cracking and mesh modification.\nInitiation of the fracturing process is assumed to start from a node of a\nboundary element and the same procedure can be employed either when the\ncomputed crack length increment is large enough to split an element completely or when it splits this element only partially. In both the aforementioned cases, the resulting element topology is valid from the VEM’s standpoint and does not need any further mesh modification. Moreover, to improve numerical accuracy near the crack tip, a local mesh refinement can be\nintroduced by subdividing one or more of the local elements in any number\nof elements of arbitrary shape, without necessarily affecting large portions of\nthe analysed domain. This can be achieved by exploiting another peculiar\nVEM feature, namely its capability to naturally handle hanging nodes since a\nVEM element can be a polygon with an arbitrary number of aligned vertices.\nA schematic of the VEM’s modelling benefits in crack propagation modelling\nis shown in Fig.(5.1).\nSummarising, using VEM for crack propagation modelling allows to: a)\navoid any crack path mesh-dependency, thanks to the possibility of capturing\nthe crack propagation direction by modifying the topology of few elements\nin the proximity of the crack tip; b) improve the accuracy of the fields reconstruction in the proximity of the propagation region, thanks to the possibility\nof performing local mesh-refinements at low computational costs, without the\n\nDamage and fracture damage in heterogeneous materials via the hybrid\n96\nVEM-BEM approach\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 5.1: Schematic of crack propagation modelling with VEM elements: (a)\ncomputed crack path; (b) elements splitting; (c) local mesh refining.\nneed to update and optimize the mesh in large regions of the computational\ndomain.\n\n5.1.2\n\nNumerical example\n\nIn this Section, the hybrid technique based on the simultaneous use of BEM\nand VEM is applied to the analysis of crack propagation in fibre reinforced\ncomposite materials with the analysis of the growth of kinked cracks originating from the partial fibre-matrix debonding in a unit cell of a fibre-reinforced\ncomposite material subjected to a transverse load [122].\nBEM is used to model the fibres, which are not expected to develop nonlinear behaviours, while the VEM is employed to model the matrix, which\nmay experience crack initiation and propagation. The inherent flexibility of\nthe VEM with respect to the admissible elements shapes is fully exploited to\navoid mesh-dependency in the crack propagation modelling, through a mesh\ntopology modification restricted only to the elements containing the crack tip\nnode. Such hybrid usage should in principle provide a reduction of the cost of\nthe analysis and flexibility in the study of the matrix cracking. In this work we\npresent some preliminary results and establish a workflow for future in-depth\ninvestigations.\nThe problem domain is the multi-region two-dimensional domain Ω ⊂ R2\nwith external boundary Γ = ∂Ω, shown in Fig.(5.2). It is assumed that no\nbody forces act within Ω, but either displacements or tractions can be enforced\non the boundary Γ. Ω is the union of two sub-domains, namely ΩBEM and\n\n5.1 Crack propagation in FRC\n\n97\n\nΩVEM , which represent, respectively, the transverse section of a fibre and the\nthe surrounding polymer matrix in a polymer fibre-reinforced composite. The\ntwo sub-domains share the interface S. ΩVEM is partitioned into a number of\npolygons of general shape, while the boundary S = ∂ΩBEM is divided into a\nnumber of straight segments, which form the edges of the polygonal elements\nin ΩVEM lying in proximity of the interface between the two sub-domains.\n\nFigure 5.2: Geometry of the analysis domain: the BEM is employed to model\nthe inclusion while the VEM models the surrounding matrix.\nThe test case, shown in Fig.(5.3), represents the transverse section of a composite material unit cell consisting of a single fibre and the surrounding matrix, subjected to a tensile load σ̄ acting parallel to the x axis. It is supposed\nthat a crack has first grown along the interface, partially debonding the fibre\nfrom the matrix [143]. The extension of the debonded zone is identified by the\nangle θd = 65◦ . Outside the debonded zone, the inclusion is perfectly bonded\nto the matrix. Two kinked cracks start from both ends of the debonded zone.\nThe growth of the kinked cracks takes place only in the matrix material. The\nexternal boundary of the matrix domain is a square whose side has length\nL = 1 mm. The inclusion is represented by a circle of diameter D = 0.15 mm.\nThe centre of the circle coincides with the centre of the square. The initial\ncrack length is a = D/10. The initial kinked crack runs parallel to the y-axis.\nThe model is symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\nA carbon fibre/epoxy matrix composite is considered. Both the fibre and\n\nDamage and fracture damage in heterogeneous materials via the hybrid\n98\nVEM-BEM approach\n\nFigure 5.3: Schematic of the unit cell containing a single fibre partially\ndebonded from the matrix.\nthe matrix materials are treated as linear elastic under plane strain assumptions. The materials of matrix and fibre, respectively, are considered as isotropic\nand transversely isotropic in the analysis plane. Transverse elastic properties\nare: Young’s modulus EF = 13.5 GPa and Poisson’s ratio νF = 0.25 for the\nfibre and EM = 2.79 GPa, νM = 0.33 for the matrix.\nOverall, 96 linear boundary elements are employed to model the fibre and\n12034 polygonal virtual elements to model the matrix, giving a total of 48306\ndegrees of freedoms.\nIn this example, Linear-Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) is applied, i.e.\ngeometrical and material non-linearities are excluded.

A constant value\n∆a = D/10 has been used.\nThe computed crack propagation path for the unstable growth of the two\nkinked cracks is shown in Fig.(5.5). The obtained results agree well with previous results in [143] and, due to the relative orientation of the kinked cracks\nwith respect to the applied load, the crack growth is, as expected, dominated\nby Mode I.\n\nFigure 5.5: Simulated crack propagation in the considered test case.\n\n5.2 Applications of an isotropic damage model\n\n5.2\n\n101\n\nApplications of an isotropic damage model\n\nIn this Section, an extension of the hybrid virtual-boundary element formulation presented in Chapter (4) for modelling regions exhibiting isotropic damage is described. Within the continuum damage context, some recent applications of BEM can be found, for instance, in Refs. [123, 121], while VEM has\nbeen recently applied in its lowest-order VEM formulation for modelling the\nstrain-softening response of concrete-like materials as reported in the literature [68]. The present application, albeit being of general application, is ultimately aimed to model the degradation of the matrix phase of unidirectional\nfibre-reinforced composite material.\n\n5.2.1\n\nVEM for domains exhibiting isotropic damage\n\nContinuum damage mechanics [100, 151, 92] describes the progressive loss\nof material integrity due to the propagation and coalescence of microscopic\ndefects. These microstructure changes lead to irreversible material degradation, characterized by a loss of stiffness observed on the macroscopic scale.\nDifferent approaches have been proposed to model the growth and effects of\ndistributed microscopic defects at the macroscopic scale.\nIsotropic damage models [109, 157, 158, 60] are the simplest damage mechanics models. They are based on the simplifying assumption that the loss of\nintegrity of the material is caused by an equal degradation of the bulk and\nshear moduli, governed by a single internal scalar damage variable, ω. This\nvariable is used to track and measure the loss of the material’s stiffness and\ngrows monotonically within its admissible range 0 ≤ ω ≤ 1 where 0 represents the undamaged material and 1 a fully degraded material. Under such\nassumptions, the constitutive equations for an isotropic damage model are\ndefined by [110]\nσ = (1 − ω ) C0 ε = (1 − ω )σ̃,\n(5.7)\n\nwhere, in Voigt notation, σ and ε collect, respectively, the stress and strain\ncomponents, C0 is the elasticity matrix for the pristine elastic material, and σ̃\nrepresents the stress components that would be associated to the strains ε in\nthe undamaged material.\nThe evolution of damage is triggered upon fulfilment of the activation\nthreshold condition\nF (ε) = τ (ε) − r = 0,\n\nr = max {τ (λ)} ,\nλ∈H\n\n(5.8)\n\nDamage and fracture damage in heterogeneous materials via the hybrid\n102\nVEM-BEM approach\n\nwhere τ (ε) is a suitably chosen norm of the strains, used to determine if the\nconsidered stress state belongs to the elastic domain, when F (ε) < 0, or if\nit induces damage initiation or evolution, F (ε) = 0, and the monotonically\nincreasing internal variable r represents the damage threshold at the current\nloading step λ and it is a function of the loading history H.\nDifferent choices for the threshold function τ (ε) are available in the literature, defining different shapes of the elastic domain in the strains space. An\nexpression proposed by Mazars [126] and frequently used in the modelling of\nquasi-brittle materials, e.g. concrete, defines τ (ε) as\nB\nC3\nC\nτ ( ε ) = D ∑ ⟨ ε i ⟩2 ,\n(5.9)\ni\n\nwhere ε i are the principal strains and ⟨·⟩ are the Macaulay brackets such that\n⟨ε i ⟩ = (ε i + |ε i |) /2.\nTo model the damage onset and progress of materials having different degradation behaviours in tension and compression, different expressions for the\nthreshold function are used, such as the one introduced in Refs.[119, 140],\nwhich reads\nE\nτ (ε) = β 2Ψ0 (ε),\n(5.10)\nwhere\n\n1 T\nε σ̃,\n(5.11)\n2\nis the initial elastic stored energy function of the undamaged material. The parameter β in Eq.5.10 allows modelling materials having different degradation\nbehaviours in tension and compression and is given as\nΨ0 ( ε ) =\n\nβ = m+\n\n1−m\n,\nn\n\n(5.12)\n\nf\n\nwhere n = fct is the ratio between the compressive strength f c and the tensile\nstrength f t of the material and θ is a weighting factor defined as\nm=\n\n∑3i=1 ⟨s̃i ⟩\n,\n∑3i=1 |s̃i |\n\n(5.13)\n\nwhere s̃i are the components of the effective principal stress tensor and ⟨·⟩ are\nthe Macaulay brackets.

To model the onset and\nevolution of damage in such materials, Melro et al.[130] proposed the following law\nc − Xt )\n3 J̃2\nĨ1 ( Xm\nm\nτ (ε) = c t +\n,\n(5.14)\nc Xt\nXm Xm\nXm\nm\nt and X c are, respectively, the tensile and compressive strengths of\nwhere Xm\nm\nthe epoxy resin and Ĩ1 and J̃2 are, respectively, the first stress invariant and the\nsecond deviatoric stress invariant; both quantities are defined using the effective stress components σ̃ that would be active in the undamaged material.\nThe evolution of damage is governed by the Kuhn-Tucker flow rules, which\nread\nF ≤ 0, ṙ ≥ 0, ṙ F = 0,\n(5.15)\n\nand allow distinguishing between loading and unloading conditions. Unloading occurs when τ̇ ≤ 0; otherwise, damage evolves, and the following\nconsistency condition must be satisfied\nḞ = τ̇ − ṙ = 0.\n\n(5.16)\n\nWhile the chosen definition for the threshold function defines the shape of\nthe elastic domain in the strain space, the shape of the stress-strain diagram\nafter damage onset is guided by damage evolution law that expresses the dependence of the damage variable ω on the internal variable r.\nDifferent choices can be found in the literature for the function ω (r ). A rather\nsimple one is the linear softening law which reads\n0\n\n1\nrf 4\nr0 5\nω (r ) =\n1−\n· H (r − r0 ) ,\nr f − r0\nr\n\n#\n$\nr = max τ (λ), r f ,\nλ∈H\n\n(5.17)\n\nwhere H (·) denotes the Heaviside step function, the parameter r0 identifies\nthe damage initiation condition and r f limits the maximum admissible value\nof the state variable r. The value of the damage threshold r0 can be inferred\nfrom the stress-strain diagram under uniaxial tension and depends on the\nexpression chosen for the threshold function.\nAn exponential softening can be instead modelled by adopting a damage law\n\nDamage and fracture damage in heterogeneous materials via the hybrid\n104\nVEM-BEM approach\n\ndefined as in Ref.[97] as\n0\n2\n31\nr0\nr − r0\nω (r ) = 1 − exp −\n· H (r − r0 ) ,\nr\nr f − r0\n\nr = max {τ (λ)} , (5.18)\nλ∈H\n\nwhere r f controls the exponential softening response behaviour.\nUnder uniaxial tension, the stress-strain relation has the form\n%\nEε\nif r ≤ ε 0\nσ(ε) =\n[1 − ω (r )] Eε if r > ε 0\n\n(5.19)\n\nwhich is valid for all the previously defined damage laws, if the threshold\nfunction is defined according to Eq.(5.9), thus leading to the equivalence r0 =\nε 0 and r f = ε f . A graphical representation of the elastic and damage behaviour for the simple case of a bar under uniaxial tension with linear (Eq.(5.17))\nand exponential (Eq.(5.18)) softening, is shown in Fig.5.6.\nft\n\nStress\n\nDamage\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\nε0\n\n0\n\nεf\nStrain\n\n·10−4\n\n0\n\nε0\n\nεf\nStrain\n\n·10−4\n\nFigure 5.6: Damage-strain diagram (left) and tress-strain diagram (right) for\nthe case of a bar under uniaxial tension.

As in non-linear finite\nelement formulations, the non-linear constitutive laws appearing in Eq.(5.7)\ncan be treated using standard incremental-iterative algorithms.

The tangent material stiffness matrix Ctan is\nconsistently computed from the constitutive law in Eq.(5.20) as\nCtan (t, x, εΠ , H) =\n\n5.2.2\n\n∂σ\n.\n∂εΠ\n\n(5.21)\n\nRegularisation techniques\n\nIn the previous Section, the essential components of isotropic damage models\nhave been presented. Although these models are relatively simple to implement, their numerical application may lead to physically unrealistic results\nbecause the damage process localises in a zone of the discretisation whose\nsize depends on the mesh elements’ size. As a consequence, the computed\nforce-displacement curves are mesh-dependent. Thus, damage models require regularisation techniques to correct localised zones’ thickness and avoid\nthe numerical results’ sensitivity to the mesh size. Two alternative regularisation techniques are commonly used, namely, the so-called crack band theory\n[28, 139, 140] and the integral-type non-local damage models [146, 96, 27, 54, 98].\nIn this Section, the formulations of both regularisation approaches are reviewed.\nCrack band theory\nIn numerical simulation involving a numerical discretisation of the analysis\ndomain, the damage growth localises into a band of width hb whose value\ndepends on the size, shape and orientation of finite elements. To overcome\nthis mesh-dependency issue, local regularisation methods based on the crack\nband theory introduce an explicit dependence of specific parameters regulating the damage-related softening process depending on the mesh elements’\nsize.\nConsidering the uniaxial stress-diagram in Fig.(5.6) and assuming the linear softening damage law in Eq.(5.17), the area under the stress-strain diagram represents the energy dissipated per unit volume, defined as\ngf =\n\n* ∞\n0\n\nσ(ε) dε =\n\n1\nft ε f\n2\n\n(5.22)\n\nDamage and fracture damage in heterogeneous materials via the hybrid\n106\nVEM-BEM approach\n\nIf the damage localises into a band of size hb , the energy dissipated per unit\narea at complete failure is g f hb . This quantity must be equal to the fracture\nenergy G f , which is a material property, so that\ngf =\n\nGf\nhb\n\n(5.23)\n\nAccordingly, to Eq.(5.23), the stress-strain diagram is no longer considered a\nunique curve characterising the material response but must be adjusted according to the size of the localised damage band hb , which in turn depends\non the finite element mesh. Since the tensile strength of the material must remain independent of the finite element discretisation, to verify Eq.(5.23) for\nevery value of hb , the only parameter that can be adjusted is ε f . Substitution\nof Eq.(5.22) in Eq.(5.23), one obtains\nεf =\n\n2G f\nhb f t\n\n(5.24)\n\nEq.(5.24) states that the value of the parameter ε f increases with decreasing\nsize of the local mesh elements’ size and, in turn, of the localised damage band\nhb , leading to a more ductile behaviour of the stress-strain curve. Conversely,\nas the local mesh elements’ size increases, the value of ε f must decrease. A\ncondition on the minimum value of ε f , motivated by physical evidence of the\ndamage process, prescribes that ε f must not be smaller than the limit elastic\nstrain under uniaxial tension ε 0 . This condition leads to a restriction on the\nmaximum size of the localised damage band which can be stated as\nhb ≤ hb,max =\n\n2G f\nε0 ft\n\n(5.25)\n\nIn a two-dimensional modelling framework, the crack band size can be estimated as the element area’s square root. However, this approach can induce\nsignificant errors when the crack band is not aligned with the mesh or when\nelongated, or more generally, distorted mesh elements are used. For mesh elements of arbitrary shape, a more general approach consists in estimating the\ncrack band size by projecting the element onto the direction perpendicular to\nthe assumed crack band direction [98].\nAs noted in Ref.[98], the advantage of such an approach is that the algorithmic structure of the finite element code requires only minor modifications,\nlimited to the part of the code responsible for the evaluation of the state variables corresponding to a given strain increment.\n\n5.2 Applications of an isotropic damage model\n\n107\n\nIntegral-type non-local damage model\nNon-local damage models assume that damage parameters at a point do not\ndepend only on the strain state at the point under consideration. In general, the integral-type non-local approach consists in replacing the value of\na certain variable at a certain material point with its non-local counterpart\nobtained by weighted averaging over a spatial neighbourhood of each point\nunder consideration. Given some local field f ( x) defined in a domain V, the\ncorresponding non-local field is defined as\nf ̄( x) =\n\n*\n\nV\n\nα( x, ξ ) f (ξ ) dV,\n\n(5.26)\n\nwhere x is a certain material point, ξ is one of its neighbour points and α( x, ξ )\nis a given non-local weight function that depends on the relative position between the two points.\nDifferent integral-type non-local regularisation models are known in the\nliterature [96] which differ on the variable on which the non-local regularisation is based. The non-local approach herein used consists in replacing the\nlocal value of the equivalent strain τ ( x) with its weighted average τ̄ ( x) over\na region surrounding each material point x p\nτ̄ ( x p ) =\n\n*\n\nΩ\n\n! \"\nα( x p , xq )τ ( xq ) dΩ xq ,\n\n(5.27)\n\nwhere Ω is the analysis domain. Eq.(5.27) embodies the assumption that\nstrains (and stresses) at a certain point depend not only on the state variables\nat that point but also on the distribution of the state variables over the whole\nbody or over a finite neighbourhood of the point under consideration. A required property of the non-local operator α consists of not altering a uniform\nfield, which means that the weighting function must satisfy the normalizing\ncondition:\n*\n! \"\nα( x p , xq ) dΩ xq = 1 ∀ x p ∈ Ω.\n(5.28)\nΩ\n\nThis is achieved by adopting the following scaled expression for the non-local\nweight function\nα0 ( d )\n! \",\nα( x p , xq ) = /\n(5.29)\nα\nd\ndΩ\nxq\n(\n)\n0\nΩ\nwhere α0 (d) is a non-negative weight function of the distance d = || x p − xq ||\nbetween two considered material points, monotonically decreasing for d ≥ 0.\n\nDamage and fracture damage in heterogeneous materials via the hybrid\n108\nVEM-BEM approach\n\nThe weight function α0 is often chosen as the Gauss distribution function\n2\n3\nd2\nα0 (d) = exp − 2 ,\n(5.30)\n2lc\nwhere lc is known as the internal length or characteristic length of the non-local\ncontinuum, a parameter that depends on the heterogeneous material properties. Another common choice is the truncated quadratic polynomial function\nα0 ( d ) =\n\nF\n\nd2\n1− 2\nR\n\nG2\n\n,\n\n(5.31)\n\nwhere R is known as the interaction radius [96] and it is a parameter related to\nthe characteristic length lc .\nThe implementation of the non-local damage model based on averaging\nof equivalent strain requires the computation of the point-wise values of the\nnon-local equivalent strain. Afterwards, before damage is evaluated, the local\nequivalent strains are replaced by their non-local counterpart. The integral\ndefined in Eq.(5.27) is evaluated numerically at each point x p as\nτ̄ ( x p ) = ∑ wq α pq τ ( xq ),\n\n(5.32)\n\nq\n\nwhere xq are the coordinates of the integration points, wq are coefficients representing the weights of the chosen integration rule and α pq are the non-local\ninteraction weights between points p and q, defined as\nα pq =\n\nα0 (d pq )\n.\n∑d wd α0 (d pr )\n\n(5.33)\n\nWhen a weight function α0 with a bounded support is chosen, as in Eq.(5.31),\nα pq vanishes when the distance d pq between points p and q is greater than the\ninteraction radius R.\nIt is worth noting that in order for the non-local model to be effective, the\nmesh elements’ size within the zone where the damage process occurs must\nbe smaller than the interaction radius R. In the lowest-order VEM formulation, the computed strain field is constant over a generic mesh element, and\nno integration weight actually exist. The approach herein adopted consist in\nconsidering the centroid of each element as the evaluation point p (resp. q).\nThe corresponding weight is taken as the product of the area of the element p\n(resp. q) and its thickness.\n\n5.2 Applications of an isotropic damage model\n\n109\n\nDepending on the number of elements in the finite element model, the process of searching neighbour integration points within the interaction domain\ncentred at a certain integration point, and subsequent computation of the nonlocal interaction weights might be a computationally demanding task.\nIn order to decrease the computational cost, an efficient numerical implementation for non-local averaging can be built according to the following procedure whose steps are executed once for all points p:\n• Find all points q whose distance from point p is smaller than R, and for\neach of them evaluate a pq = w pq α0 (d pq );\n• Compute the sum a p = ∑q a pq ;\n• Divide each a pq by a p and store the results ā pq in a table where its position is associated with points p and q.\nThe procedure outlined above is performed only once as a part of the initialization tasks before the beginning of the incremental-iterative solution of\nthe non-linear problem.\nAt each iteration, the non-local equivalent strain at a generic point p can\nbe straightforwardly computed as\nτ̄ ( x p ) = ∑ τ ( xq ) ā pq\n\n(5.34)\n\nq\n\nwhere τ ( xq ) is the local equivalent strain at a generic point q within the interaction radius R and ā pq is the corresponding entry in the non-local averaging\ntable.\n\n5.2.3\n\nNumerical examples\n\nIn this Section, the developed hybrid VE-BE formulation is assessed in the\nnon-linear framework of damage modelling. Three numerical applications\nare considered. The first application consists in the so-called tension specimen\ntest [139] and aims to validate the non-linear virtual element formulation by\nadopting the local regularisation technique recalled in Section 5.2.2.\nIn the second application, where a three-point bending test involving a\nquasi-brittle concrete notched beam is considered, is meant to assess the accuracy of the non-linear virtual element formulation against cases available in\nthe literature by implementing an isotropic damage and the non-local regularisation approach recalled in Section 5.2.2. The last application validates the\n\nDamage and fracture damage in heterogeneous materials via the hybrid\n110\nVEM-BEM approach\n\nsame damage model by employing the hybrid VE-BE formulation. This test\nconsiders a unit cell consisting of a circular elastic fibre in epoxy matrix where\npartial debonding between fibre and matrix triggers damage onset and evolution. All the numerical experiments have been performed using an in-house\ndeveloped MATLAB code which addresses all the stages of the computations, as\nwell as pre- and post-processing tasks.\nTension specimen test\nThis numerical example simulates a case where a localisation is generated\nby a non-uniform stress field. The specimen, whose geometry and boundary\nconditions are shown in Fig.(5.7), has a central neck inducing localisation in\nthe zone with minor cross-section. The thickness of the specimen is t = 20\ncm. Material parameters are Young’s modulus E = 20000 kp/cm2 , Poisson’s\nratio ν = 0.2, tensile strength f t = 10 kp/cm2 and fracture energy per unit\narea G f = 0.125 kp/cm. The threshold function τ is computed following\nthe definition in Eq.(5.10). The adopted damage law is the linear softening\nf\nlaw defined in Eq.(5.17). The initial damage threshold is set as r0 = Et and\nthe maximum admissible value r f is obtained, depending on the mesh size,\naccordingly to Eq.(5.24), where hb is computed considering the projection of\nmesh elements’ geometry on the horizontal axis.\n\nFigure 5.7: Geometry and boundary conditions of the tension specimen test.\nNumerical tests have been performed with different meshes to determine\nconvergence with mesh refinement and the regular/irregular mesh element\nshapes’ influence. Specifically, two types of mesh are adopted. The first mesh\ntype consists of 8-node convex polygonal virtual element discretisations with\n\n5.2 Applications of an isotropic damage model\n\n111\n\ndifferent refinement levels, referred to as mesh C1, C2, C3 and C4. The second\nmesh type, referred to as mesh NC4, consists of non-convex 8-node polygonal\nvirtual elements obtained by randomly perturbing the position of the nodes\nof mesh C4.

As reported in Fig.(5.9), convergence for progressive meshrefining is achieved for both types of meshes and both the original results\nin Ref.[139] and more recent results in Ref.[68] are correctly replicated. As\n\nDamage and fracture damage in heterogeneous materials via the hybrid\n112\nVEM-BEM approach\n\nreported in Ref.[139], damage localises within the first rows of elements that\nare closer to the central neck, as shown in Fig.(5.10) for mesh C4 and mesh\nNC4.\n\nForce [kp]\n\n7500\n\nC1\nC2\nC3\nC4\nNC4\n\n5000\n\n2500\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\nDisplacement [cm]\n\n0.03\n·10−2\n\nFigure 5.9: Force-displacement diagram for the tension specimen test.\n\nThree-point bending test\nThe three-point bending (TPB) test is considered a benchmark to validate\nthe implemented VEM for isotropic damage combined with an integral-type,\nnon-local regularisation technique. This numerical example investigates damage initiation and evolution up to a notched concrete beam’s failure, where the\ndamage growth is dominated by mode I loading.\nGeometry and boundary conditions for this problem are shown in Fig.(5.11).\nThe beam has square cross-section of side H = 100 mm and spans W =\n450 mm. The notch is A = 5 mm wide and extends up to one half of the\nbeam height. These dimensions correspond to the experiments performed in\nRef.[105]. The material’s Young’s modulus is E = 20 000 MPa and the Poisson’s ratio is ν = 0.2.

The threshold function τ is\ncomputed following the definition of Mazars in Eq.(5.9) and the non-local interaction radius is set to R = 4 mm. The tests have been performed, under\n\nDamage and fracture damage in heterogeneous materials via the hybrid\n114\nVEM-BEM approach\n\nplane strain assumptions, using three different meshes of polygonal elements\nto determine convergence with mesh refinement. The two coarser meshes,\nreferred to as V1 and V2, contains 6072 and 8493 elements and are shown in\nFig.5.12. A further finer mesh, referred to as V3, is considered an over-kill\ndiscretisation, and it contains 18546 polygonal elements.\n\nFigure 5.11: Geometry and boundary conditions of the three-point bending\ntest.\nThe simulations are performed in displacement control using a NewtonRaphson scheme. Results are observed in terms of force versus displacement\nat the point where the vertical displacement is applied and compared with\nexperimental results from Ref.[105] and with numerical results from Ref.[97].\nThe computed force-displacement curves, the reference numerical solution\nfrom Ref.[97] and the experimental bounds from Ref.[105] are depicted in\nFig.(5.13). They reveal good agreement with the experimental bounds for the\nmost part of the force-displacement diagram for all the considered discretisations. Comparison with the reference numerical solution obtained with full\nintegrated 4-node bilinear isoparametric elements and mesh size of 1.67 mm,\nshows a better reproduction of the experimental data in the first part of the\nsoftening branch. A slight underestimation of the computed load can be noticed in the last part of the curve’s softening branch. This difference, already\nnoted in Ref.[68], where a similar numerical test with polygonal virtual elements has been performed, is likely due to the unstructured character of the\nvirtual element mesh with respect to the finite element reference mesh. The\nevolution of the damage profile is shown in Fig.(5.14): damage originates at\nthe bottom of the notch and grows in a limited zone along the structure’s vertical axis of symmetry.\nThe presented results validate the implemented VE isotropic damage model,\n\n5.2 Applications of an isotropic damage model\n\n115\n\nwhich will be used in the next computational test.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.12: Polygonal meshes used in the numerical simulation of the threepoint bending test: (a) mesh V1, (b) mesh V2.\n\nTransverse failure of a composite fibre-reinforced unit cell\nIn the present Section, the hybrid virtual-boundary element formulation, combined with an isotropic damage model for the regions modelled with virtual\nelements, is used in the computational simulation of the damage evolution\nunder transverse tensile loading of a unit cell comprising a single fibre embedded in an epoxy matrix, with initial partial debonding between fibre and\nmatrix.

In the initial configuration, it is assumed that the circular fibre is debonded from the matrix in the interface region identified by |θd | ≤ 70◦ , see Ref.[143].

The\nframework has been based on the lowest-order formulation of the Virtual Element Method (VEM) and applied to computational homogenisation problems and failures analysis at the microscale of polycrystalline and unidirectional fibre-reinforced composite materials. Several aspects of applying the\nVEM formulation to microstructural material modelling have been investigated and addressed in this work.\nIn the introductive Chapter (1), the still relevant interest within the field\nof computation micromechanics for the development of computational techniques capable of dealing with complex and evolving geometries and meshes\nwith accuracy, effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness has been reviewed introducing VEM as the numerical technique chosen for this research work for\nits peculiar features, the robust treatment of complex mesh features and simplification of the analysis’s pre-processing stage, being among them.\nThe core features of VEM have been discussed in Chapter (2), where the\ntwo-dimensional lowest order formulation for linear elasticity problems has\nbeen reviewed. Stemming from the work performed for this thesis, some\npractical aspects of VEM implementation have been discussed, highlighting\nboth its common feature and difference with a standard FEM implementation\nwith respect to mesh generation and handling and computational cost associated to the assembly of the system of equations.\nIn Chapter (3) an application of VEM for computational homogenisation\nof composite and heterogeneous materials has been presented. The selected\napplications have been focused on modelling the transverse mechanical behaviour of polycrystalline and unidirectional fibre-reinforced composite materials. The study has shown that VEM’s capability to deal with very general polygonal mesh elements, including non-convex and highly distorted ele121\n\nDamage and fracture damage in heterogeneous materials via the hybrid\n122\nVEM-BEM approach\n\nments, can be profitably exploited to relax the mesh quality requirements that\nmay hinder the automatic analysis of micro-morphologies presenting complex or highly statistically varying features. This research activity has also\ndriven the development of a polygonal mesh generator for general multiregion domains bounded with convex or non-convex boundaries, whose robustness has been proven in the discretisation of polycrystalline and composite microstructures.\nIn Chapter (4), a novel two-dimensional hybrid virtual-boundary element\nformulation for the analysis of multi-region two-dimensional elastic problems\nhas been presented. The numerical tests performed on composite materials\nwith inclusions of complex shape have assessed the advantages of the proposed formulation. The proposed method’s accuracy has been tested against\npure FEM and VEM solution of the same problem. The application of such\na novel formulation to the computational homogenisation problem of a composite material with randomly distributed inclusions of complex shape is also\nreported. With respect to standard FEM or VEM discretisation, beside a further simplification pre-processing stage, the inherent reduction of the system’s\ndegrees of freedom has led to an appreciable decrease in the analysis’s computational cost associated with the global system matrix assembly and the\nsystem solution.\nIn Chapter (5), further applications of the proposed hybrid VEM-BEM formulation for modelling damage phenomena in heterogeneous materials have\nbeen presented. In the first part of this Chapter, it has been demonstrated how\nthe use of VEM within the framework of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics\ncan be extremely useful for simulation of crack propagation, as its inherent\nflexibility concerning the shapes of the admissible elements can be fully exploited to avoid mesh-dependency of the computed crack propagation path.\nSimultaneously, mesh topology modification can be restricted only to the elements containing the crack tip node. In the second part of Chapter (5), the\nproposed hybrid formulation has been extended to a non-linear framework\nby adopting a constitutive law based on an isotropic damage model for the\nVEM subdomain. The proposed application has concerned the analysis of\nmatrix degradation in a fibre-reinforced composite unit cell under progressive loading by implementing a damage model combined with a non-local integral regularisation technique for the matrix phase modelled with VEM. The\nFEM-like, straightforward VEM’s capability to include non-linear constitutive\nmodels, combined with the use of BEM to model the linear elastic behaving\ninclusion, has allowed an appreciable reduction of the degrees of freedom of\n\n5.2 Applications of an isotropic damage model\n\n123\n\nthe problem, thus reducing the computational cost associated with the global\nsystem matrix assembly and the problem solution.\nTo conclude, it is worth highlighting some further investigation directions\nthat may be identified for the proposed framework.\nLowest-order VEM, k = 1, has been employed in this thesis. However,\nhigher-order virtual element formulations have been proposed in the literature [31, 34, 35]. Higher-order formulations are based on: i) the definition of a\nlocal virtual element space, for trial and test functions, which contains the set\nof all polynomial functions up to the selected degree k plus a set of additional\nfunctions, whose explicit knowledge is never required for the construction of\nthe method; ii) the selection of a suitable set of degrees of freedom, grouped\ninto a set boundary degrees of freedom, associated to the element vertices and\nto points lying on their edges, which maintain the physical meaning of displacements, plus a set of internal degrees of freedom, which represents suitably\ndefined integrals, or moments, over the elements, of the functions belonging\nto the local virtual element space. If the virtual element space and the degrees\nof freedom are properly chosen, the projection operator, the stabilization term\nand, therefore, the local stiffness matrix entries can be still computed without the explicit knowledge of the unknown additional functions. However, as\nshown in Ref. [13], the procedure for determining the above quantities within\nhigher-order formulations requires the numerical evaluation of integrals of\npolynomial functions that require the use of suitable quadrature rules specific\nto polygons [162, 134].\nAs an example, a VEM of order k = 2 would imply a quadratic approximation of the displacements over the edges of the virtual elements, expressed\nin terms of nodal displacements associated with the vertices and to the midpoints of the edges, which could be readily coupled with a quadratic formulation of the boundary element model of the inclusions. The coupling between\nhigher-order virtual elements and higher-order boundary elements could be a\ndirection of further research and could lead to remarkable benefits in solution\naccuracy.\nAn important caveat about the use of BEM is related to the fact that the\nmethod induces non-symmetric and non-definite fully populated solving matrices, see, e.g. Ref.[20]. As long as the number of elements used for modelling each inclusion is limited, this does not require additional consideration, and the potential of BEM in reducing the computational burden is preserved. However, should an inclusion need several hundred boundary elements, the presence of fully populated blocks in the solving systems could\n\nDamage and fracture damage in heterogeneous materials via the hybrid\n124\nVEM-BEM approach\n\nreduce the computation’s effectiveness and increase the computational costs.\nThese aspects could be mitigated and effectively addressed by using fast iterative solvers in conjunction with special matrix representations, e.g. fast\nmultipoles [112], or hierarchical matrices [29, 43, 51, 44].\nAnother aspect that needs to be addressed in the framework of BEM and\nits coupling with VEM is the inclusions with sharp corners. The consideration\nof such geometrical entities is generally known to be problematic in BEM due\nto the non-unique definition of the normal at the corners. Some strategies to\naddress such an issue have been proposed in the literature [7, 82], consisting\nin the employment of semi-discontinuous elements or hyper-singular traction\nboundary integral equations, and their inclusion in the present framework\ncould be investigated in future studies.\nEventually, it is worth noting that the present technique has been hitherto developed only for two-dimensional problems. Although the considered\ntest cases allow highlighting the potential benefits of the proposed method,\n2D models generally present strong limitations in the computation of the effective properties of real materials, as they often neglect important inherent\nthree-dimensional morphological or physical material features. In fact, while\nin this work the scheme has been successfully employed to compute the transverse elastic constants of composite laminae reinforced by unidirectional fibres, it would not be possible to employ it to compute the in-plane properties,\nor even the transverse properties, of laminates with general lay-ups, due to\nthe impossibility of rendering in a 2D scheme the inherent 3D morphological\nfeatures related to the mutual orientation of the fibres belonging to different\ncontiguous laminae.\nFor such reasons, an interesting direction of further research could be related to the extension of the proposed scheme to three-dimensional problems.\nIn the literature, three-dimensional formulations have been developed both\nfor VEM and BEM, see, e.g. Refs.[77, 7]. The coupling between the two techniques in the 3D case could be readily applied, for example, to the computational homogenisation of polycrystalline materials, which has been successfully addressed separately both with VEM [124] and BEM [46, 45, 83, 48], both\nin the case of linear and non-linear material behaviour. Polycrystals represent\nanother class of materials for which three-dimensional effects, related to the\nmutual orientation of the crystallographic lattices of different grains in the 3D\nspace, play an essential role in determining the macroscopic effective properties.\nEventually, the extension of the present virtual-boundary element frame-\n\n5.2 Applications of an isotropic damage model\n\n125\n\nwork to the analysis of multi-phase microstructures exhibiting general nonlinear behaviours, along the lines discussed above, and the analysis of threedimensional micro-morphologies and a comprehensive investigation about\nthe computational advantages offered by the framework, can form the object\nof further investigations.\n\nDamage and fracture damage in heterogeneous materials via the hybrid\n126\nVEM-BEM approach\n\nBibliography\n[1] J.
