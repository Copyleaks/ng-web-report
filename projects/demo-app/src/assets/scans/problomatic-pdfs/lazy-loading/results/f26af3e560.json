The profusion of digital fabrication tools and technologies make evident\nsuch distinctions in the context of design production but at the same time carry potential for\nmaterial and fabrication-based processes promoting generative design methods. Such\nstrategic application and customization of digital fabrication tools, inherent in and inclusive to\nthe process of design generation, require the knowledge and skill-set of production\nassociating material to its fabrication and assembly methods. The paper addresses the area\nof fabrication based design and the term Rapid Gestalt is proposed to suggest that certain\nskills acquired through fabrication-customization processes, achieved through material\nformation, may contribute to fabrication-guided design protocols. Through the demonstration\nof some design experiments for multi functional and responsive structural skin systems, the\npaper classifies several forms of fabrication-informed production processes in which the\nnotion of Rapid Gestalt is manifested through material selection, fabrication-method and\nassembly logic. The conception, development and application of such classification express a\nshift in contemporary design discourse promoting the notion of mass customization in the\ncontext of generative processes of design fabrication.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nDesign by virtue of its very nature is largely\ndominated by formal exploration. Its\nphysical manifestation however, is\nfundamentally perceived by way of\nimplementation and deemed reductive\nand/or limited as far as generative design\nmethods are considered [1]. The rapid\ndevelopment of digital-design fabrication\nmethods challenge such processes of\nproduction promoting design that is\ninformed by fabrication, as opposed to\nsimply being (free-) formed by it.\n\nThe question still remains: what is the\nrelation between the ways in which things\nare made and how they work (beyond their\nformal uniqueness)? Can fabrication\nmethods affect material formation within\nthe early design stages? Furthermore,\nwhat are the ways in which such relations\nmay be classified and understood in order\nto promote efficiency of use and effect of\napplication between the design artefact\nand the tool which assisted its fabrication?\nSuch questions carry relevance for process\n(methodology) and function (application) of\ndigital design in that they may potentially\npromote a significant fit or connection\n\nmailto:neri@mit.edu\n\n\nbetween the artefact and its context\n(whether user and/or environment).\nFabrication-based design prioritizes the\ntools and fabrication methods being\nassigned to generate material form and\nbehaviour over manifestations which are\npurely formal in nature [2].\n\nTheoretical Foundations\n\nFactory to File\nIn the words of David Pye, technology is\n“the study and extension of technique” [3].\nTechnique denotes a specific approach for\naccomplishing a given task or function by\nway of perceiving and putting into use\nmaterial integrity and processing methods.\nA hierarchical approach tends to prevail\nwhere fabrication methods and material\nconsiderations are only brought into the\ndesign process as final design solutions in\npreference to promoting explorations which\nare generative in nature.\nHowever, the material and technique in\nwhich a natural artefact has been formed is\ndirectly linked to its behaviour [4]. So ways\nof making things are inextricably linked to\nwhat and how they serve as final artefacts.\nThe work of the craftsman involves the\nknowledge and skill-set of particular\npractical arts. A craft of any kind which\nembodies the skill set and techniques of\nselecting and processing material is\ninherent to and apparent in the final\nartefact [3]. Thus, process of material\nformation, or Gestalt, are directly linked to\nthe methods by which they have been\nproduced.\nToday, rapid prototyping technologies offer\nthis knowledge to the people. But there’s\nobviously more to the notion of rapid craft\nthan simply hitting the power switch.\n\nMachining is by convention a form of\nexecution, a final phase. “File to Factory”\nprotocols have indeed pushed ahead our\nvision as designers with regards to efficient\nCAD/CAM/CAE processes [5] and yet the\nother way around, “factory to file”, has\nnever been considered. In other words,\nmachine execution should not be regarded\nsimply as a service tool for materializing\ndesign but rather an opportunity to inform\nthe design process as one which integrates\nmachine-logic across all scales of\nproduction. This notion extends from\nSimondon’s view of the craftsman\nengaging both his knowledge and creativity\nin the process of making, beyond acting as\nmachine servant or assembler [6]. Material\nchoice and fabrication methods are not\ninnocent decisions but rather pre-\ndetermined factors which could potentially\nguide the design with respect to both\nartefact and process.\n\n\nFigure 1 Tropisms: Light-responsive structural systems and logic dependency graph\nillustrating parametric association between physical features and environmental conditions.\n\n\nMachine Immanence and Naïve\nMaterialisation\nAn intelligent wall or a responsive skin is,\nat its simplest, an environmental\nmanifestation of technology that is already\nbeing appropriated [7]. However, in much\nof the work generated recently which falls\nunder the umbrella of “responsive skins”\nthere still exists a separation, both in\nprocess and authorship, between “what” a\nbuilding senses and “how” it does so.\nElectronics is mostly embedded in the\nartefact post its production rather than\nconsidering the association between the\nsensors and the sensing elements of the\nbuilding. In most of the work shown here,\nthe digital presence (or any proof of CAD)\nis in most cases absent: complex\ngeometrical form is fabricated in physical\n\n\nmatter, and sensors are embedded within it\nas potentially seamless and ubiquitous\nelements enhancing material response to\nlocal stimuli. One of the crucial ideas that\nthis work seeks to portray is that of\nintegrated sensing. Simply put, this means\nthat instead of “adding-on” sensors to the\nartefact, material choice and processing is\ntargeted towards, and guided by, an\nunderstanding of the mechanical and\nstructural properties which initiate dynamic\nbehaviour.\n\nRapid Gestalt\nIn his essay, “The gadget lover, Narcissus\nas Narcosis”, Marshall McLuhan defined\nthe relation between media and self as an\namalgam of tools and bodily extensions\nseamlessly at work [8]. The\n“servomechanism” is an adaptation of the\nself to its technological extensions such\nthat a closed system is created whereby\nthe detection of such extensions as\nindividual entities is unattainable. In this\nlight, the designed artefact may be\nperceived as an entity weighted with\ncommensurate “extensions”. The tool,\ntechnique or technology applied for\nproduction has as much value and\nmeaning as the artefact itself, inherently\npromoting explicit effects which are the\nresult of an intentional affinity between\nmachine and material. Gestalt, in general,\nproposes such an affinity between the\nmaker and its immediate context, the\nenvironment, which is to contain the object\nof desire. As such, beyond its traditional\ndescription or meaning, Gestalt may be\nreinterpreted as a set of instructions\ncombining knowledge and application,\nmatter and tools relating form to processes\nof formation; an operational framework for\nprocessing and re-organizing material\nconstructs. Thus Gestalt may potentially\nserve as a guiding instruction-set, a\nformalism, which merges knowledge of\napplication with a naive instrumentality of\nmaterial organization.\n\nAims\nMaterial and fabrication based design\ndenotes design processes that are\ninformed by material and/or fabrication\nconstraints as part of the generative\n\nphases of design. The aim is to develop a\npreliminary taxonomy which attempts to\nredefine the use and application of digital\nfabrication tools and technologies through\nthe notion of craft. In this context the term\nRapid Gestalt (in German, Rapide Gestalt)\ndelineates the ability or potential to control\nmaterial formation and behaviour through a\nparticular fabrication method inherent in\nthe nature of the exploration.\n\nMethodology\nThis paper considers several design\nprojects for responsive structural skin\nsystems, from the perspective of Rapid\nGestalt, its significance and implications for\na design paradigm engaged with, and\nbrought about by material production.\nThree classes or types of “gestalt” are\ndemonstrated by each of the three projects\npresented. Each class defines a\nrelationship between the type of structure\nor morphology developed and the tools\napplied and/or customized to support\nmaterialization. In addition, each class\nassumes its initial point of departure with\nregards to a given phase of production.\nSuch phases include for example material\nselection, material fabrication and material\nassembly and are directly assigned to a\ngiven class of formation.\n\nDemonstrating Rapid Gestalt\nThe projects below demonstrate the notion\nof condition-based programming and\ninformed fabrication (or “Rapid Gestalt”)\nthrough the integration of structural and\nenvironmental performance data into form-\ngenerating processes. Each project\nexplores unique relationships between\nmaterial organization and behaviour,\ninherent in their form and attributed to the\nways and methods in which these objects\nhave been fabricated. It is precisely this\ninteraction between material organization\nand environmental pressures that is a\nnovel approach to the genesis of form.\nCombined with this aspiration, the projects\npostulate our ability as designers to exploit\ndigital fabrication technologies as a\ngenerative domain for material production\nMaking is not secondary to from-generation\nand directly ties to it, beyond its being an\nagency for production.\n\n\n5.1. Monocoque\n\nMonocoque (French for \"single shell\")\nstands for a construction technique that\nsupports structural load using an object's\nexternal skin. This stands in contrast with\nusing an internal framework (posts and\nbeams) that is then covered with a non-\nload-bearing skin. The project\ndemonstrates the notion of a structural skin\nusing a voronoi pattern, the density of\nwhich corresponds to multi-scalar loading\nconditions. The distribution of shear-stress\nlines and surface pressure is embodied in\nthe allocation and relative thickness of the\nvein-like elements built into the skin. The\ncomposite prototype models represent\nthree strategies for the design and\nfabrication of single shell structures.\n\n5.2. Raycounting\nRaycounting is a method for originating\nform by registering the intensity and\norientation of light rays. 3-D surfaces of\ndouble curvature are the result of assigning\nlight parameters to flat planes. The\nalgorithm calculates the intensity, position\nand direction of one or multiple light\nsources placed in a given environment and\nassigns local curvature values to each\n\n\npoint in space corresponding to the\nreference plane and the light dimension.\n\n\nFigure 2. Monocoque: illustrated are three fabrication approaches\n\n\nThe models explore the relation between\ngeometry and light performance from a\ncomputational-geometry perspective. Light\nperformance analysis tools are\nreconstructed programmatically to allow for\nmorphological synthesis based on\nintensity, frequency and polarization of light\nparameters as defined by the user. The\nproject is inspired by one of the first rapid\nprototyping technologies from the 1860’s\nknown as photo sculpting. The method was\ndeveloped with the aim of regenerating\naccurate 3-D replicas of a given object by\nprojecting multiple prints of different angles\nand carving them relative to the reference\nartifact. Photo sculpting employs 2-D\nprojections to regenerate 3-D objects;\nRaycounting employs 2-D planes as they\nare informed by light to generate form.\n\n5.3. Subterrain\nThe physical features of a terrain represent\nthe distribution and magnitude of the forces\nthat have brought it about. These elements\nembody the complex relations between\n\n\nFigure 3. Raycounting: SLS nylon models (top) and printed resin composites including\nstructural pockets (bottom).\n\n\nphysical matter in its given environment\nand denote its subterranean force field.\nThe work explores the notion of material\norganization as it is informed by structural\nload and environmental conditions. 2-D\nmicro structural tissues are visualized,\nanalyzed and reconstructed in 3-D macro\nscale prototypes. Computational analysis is\nused to determine material behaviour\naccording to assigned properties and\nperformance such as force, stress, strain,\ndeformation, heat flux and energy such that\nthe tensor properties in atomic scale are\nkept isomorphic to the morphological\npattern. The tissue is then reconstructed\nusing a CNC mill and multiple types of\nwood composites. Anisotropic in nature,\ngrain directionality and layering are\ninformed by the analysis resulting in a\nlaminated structure which corresponds to a\nrange of loading conditions. Three micro\nscale biological tissues (a leaf section, a\nbutterfly wing and a scorpion paw) are\nreconstructed using this generative digital\nprotocol.\n\n\n5.4. Cartesian Wax\n\n\nFigure 4: Subterrain: Micro structural biological tissues structural compost (top) and\nperofrmance analysis (bottom).\n\n\nThe project explores the notion of material\norganization as it is informed by structural\nand environmental performance: a\ncontinuous tiling system is differentiated\nacross its entire surface area to\naccommodate for a range of conditions\naccommodating for light transmission, heat\nflux, and structural support. The surface is\nthickened locally where it is structurally\nrequired to support itself, and modulates its\ntransparency according to the light\nconditions of its hosting environment. 20\ntiles are assembled as a continuum\ncomprised of multiple resin types - rigid\nand/or flexible. Each tile is designed as a\nstructural composite representing the local\nperformance criteria as manifested in the\nmixtures of resin.\nThe work is inspired by the Cartesian Wax\nthesis, as elucidated by Descartes in the\n1640’s. The thesis relates to the\nconstruction of self knowledge and the way\nin which it is informed by and reports about\nan individual’s experience of the physical\nworld. According to Descartes, the\nknowledge of the wax is whatever survives\n\n\nthe various changes in the wax’s physical\nform. That is, the form of the wax embodies\nthe processes that have generated its final\nfeatures. Replace the notion of knowledge\nwith that of performance and the wax’s\nphysical form represents the force fields\nthat grant its birth.\n\n6.0 Conclusions\nIn his seminal work “The Work of Art in the\nAge of Mechanical Reproduction” Walter\nBenjamin poses the assumption that the\nvery nature of art is defined by (among\nother things) the way in which it has been\nproduced and materialized [9]. Such\nsupposition may indeed release us into the\ncomfort of revisiting the notion of “art” and\n“production” in the context of design and\ndigital technologies respectively.\nRapid Gestalt is a designation for the\nincorporation of craft materialization\nknowledge within the framework of CNC\nand RP processes of fabrication.\nTechnologies for incorporation of naïve\nmaterialization within fabrication and\nassembly processes may be said to be\ncases of fabrication-driven form generation\naccording to the various craft principles as\ndefined in this paper. The ability to recreate\nand apply tools and techniques of and for\nmaterialization, not only as motorized\nversions of their ancient ancestor-tools but\nrather as customized versions of a generic\nuniversal technology, points towards a\nconceptual shift for custom-fabrication from\na design perspective.\nThe depiction of design through fabrication\nmay sustain such material sensibility in\ndesign. This work attempts to establish\nrapid craft protocols for responsive\nstructural skin systems. Each exploratory\n\nphase aims at establishing a conceptual\nframework which may promote such novel\ninterpretations of digital design tools,\ntechniques and technologies. Finally, the\nnotion of a rapid craft is manifested in this\nwork as a design method which promotes\nthe creation of novel structural systems\nthrough processes of digital fabrication and\nassembly.\n\n\nFigure 5.
