By nature,\nand in its rite, the material practice of craft is informed by matter, its method of\nfabrication, and by the environment (Semper, 1851). As in Nature, when creation begins\nwith matter, morphogenesis, or the generation of form, is a process engendered by the\nphysical forces of Nature (Thompson, 1942; Thom, 1975). Similarly, in the framework of\nthis essay, Material is not considered a subordinate attribute of form, but rather its\nprogenitor. Such is the story of form told from the point of view of matter, and it begins,\nnaturally, with form’s predicament.\nForm’s Predicament: A Brief History\nOver the long trajectory of architectural design history, the design and production of\nartifacts has been characterized by a growing separation between form and matter. In\ncontradistinction to craft in which material and form are organically intertwined into a\ntradition of making, modern design and production have historically evolved away from\nthis integration, or in its absence, towards the compartmentalization of form-making as a\nprocess independent of its sources in material knowledge (Sennett, 2008). At least since\nthe Renaissance, with the emergence of architectural theories, form generation has\nbecome somewhat of a self-directed and autonomous body of knowledge. Within\narchitecture and industrial design, the most culturally sensitive of the productive design\nfields, form has grown in both eminence and temporal precedence in the design process\nto the point that the condition of form preceding materialization has become normative\nand virtually intuitive in contemporary design culture. With the exception of few\npioneering cases in contemporary design, the secularization and debasement of the\nmaterial realm has become axiomatic. Materiality has become, within the logic of the\nmodernist tradition, an agency secondary to form.\nThe Industrial Revolution lay open the door to machine-based manufacturing and mass\nproduction. The creation of form was now to be conceived and created by the power of\nindustrial automation, detached and independent of environmental forces and influences.\nThe values promoted by ancient crafts (not unlike Nature’s way), pronounced by the\nintegration of material substance and construction methods, once within the province of\nthe craftsman, were abandoned while in their place emerged a design practice based on\nvalues of mass production. Fast, cheap, repetitive and modular building types and parts\nwere synonymous with Ford’s visionary dream. Industry’s victory aside, it appeared as if\ndesign’s propinquity to ancient crafts and its design expressions as portrayed by\nvernacular forms of design was now doomed lost; and with it the intimate context of\nmaterial technologies. Eventually, this non-material approach to the design and the\nautomation of construction were to be reinforced under the command of computer aided\ndesign and engineering (Jencks, 1984).\n\n\nThe Digital Revolution, which marked the shift from analog to digital technology, has\ntransformed the designer’s drafting board into a digital canvas. Form, it seemed, was now\ndivorced completely from the physical reality of its manifestation. This new design space\nafforded much liberation in formal expression, but it has also broadened the gap between\nform and matter, and made the hierarchical and sequential separation of modeling,\nanalysis and fabrication processes infinitely more pronounced.\nThe implementation and broad absorption of enhanced computational design tools in\narchitectural practice has, since the early nineties, motivated a renaissance of the\nformalist project in architecture; geometrically complex shapes became emblems of\ncreativity in digital design environments and supported the design mastery of complex\ngeometries in form-generation. This formal and geometric design orientation has also\naddressed \"free form\" design and architecture along with their enabling technologies as\npart of the larger design phenomenon of \"non-standard\" form.\nDesigning (with) Nature: Towards a New Materiality\nToday, perhaps under the imperatives of growing recognition of the ecological failures of\nmodern design, inspired by the growing presence of advanced fabrication methods,\ndesign culture is witnessing a new materiality. Within the last decade in both industrial\ndesign and architecture, a new body of knowledge is emerging within architectural praxis.\nExamples of the growing interest in the technological potential of innovative material\nusage and material innovation as a source of design generation are developments in\nbiomaterials, mediated and responsive materials, as well as composite materials. With the\ngrowing relevance of “materialization”, new frontiers of material science and digital\nfabrication are supporting the emergence of new perspectives in architectural and\nindustrial design. Thus the role of digital design research as the enabling environment of\nthe transformation to a new age of material-based design in various design disciplines has\nbecome the cutting edge of computational design research. Here we are at the cusp of a\nnew paradigm inspired by the Troika structure of craft, at the interaction of Materials\nScience, Digital Fabrication and the environment.\nMaterial Ecology is an emerging field in design denoting informed relations between\nproducts, buildings, systems, and their environment (Oxman, 2010). Defined as the study\nand design of products and processes integrating environmentally aware computational\nform-generation and digital fabrication, the field operates at the intersection of Biology,\nMaterial Science & Engineering, and Computer Science with emphasis on\nenvironmentally informed digital design and fabrication.\nBitmap Printing: Fabricating Nature\nWith the advent of digital fabrication techniques and technologies, digital material\nrepresentations such as voxels (3-D pixels) and maxels (a portmanteau of the words\n'material' and 'voxel') have come to represent material ingredients, for instance in the\ncontext of additive manufacturing processes. Designers are now able to compute material\nproperties and behavior integrated into form-generation procedures.\n\nMotivated by the prospect of designing material behavior, a novel design and\ntechnological approach for biologically-inspired layered fabrication entitled Bitmap\nPrinting (Figure 1) has been defined, implemented and explored by the author, in\ncollaboration with Objet Ltd., The Mathworks and in the context of new design work\ncommissioned by the Centre Pompidou (Paris).\n\nFigure 1: The bitmap printing technique allows for the capturing of material property data in high\nresolution as a collection of bitmap files printed in 16μ resolution. Left: Curvature informed material\ndistribution (from blue to green); Right: Relative height informed material distribution (red to yellow).\nDesign: Neri Oxman in collaboration with Prof. W. Craig Carter, Objet Ltd., and The Mathworks, Centre\nPompidou, Paris 2012.

The aim was to implement material\nproperty and behavior combinations accommodating for multiple functions in the design\nof human armors including helmets, corsets, hip splints and various prosthetic devices.\nSpecifically, the work explored strategies for the integration of protective functions with\nflexibility and comfort implementing functional gradient digital fabrication (Oxman,\n2011, C). These experiments lay the methodological foundations for the generation of\nheterogeneous and functional prototype development using structural materials for\nhumanoid armor. In order to address geometrical constraints and allow for material\norganization modulation, both anatomical and physiological mapping were executed\nduring the analysis and the synthesis stages.\n\nAnatomical & Physiological Mappings (Analysis):\nCombining global organismal hierarchies informed by anatomical data with local tissue\ncomposition mappings informed by physiological data (i.e. μCT scans) the aim was to\nachieve a fully integrated armor which varies its mechanical, chemical, environmental\nand thermal properties accommodating geometrical (anatomical) features and physical\n(physiological) properties (Oxman, 2009).\nAnatomical & Physiological Fabrication Strategy (Synthesis):\nOn global anatomical scale, basic geometrical data describing the anatomical features as\ntransformable meshes were extracted. This network of curves and surfaces guided the\ndistribution of material properties as behavioral patches relating to the skeletal and\nmuscular systems. On the local physiological scale, μCT scan data converted to material\ndistribution data informed the allocation of stiff and soft materials. A novel digital\nfabrication method entitled Bitmap Printing that facilitates the 3d printing of 16μ\nphysical bits was implemented to support high-resolution digital fabrication of\nheterogeneous functional material gradients (Figure 2). Each material component within\nthe overall armor construction was designed and printed with varying physical properties\ninformed by multi-scalar mappings.\n\nFigure 2: Examples of bitmap printing demonstrating formal variation in color, thickness, porosity (right)\nand material property variation in 16 μ scale (left).

Medical scan data of\na human head is selected from an open repository. Two sets of data are created and\ntrimmed from the scan using medical imagining software simulating the hard tissue\n(skull) and the soft tissue (skin and muscle) (Fryazinov, 2011). Combined, these two data\nsets make up the bone-to-skin threshold informing helmet thickness and material\n\ncomposition according to its biological counterpart such that bony perturbations in the\nskull are shielded with soft lamellas designed as spatial sutures (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3: Tissue composition data extracted from μCT scan analysis informs geometrical and physical\nmaterial properties in the design of a helmet.

Towards a Material Ecology\nThe ability to design, analyze and fabricate using a single material unit implies unity of\nphysical and digital matter, enabling nearly seamless mappings between environmental\nconstraints, fabrication methods and material expression (Oxman, 2010, 2011A, B). Such\nunity - like that found in natural bone, a bird’s nest, a typical African hut and a woven\nbasket - might promote a truly ecological design paradigm, facilitating formal expression\nconstrained by, and supportive of, its hosting environment.\nLike Kahn’s brick arch (Kahn, 1969), the units of digital matter may be informed with\nvarious functions on their way to become and contribute to larger material organizations.\nThe designer’s voxel is equivalent to Kahn’s brick, in that when combined, these material\nunits can self-organize by way of mediating their physical properties with their external\nenvironment.\nUltimately, the faculty to author new forms of expression will depend on the craft\ntriptych (matter, fabrication, and environment) and its integration into the design practice\nas an undifferentiated scheme, able to process matter into shape as informed by the\nenvironment. Once achieved, architectural design will have arrived at an ecology of the\nartificial: a Material Ecology.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by an NSF EAGER grant award 1152550 “Bio-Beams:\nFunctionally Graded Rapid Design & Fabrication”.
